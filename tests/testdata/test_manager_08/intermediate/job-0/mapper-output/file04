we	1

feeling	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1

observationsâ	1
â	1
œthere	1
are	1

in	1

throw	1
some	1
suspicion	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1

of	1
the	1
peisistratid	1
compilation	1
at	1
least	1
over	1
the	1
theory	1
that	1
the	1
iliad	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
its	1
present	1
stately	1
and	1
harmonious	1
form	1
by	1
the	1
directions	1
of	1
the	1
athenian	1
ruler	1
if	1
the	1
great	1
poets	1
who	1
flourished	1
at	1
the	1
bright	1
period	1
of	1

of	1
which	1
alas	1
we	1
have	1
inherited	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
fame	1
and	1
the	1
faint	1
echo	1
if	1
stesichorus	1
anacreon	1
and	1
simonides	1
were	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
noble	1
task	1
of	1
compiling	1
the	1
iliad	1
and	1
odyssey	1
so	1
much	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
to	1
arrange	1
to	1
connect	1
to	1
harmonize	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
incredible	1
that	1
stronger	1
marks	1
of	1
athenian	1
manufacture	1
should	1
not	1
remain	1
whatever	1
occasional	1
anomalies	1
may	1
be	1
detected	1
anomalies	1
which	1
no	1
doubt	1
arise	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
homeric	1
age	1
however	1
the	1
irregular	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
digamma	1
may	1
have	1
perplexed	1
our	1
bentleys	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
helen	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
caused	1
as	1
much	1
disquiet	1
and	1
distress	1
as	1
the	1
fair	1
one	1
herself	1
among	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
her	1
age	1
however	1
mr	1
knight	1
may	1
have	1
failed	1
in	1
reducing	1
the	1
homeric	1
language	1
to	1
its	1
primitive	1
form	1
however	1
finally	1
the	1
attic	1
dialect	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
assumed	1
all	1
its	1
more	1
marked	1
and	1
distinguishing	1
characteristicsâ	1
still	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
language	1
particularly	1
in	1
the	1
joinings	1
and	1
transitions	1
and	1
connecting	1
parts	1
should	1
not	1
more	1
clearly	1
betray	1
the	1
incongruity	1
between	1
the	1
more	1
ancient	1
and	1
modern	1
forms	1
of	1
expression	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
in	1
character	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
period	1
to	1
imitate	1
an	1
antique	1
style	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
piece	1
out	1
an	1
imperfect	1
poem	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
as	1
sir	1
walter	1
scott	1

done	1
in	1
his	1
continuation	1
of	1

œif	1
however	1
not	1
even	1
such	1
faint	1
and	1
indistinct	1
traces	1
of	1
athenian	1
compilation	1
are	1
discoverable	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
poems	1
the	1
total	1
absence	1
of	1
athenian	1
national	1
feeling	1
is	1
perhaps	1
no	1
less	1
worthy	1
of	1
observation	1
in	1
later	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
fairly	1
be	1
suspected	1
in	1
earlier	1
times	1
the	1
athenians	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
ordinarily	1
jealous	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
their	1
ancestors	1

amid	1
all	1

in	1
the	1

most	1

part	1

which	1
relate	1

knight	1
suspects	1
to	1
be	1
interpolations	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
indeed	1
that	1
in	1
its	1
leading	1
outline	1
the	1
iliad	1
may	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
historic	1
fact	1
that	1

have	1
been	1
the	1
most	1

ally	1
of	1

sovereign	1
the	1
preeminent	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
poetry	1
on	1
the	1
trojan	1
war	1
may	1
thus	1
have	1
forced	1
the	1
national	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
athenians	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
their	1
taste	1
the	1
songs	1
which	1
spoke	1
of	1

no	1

of	1
far	1
inferior	1
sublimity	1

popularity	1

at	1
first	1
sight	1
a	1

would	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
emanated	1
from	1
an	1
athenian	1
synod	1
of	1
compilers	1
of	1
pg	1

related	1
the	1
wrath	1

it	1

still	1
surprising	1
that	1

should	1
never	1

the	1

must	1

can	1

down	1
nothing	1
respecting	1

persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
fine	1
taste	1

elegant	1
mind	1
of	1
that	1
athenian31	1
would	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
preserve	1

it	1
to	1
say	1

are	1

that	1

little	1
else	1
than	1
a	1
version	1
of	1
the	1

story	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
peisistratus	1

its	1
historical	1
probability	1
must	1
be	1
measured	1
by	1
that	1
of	1
many	1
others	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
spartan	1
confucius	1

will	1
conclude	1
this	1
sketch	1
of	1
the	1

an	1

by	1
an	1

down	1

merely	1
recitations	1

at	1
this	1
period	1
about	1
four	1

a	1
poet	1
flourished	1

the	1
name	1
of	1
melesigenes	1

most	1
probably	1
the	1
former	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
these	1
ballads	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
great	1
utility	1
to	1
his	1
purpose	1
of	1
writing	1
a	1
poem	1
on	1
the	1
social	1
position	1
of	1
hellas	1

as	1
a	1

did	1
not	1
affix	1
his	1
own	1
name	1
to	1
the	1
poem	1
which	1
in	1
fact	1
was	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
remodelled	1
from	1
the	1
archaic	1
dialect	1
of	1
crete	1
in	1
which	1
tongue	1
the	1

found	1
by	1
him	1

therefore	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
poem	1

this	1

rather	1
a	1

thus	1
given	1
some	1

notion	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
theories	1
which	1
have	1
developed	1
themselves	1
respecting	1
this	1
most	1
interesting	1
subject	1
i	1
must	1
still	1
express	1
my	1
conviction	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
authorship	1
of	1
the	1
homeric	1
poems	1
to	1
deny	1
that	1
many	1
corruptions	1
and	1
interpolations	1
disfigure	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
intrusive	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
poetasters	1
may	1
here	1

there	1
have	1
inflicted	1
a	1
wound	1
more	1
serious	1
than	1
the	1
negligence	1
of	1
the	1
copyist	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
absurd	1
and	1
captious	1
assumption	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
a	1
higher	1
criticism	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
appeal	1
if	1
we	1
would	1
either	1
understand	1
or	1
enjoy	1
these	1
poems	1
in	1
maintaining	1
the	1
authenticity	1

i	1
feel	1
conscious	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
whole	1
weight	1
of	1
historical	1
evidence	1
is	1
against	1
the	1
hypothesis	1
which	1
would	1
assign	1
these	1
great	1
works	1
to	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
authors	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
internal	1
evidence	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
springs	1
from	1
the	1

immediate	1
impulse	1

minutiae	1
of	1

am	1
far	1
from	1
seeking	1
to	1
despise	1

considering	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
my	1

be	1

i	1
appreciate	1
its	1
importance	1
in	1
a	1
philological	1
view	1
i	1

inclined	1
to	1
set	1
little	1
store	1
on	1
its	1
aesthetic	1
value	1

in	1
poetry	1
three	1
parts	1

do	1
not	1
at	1
this	1

remember	1
two	1
emendations	1
on	1

calculated	1
to	1
substantially	1
improve	1
the	1
poetry	1
of	1
a	1
passage	1

a	1
mass	1
of	1
remarks	1
from	1
herodotus	1

must	1
express	1
my	1
fears	1
that	1

of	1

will	1
become	1

than	1

can	1

help	1
thinking	1
that	1
the	1

account	1
for	1

in	1

of	1
the	1

to	1
a	1
period	1
so	1
remote	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
creation	1
i	1
have	1
already	1
expressed	1
my	1
belief	1
that	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
peisistratus	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
purely	1
editorial	1
character	1
and	1
there	1
seems	1
no	1
more	1
reason	1
why	1
corrupt	1
and	1
imperfect	1
editions	1
of	1
homer	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
abroad	1
in	1
his	1
day	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
poems	1
of	1
valerius	1
flaccus	1
and	1
tibullus	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
so	1
much	1
trouble	1
to	1
poggio	1
scaliger	1
and	1
others	1
but	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
main	1
fault	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
homeric	1
theories	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
demand	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
those	1
feelings	1
to	1
which	1
poetry	1
most	1
powerfully	1
appeals	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
its	1
most	1
fitting	1
judges	1
the	1
ingenuity	1
which	1
has	1
sought	1
to	1
rob	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
and	1
existence	1
of	1
homer	1
does	1
too	1
much	1
violence	1
to	1
that	1
inward	1
emotion	1
which	1
makes	1
our	1
whole	1
soul	1
yearn	1
with	1
love	1
and	1
admiration	1
for	1
the	1
blind	1
bard	1
of	1
chios	1
to	1
believe	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
iliad	1
a	1
mere	1
compiler	1
is	1
to	1
degrade	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
human	1
invention	1
to	1
elevate	1
analytical	1
judgment	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
ennobling	1
impulses	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
ocean	1
in	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
a	1
polypus	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
catholicity	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
name	1
of	1
homer	1
our	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
iliad	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
mistaken	1
one	1
but	1
as	1
yet	1
nobody	1
has	1
taught	1
us	1
a	1
better	1
while	1
however	1
i	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
belief	1
in	1
homer	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
has	1
nature	1
herself	1
for	1
its	1
mainspring	1
while	1
i	1
can	1
join	1
with	1
old	1
ennius	1
in	1
believing	1
in	1
homer	1
as	1
the	1
ghost	1
who	1
like	1
some	1
patron	1
saint	1
hovers	1
round	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
and	1
even	1
bestows	1
rare	1
gifts	1
from	1
that	1
wealth	1
of	1
imagination	1
which	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
imitators	1
could	1
not	1
exhaust	1
â	1
still	1
i	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
wishing	1
to	1
deny	1
that	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
these	1
great	1
poems	1
found	1
a	1
rich	1
fund	1
of	1
tradition	1
a	1
well	1
stocked	1
mythical	1
storehouse	1
from	1
whence	1
pg	1
xxvii	1
he	1
might	1
derive	1
both	1
subject	1
and	1
embellishment	1

it	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
use	1
existing	1
romances	1
in	1
the	1
embellishment	1
of	1
a	1
poem	1
another	1
to	1
patch	1
up	1
the	1

itself	1
from	1
such	1
materials	1
what	1
consistency	1
of	1
style	1
and	1
execution	1
can	1
be	1
hoped	1
for	1
from	1
such	1
an	1
attempt	1
or	1
rather	1
what	1
bad	1
taste	1
and	1
tedium	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
infallible	1
result	1
a	1
blending	1
of	1
popular	1
legends	1
and	1
a	1
free	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1

features	1
perfectly	1
consistent	1
with	1
poetical	1
originality	1
in	1
fact	1
the	1
most	1
original	1
writer	1
is	1
still	1
drawing	1
upon	1
outward	1
impressionsâ	1
nay	1
even	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
are	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
secondary	1
agents	1

support	1

of	1
the	1

grounds	1
there	1

for	1
opposing	1
my	1
belief	1
it	1
still	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
homeric	1
question	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
reserved	1
for	1
a	1
higher	1
criticism	1
than	1
it	1
has	1
often	1
obtained	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
by	1
nature	1
intended	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
things	1
still	1
less	1
to	1
compass	1
the	1
powers	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
greatest	1
blessings	1
of	1
life	1
have	1
been	1
placed	1
at	1
our	1
disposal	1

we	1
might	1
indeed	1
wonder	1
why	1

willed	1
our	1
ignorance	1
on	1
any	1
matter	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
too	1
well	1
taught	1
the	1
contrary	1
lesson	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
though	1
our	1
faith	1
should	1
be	1
especially	1
tried	1
touching	1
the	1
men	1

the	1
events	1
which	1
have	1
wrought	1
most	1

upon	1
the	1

a	1
kind	1
of	1
sacredness	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
which	1
seems	1
to	1
bid	1
us	1
repulse	1
the	1
scepticism	1

would	1
allegorize	1
their	1
existence	1

upon	1

spots	1
which	1

analysis	1

of	1
the	1

even	1
if	1
no	1

the	1
history	1

every	1

of	1
many	1
in	1

almost	1
ascertained	1

in	1

much	1

that	1

would	1
attend	1
such	1
a	1
ridicule	1
of	1
war	1

the	1

is	1
contained	1

generally	1
that	1
the	1

is	1
a	1

ancient	1

account	1

i	1
will	1
now	1
proceed	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
few	1
remarks	1
on	1
his	1
translation	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
purpose	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
edition	1
pope	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
grecian	1
his	1
whole	1
education	1
had	1
been	1
irregular	1
and	1
his	1
earliest	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
poet	1
was	1
through	1
the	1
version	1
of	1
ogilby	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
work	1
bears	1
the	1
impress	1
of	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
sense	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
dive	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
minute	1
and	1
delicate	1
features	1
of	1
language	1
hence	1
his	1
whole	1
work	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
rather	1
as	1
an	1
elegant	1
paraphrase	1
than	1
a	1
translation	1
there	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
certain	1
conventional	1
anecdotes	1
which	1
prove	1
that	1
pope	1
consulted	1
various	1
friends	1
whose	1
classical	1
attainments	1
were	1
sounder	1
than	1
his	1
own	1
during	1
the	1
undertaking	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
these	1
examinations	1
were	1
the	1
result	1
rather	1
of	1
the	1
contradictory	1
versions	1
already	1
existing	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
perfect	1
transcript	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
and	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
literal	1
translation	1
was	1
less	1
cultivated	1
than	1
at	1
present	1
if	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
general	1
sense	1
could	1
be	1
decorated	1
with	1
the	1
easy	1
gracefulness	1
of	1
a	1
practised	1
poet	1
if	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
metrical	1
cadence	1
and	1
a	1
pleasing	1
fluency	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
consistent	1
with	1
a	1
fair	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
poetâ	1
s	1
meaning	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
less	1
jealously	1
sought	1
for	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
could	1
read	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
poem	1
as	1
popeâ	1
s	1
iliad	1
had	1
fair	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
absurd	1

much	1
a	1
part	1

we	1

from	1
our	1

associations	1

the	1

was	1

the	1

our	1

with	1
the	1

to	1

of	1
homer	1
homer	1
is	1
universally	1
allowed	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
greatest	1
invention	1
of	1
any	1
writer	1
whatever	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
judgment	1
virgil	1
has	1
justly	1
contested	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
others	1
may	1
have	1
their	1
pretensions	1
as	1
to	1
particular	1
excellences	1
but	1
his	1
invention	1
remains	1
yet	1
unrivalled	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
wonder	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
acknowledged	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
poets	1
who	1
most	1
excelled	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
foundation	1
of	1
poetry	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
invention	1
that	1
in	1
different	1
degrees	1
distinguishes	1
all	1
great	1
geniuses	1
the	1
utmost	1
stretch	1
of	1
human	1
study	1
learning	1
and	1
industry	1
which	1
masters	1
everything	1
besides	1
can	1
never	1
attain	1
to	1
this	1
it	1
furnishes	1
art	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
materials	1

without	1
it	1

itself	1

at	1

but	1
â	1

wisely	1
â	1
for	1

is	1
only	1
like	1

on	1
managing	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
nature	1
whatever	1
praises	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
works	1
of	1
judgment	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
single	1
beauty	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
invention	1
must	1
not	1
contribute	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
regular	1
gardens	1
art	1
can	1
only	1
reduce	1
beauties	1
of	1
nature	1
to	1
more	1
regularity	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
figure	1
which	1
the	1
common	1
eye	1
may	1
better	1
take	1
in	1
and	1
is	1
therefore	1
more	1
entertained	1
with	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
common	1
critics	1
are	1
inclined	1
to	1
prefer	1
a	1
judicious	1
and	1
methodical	1
genius	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
fruitful	1
one	1
is	1
because	1
they	1
find	1
it	1
easier	1
for	1
themselves	1
to	1
pursue	1
their	1
observations	1
through	1
a	1
uniform	1
and	1
bounded	1
walk	1
of	1
art	1
than	1
to	1
comprehend	1
the	1
vast	1
and	1
various	1
extent	1
of	1
nature	1
our	1
authorâ	1
s	1
work	1
is	1
a	1
wild	1
paradise	1
where	1
if	1
we	1
cannot	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
beauties	1
so	1
distinctly	1
as	1
in	1
an	1
ordered	1
garden	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
infinitely	1
greater	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
copious	1
nursery	1
which	1
contains	1
the	1
seeds	1
and	1
first	1
productions	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
those	1
who	1
followed	1
him	1
have	1
but	1
selected	1
some	1
particular	1
plants	1
each	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
fancy	1
to	1
cultivate	1
and	1
beautify	1
if	1
some	1
things	1
are	1
too	1
luxuriant	1
it	1
is	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
richness	1
of	1
the	1
soil	1
and	1
if	1
others	1
are	1
not	1
arrived	1
to	1
perfection	1
or	1
maturity	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
overrun	1
and	1
oppressed	1
by	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
stronger	1
nature	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
this	1
amazing	1
invention	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
attribute	1
that	1
unequalled	1
fire	1
and	1
rapture	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
forcible	1
in	1
homer	1
that	1
no	1
man	1

spirit	1

master	1
of	1

became	1

reasonable	1
in	1
the	1

to	1

it	1
aside	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1

perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
unhappy	1
circumstance	1
for	1
virgil	1
that	1
there	1

and	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
makes	1
its	1
greatest	1
importance	1
and	1
dignity	1
for	1
we	1
find	1
those	1
authors	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
offended	1
at	1
the	1

even	1
in	1
the	1

excelled	1
what	1

sufficient	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

in	1

is	1
that	1

a	1
parity	1
with	1
those	1
of	1

this	1

it	1
is	1
with	1
justice	1
an	1
excellent	1

allows	1
that	1

vulgar	1
he	1

noble	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
roman	1
author	1
seldom	1
rises	1
into	1
very	1

sentiments	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
fired	1
by	1
the	1

if	1
we	1
observe	1
his	1
descriptions	1

we	1
shall	1
find	1
the	1
invention	1
still	1
predominant	1
to	1
what	1
else	1
can	1
we	1
ascribe	1
that	1
vast	1
comprehension	1
of	1
images	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
where	1
we	1
see	1
each	1
circumstance	1
of	1
art	1
and	1
individual	1
of	1
nature	1
summoned	1
together	1
by	1
the	1
extent	1

fecundity	1
of	1
his	1
imagination	1
to	1
which	1
all	1

in	1
their	1

taken	1
off	1
to	1
perfection	1
at	1

several	1

homer	1
nothing	1
is	1
so	1
surprising	1
as	1
the	1

of	1
his	1
battles	1
which	1
take	1
up	1
no	1
less	1

half	1

such	1
a	1

that	1

rises	1
above	1
the	1

with	1

great	1
quantity	1
out	1
of	1

it	1
is	1
evident	1
of	1

that	1
he	1
has	1
scarce	1
any	1
comparisons	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
drawn	1
from	1
his	1
master	1
if	1
we	1

from	1
hence	1
to	1
the	1

we	1
see	1
the	1
bright	1
imagination	1
of	1
homer	1
shining	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
enlivened	1
forms	1
of	1
it	1
we	1
acknowledge	1
him	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
poetical	1
diction	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
taught	1
that	1
â	1
œlanguage	1
of	1
the	1

to	1
men	1
his	1
expression	1
is	1
like	1
pg	1

the	1
colouring	1
of	1
some	1
great	1
masters	1
which	1
discovers	1
itself	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
boldly	1
and	1
executed	1
with	1
rapidity	1
it	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
strongest	1
and	1
most	1
glowing	1
imaginable	1
and	1
touched	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
spirit	1
aristotle	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
poet	1
who	1
had	1
found	1
out	1
â	1
œliving	1

more	1

the	1

of	1
an	1

and	1
the	1
like	1
yet	1
his	1
expression	1
is	1
never	1
too	1
big	1
for	1
the	1
sense	1
but	1
justly	1
great	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
sentiment	1
that	1
swells	1
and	1
fills	1
out	1
the	1
diction	1
which	1
rises	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
forms	1
itself	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
degree	1
that	1
a	1

be	1

as	1
that	1
is	1

this	1
will	1
become	1
more	1
perspicuous	1
like	1

in	1
the	1

which	1
grows	1
to	1
a	1
greater	1
magnitude	1
and	1
refines	1
to	1
a	1
greater	1
clearness	1
only	1
as	1
the	1
breath	1
within	1
is	1
more	1
powerful	1
and	1
the	1
heat	1
more	1
intense	1
to	1
throw	1
his	1
language	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
prose	1
homer	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
affected	1
the	1
compound	1
epithets	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
composition	1
peculiarly	1
proper	1
to	1
poetry	1
not	1
only	1
as	1
it	1
heightened	1
the	1
diction	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
assisted	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
numbers	1
with	1
greater	1
sound	1
and	1
pomp	1
and	1
likewise	1
conduced	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
to	1
thicken	1
the	1
images	1
on	1
this	1
last	1
consideration	1
i	1
cannot	1
but	1
attribute	1
these	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
fruitfulness	1
of	1
his	1
invention	1
since	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
managed	1
them	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
supernumerary	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
or	1
things	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
hectorâ	1
s	1
plumes	1
in	1
the	1
epithet	1
korythaiolos	1
the	1
landscape	1
of	1
mount	1
neritus	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
einosiphyllos	1
and	1
so	1
of	1
others	1
which	1
particular	1
images	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
insisted	1
upon	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
to	1
express	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
description	1
though	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
line	1
without	1
diverting	1
the	1
reader	1
too	1
much	1
from	1
the	1
principal	1
action	1
or	1
figure	1
as	1
a	1
metaphor	1
is	1
a	1
short	1
simile	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
epithets	1
is	1
a	1
short	1
description	1
lastly	1
if	1
we	1
consider	1
his	1
versification	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
sensible	1
what	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
praise	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
invention	1
in	1
that	1
also	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
language	1
as	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
settled	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
greece	1
but	1
searched	1
through	1
its	1
different	1
dialects	1
with	1
this	1
particular	1
view	1
to	1
beautify	1
and	1
perfect	1
his	1
numbers	1
he	1
considered	1
these	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
greater	1
mixture	1
of	1
vowels	1
or	1
consonants	1
and	1
accordingly	1
employed	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
verse	1
required	1
either	1
a	1
greater	1
smoothness	1
or	1
strength	1
what	1
he	1
most	1
affected	1
was	1
the	1
ionic	1
which	1
has	1
a	1
peculiar	1
sweetness	1
from	1
its	1
never	1
using	1
contractions	1
and	1
from	1
its	1
custom	1
of	1
resolving	1
the	1
diphthongs	1
into	1
two	1
syllables	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
words	1
open	1
themselves	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
spreading	1
and	1
sonorous	1
fluency	1
with	1
this	1
he	1
mingled	1
the	1
attic	1
contractions	1
the	1
broader	1
doric	1
and	1
the	1
feebler	1
ã	1
olic	1
which	1
often	1
rejects	1
its	1
aspirate	1
or	1
takes	1
off	1
its	1
accent	1
and	1
completed	1
this	1
variety	1
by	1
altering	1
some	1
letters	1
with	1
the	1
licence	1
of	1
poetry	1
thus	1
his	1
measures	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
fetters	1
to	1
his	1
sense	1
were	1
always	1
in	1
readiness	1
to	1
run	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
his	1
rapture	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
further	1
representation	1
of	1
his	1
notions	1
in	1
the	1
correspondence	1
of	1
their	1
sounds	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
signified	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
he	1
has	1
derived	1
that	1
harmony	1
which	1
makes	1
us	1
confess	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
richest	1
head	1
but	1
the	1
finest	1
ear	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
this	1
is	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
truth	1
that	1
whoever	1
will	1
but	1
pg	1
xxxvii	1
consult	1
the	1
tune	1
of	1
his	1
verses	1
even	1
without	1
understanding	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
diligence	1
as	1
we	1
daily	1
see	1
practised	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
italian	1
operas	1
will	1
find	1
more	1
sweetness	1
variety	1
and	1
majesty	1
of	1
sound	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
language	1
of	1
poetry	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
his	1
numbers	1
is	1
allowed	1
by	1
the	1
critics	1
to	1
be	1
copied	1
but	1
faintly	1
by	1
virgil	1
himself	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
just	1
as	1
to	1
ascribe	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
latin	1
tongue	1
indeed	1
the	1
greek	1
has	1
some	1
advantages	1
both	1
from	1
the	1
natural	1
sound	1
of	1
its	1
words	1
and	1
the	1
turn	1
and	1
cadence	1
of	1
its	1
verse	1
which	1
agree	1
with	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
no	1
other	1
language	1
virgil	1
was	1
very	1
sensible	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
used	1
the	1
utmost	1
diligence	1
in	1
working	1
up	1
a	1
more	1
intractable	1
language	1
to	1
whatsoever	1
graces	1
it	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
line	1
to	1
a	1
beautiful	1
agreement	1
with	1
its	1
sense	1
if	1
the	1
grecian	1
poet	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
frequently	1
celebrated	1
on	1
this	1
account	1
as	1
the	1
roman	1
the	1
only	1
reason	1
is	1
that	1
fewer	1
critics	1
have	1
understood	1
one	1
language	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
dionysius	1
of	1
halicarnassus	1
has	1
pointed	1
out	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
authorâ	1

beauties	1
in	1
this	1
kind	1
in	1
his	1
treatise	1
of	1
the	1
composition	1
of	1
words	1
it	1
suffices	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
observe	1
of	1
his	1
numbers	1
that	1
they	1
flow	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
ease	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
imagine	1
homer	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
care	1
than	1
to	1
transcribe	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
muses	1
dictated	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
force	1
and	1
inspiriting	1
vigour	1
that	1
they	1
awaken	1
and	1
raise	1
us	1
like	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet	1
they	1
roll	1
along	1
as	1
a	1
plentiful	1
river	1
always	1
in	1
motion	1
and	1
always	1
full	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
a	1
tide	1
of	1
verse	1
the	1
most	1
rapid	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
most	1
smooth	1
imaginable	1
thus	1
on	1
whatever	1
side	1
we	1
contemplate	1
homer	1
what	1
principally	1
strikes	1
us	1
is	1
his	1
invention	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
forms	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
each	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
accordingly	1
we	1
find	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
his	1
fable	1
more	1
extensive	1
and	1

with	1

with	1
a	1

virgil	1
like	1

constant	1
stream	1
when	1
we	1
behold	1
their	1

methinks	1
the	1
two	1
poets	1
resemble	1
the	1

they	1
celebrate	1

conquers	1
with	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
look	1
upon	1
their	1
machines	1
homer	1
seems	1
like	1
his	1
own	1
jupiter	1
in	1
his	1
terrors	1
shaking	1
olympus	1
scattering	1
the	1
lightnings	1
and	1
firing	1
the	1

virgil	1
like	1
the	1

power	1
in	1
his	1
benevolence	1
counselling	1
with	1
the	1
gods	1
laying	1
plans	1
for	1
empires	1
and	1
regularly	1
ordering	1
his	1
whole	1
creation	1
but	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
great	1
parts	1
as	1
with	1
great	1
virtues	1
they	1
naturally	1
border	1
on	1
some	1
imperfection	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
hard	1
to	1
distinguish	1
exactly	1
where	1
the	1
virtue	1
ends	1
or	1
the	1
fault	1
begins	1
as	1
prudence	1
may	1
sometimes	1
sink	1
to	1
suspicion	1
so	1
may	1
a	1
great	1
judgment	1
decline	1
to	1
coldness	1
and	1
as	1
magnanimity	1
may	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
profusion	1
or	1
extravagance	1
so	1
may	1
a	1
great	1
invention	1
to	1
redundancy	1
or	1
wildness	1
if	1
we	1
look	1
upon	1
homer	1
in	1
this	1
view	1
we	1
shall	1
perceive	1
the	1
chief	1
objections	1
against	1
him	1
to	1
proceed	1
from	1
so	1
noble	1
a	1
cause	1
as	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
this	1
faculty	1
among	1
these	1
we	1
may	1
reckon	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
marvellous	1
fictions	1
upon	1
which	1
so	1
much	1
criticism	1
has	1
been	1
spent	1
as	1
surpassing	1
all	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
probability	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
great	1
and	1
superior	1
souls	1
as	1
with	1
gigantic	1
bodies	1
which	1
exerting	1
themselves	1
with	1
unusual	1
strength	1
exceed	1
what	1
is	1
commonly	1
thought	1
the	1
due	1
proportion	1
of	1
parts	1
to	1
become	1
miracles	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
old	1
heroes	1
of	1
that	1
make	1
commit	1
something	1
near	1
extravagance	1
amidst	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
glorious	1
and	1
inimitable	1
performances	1

the	1

has	1
not	1
so	1

contrived	1
the	1
easy	1
intervention	1
of	1
a	1
deity	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
probability	1
it	1
is	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
vast	1
invention	1
that	1
his	1
similes	1
have	1
been	1
thought	1
too	1
exuberant	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
circumstances	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
this	1
faculty	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
its	1
inability	1
to	1
confine	1
itself	1
to	1
that	1
single	1
circumstance	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
comparison	1
is	1
grounded	1
it	1
runs	1
out	1
into	1
embellishments	1
of	1
additional	1
images	1
which	1
however	1
are	1
so	1
managed	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
overpower	1
the	1
main	1
one	1
his	1
similes	1
are	1
like	1
pictures	1
where	1
the	1
principal	1
figure	1
has	1
not	1
only	1
its	1
proportion	1
given	1
agreeable	1
to	1
the	1
original	1
but	1
is	1
also	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
occasional	1
ornaments	1
and	1
prospects	1
the	1
same	1
will	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
heaping	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
comparisons	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
breath	1
when	1
his	1
fancy	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
so	1
many	1
various	1
and	1
correspondent	1
images	1
the	1
reader	1
will	1
easily	1
extend	1
this	1
observation	1
to	1
more	1
objections	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
which	1
seem	1
rather	1
to	1
charge	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
defect	1

narrowness	1
of	1
genius	1

an	1
excess	1
of	1
it	1
those	1

defects	1

be	1
found	1
upon	1
examination	1
to	1
proceed	1
wholly	1
from	1

by	1

at	1
the	1

employments	1
in	1
which	1

view	1
of	1

drawing	1
water	1
from	1

we	1
ought	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
reading	1
the	1
most	1
ancient	1
author	1
in	1
the	1
heathen	1
world	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
consider	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
light	1
will	1
double	1
their	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
perusal	1
of	1
him	1
let	1
them	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
growing	1
acquainted	1
with	1
nations	1
and	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
now	1
no	1

they	1
are	1
stepping	1
almost	1
three	1
thousand	1
years	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
remotest	1
antiquity	1
and	1
entertaining	1
themselves	1
with	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
surprising	1
vision	1
of	1
things	1
nowhere	1
else	1
to	1
be	1

true	1
mirror	1
of	1

their	1

vanish	1

what	1

further	1

the	1

this	1

indeed	1

excels	1
all	1

this	1

it	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
grand	1
duty	1
of	1
an	1
interpreter	1
to	1
give	1
his	1

entire	1
and	1
unmaimed	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
the	1
diction	1
and	1
versification	1
only	1
are	1
his	1
proper	1
province	1
since	1
these	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
own	1

the	1
others	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
as	1
he	1
finds	1
them	1
it	1
should	1
then	1
be	1
considered	1
what	1
methods	1
may	1
afford	1
some	1
equivalent	1
in	1
our	1
language	1
for	1
the	1
graces	1
of	1
these	1
in	1
the	1
greek	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
no	1
literal	1
translation	1
can	1
be	1
just	1
to	1
an	1
excellent	1
original	1
in	1
a	1
superior	1

but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
mistake	1
to	1
imagine	1
as	1
many	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
a	1
rash	1
paraphrase	1
can	1
make	1
amends	1
for	1
this	1
general	1
defect	1
which	1
is	1
no	1
less	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
lose	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
ancient	1
by	1
deviating	1
into	1
the	1
modern	1
manners	1
of	1
expression	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
sometimes	1
a	1
darkness	1
there	1
is	1
often	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
antiquity	1
which	1
nothing	1
better	1
preserves	1
than	1
a	1
version	1
almost	1
literal	1
i	1
know	1
no	1
liberties	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
take	1
but	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
necessary	1
to	1
transfusing	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
and	1
supporting	1
the	1
poetical	1
style	1
of	1
the	1
translation	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
there	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
more	1
men	1
misled	1
in	1
former	1
times	1
by	1
a	1
servile	1
dull	1
adherence	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
than	1
have	1
been	1
deluded	1
in	1
ours	1
by	1
a	1
chimerical	1
insolent	1
hope	1
of	1
raising	1
and	1
improving	1
their	1
author	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
poem	1
is	1
what	1
a	1
translator	1
should	1
principally	1
regard	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
expire	1
in	1
his	1
managing	1
however	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
safest	1
way	1
to	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
preserving	1
this	1
to	1
his	1
utmost	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
without	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
finds	1
his	1

in	1
any	1
particular	1
place	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
secret	1
in	1
writing	1
to	1
know	1
when	1
to	1
be	1
plain	1
and	1
when	1
poetical	1
and	1
figurative	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
homer	1
will	1
teach	1
us	1
if	1
we	1
will	1
but	1
follow	1
modestly	1
in	1
his	1
footsteps	1
where	1
his	1
diction	1
is	1
bold	1
and	1
lofty	1
let	1
us	1
raise	1
ours	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
but	1
where	1
his	1
is	1
plain	1
and	1
humble	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
deterred	1
from	1
imitating	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
incurring	1
the	1
censure	1
of	1
a	1
mere	1
english	1
critic	1
nothing	1
that	1
belongs	1
to	1
homer	1

xlii	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
commonly	1
mistaken	1
than	1
the	1
just	1
pitch	1
of	1
his	1
style	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
translators	1
having	1
swelled	1
into	1
fustian	1
in	1
a	1
proud	1
confidence	1
of	1

sunk	1
into	1

in	1
a	1
cold	1
and	1
timorous	1
notion	1
of	1

i	1

these	1

followers	1
of	1

and	1
straining	1
after	1
him	1
by	1
violent	1
leaps	1

for	1
such	1
commendations	1

by	1

character	1
of	1

must	1
agree	1

a	1
graceful	1
and	1
dignified	1
simplicity	1

well	1
as	1
a	1
bold	1
and	1
sordid	1
one	1
which	1
differ	1
as	1
much	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
plain	1
man	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
sloven	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1

be	1
tricked	1
up	1
and	1
another	1
not	1

at	1

the	1
mean	1
between	1
ostentation	1
and	1
rusticity	1
this	1
pure	1
and	1
noble	1
simplicity	1
is	1
nowhere	1
in	1
such	1
perfection	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
scripture	1
and	1
our	1
author	1
one	1
may	1
affirm	1
with	1
all	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
inspired	1
writings	1
that	1
the	1
divine	1
spirit	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
no	1
other	1
words	1
but	1
what	1
were	1
intelligible	1
and	1
common	1
to	1
men	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
as	1
homer	1
is	1
the	1
author	1
nearest	1
to	1
those	1
his	1
style	1
must	1
of	1
course	1
bear	1
a	1
greater	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
sacred	1
books	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
writer	1
this	1
consideration	1
together	1
with	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
observed	1
of	1
the	1
parity	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
may	1
methinks	1
induce	1
a	1
translator	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
to	1
give	1
in	1
to	1
several	1
of	1
those	1
general	1
phrases	1
and	1
manners	1
of	1
expression	1
which	1
have	1
attained	1
a	1
veneration	1
even	1
in	1
our	1
language	1
from	1
being	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
testament	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
avoid	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
appropriated	1
to	1
the	1
divinity	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
consigned	1
to	1
mystery	1
and	1
religion	1
for	1
a	1
further	1
preservation	1
of	1
this	1
air	1
of	1
simplicity	1
a	1
particular	1
care	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
express	1
with	1
all	1
plainness	1
those	1
moral	1
sentences	1
and	1
proverbial	1
speeches	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
numerous	1
in	1
this	1
poet	1
they	1
have	1
something	1
venerable	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
may	1
say	1
oracular	1
in	1
that	1
unadorned	1
gravity	1
and	1
shortness	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
delivered	1
a	1
grace	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
utterly	1
lost	1
by	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
a	1
more	1
ingenious	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
more	1
modern	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
paraphrase	1
perhaps	1
the	1
mixture	1
of	1
some	1
graecisms	1
and	1
old	1
words	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
milton	1
if	1
done	1
without	1
too	1
much	1
affectation	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
an	1
ill	1
effect	1
in	1
a	1
version	1
of	1
this	1
particular	1
work	1
which	1
most	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
seems	1
to	1
require	1
a	1
venerable	1
antique	1
cast	1
but	1
certainly	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
modern	1
terms	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
government	1
such	1
as	1
â	1
œplatoon	1
campaign	1
junto	1
â	1
or	1
the	1
like	1
into	1
which	1
some	1
of	1

be	1
allowable	1
those	1

which	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
treat	1
the	1

in	1
any	1
living	1
language	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
peculiarities	1
in	1
homerâ	1

which	1
are	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
marks	1

moles	1
by	1
which	1
every	1

distinguishes	1
him	1
at	1

those	1
who	1

upon	1

those	1

of	1
his	1

many	1
of	1

be	1
done	1
literally	1
into	1

destroying	1
the	1

of	1

repetition	1
of	1
the	1

epithets	1

we	1

in	1
homer	1

which	1

one	1
may	1
wait	1
for	1
opportunities	1

they	1
derive	1
an	1
additional	1
beauty	1
from	1

which	1
they	1

in	1

this	1
properly	1
a	1
translator	1
may	1
at	1
once	1
show	1
his	1
fancy	1
and	1
his	1
judgment	1
as	1
for	1
homerâ	1
s	1
repetitions	1
we	1
may	1
divide	1
them	1
into	1
three	1
sorts	1
of	1
whole	1
narrations	1
and	1
speeches	1
of	1
single	1
sentences	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
verse	1
or	1
hemistitch	1
i	1
hope	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
impossible	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
regard	1
to	1
these	1
as	1
neither	1
to	1
lose	1
so	1
known	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
author	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
nor	1
to	1
offend	1
the	1
reader	1
too	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
repetition	1
is	1
not	1
ungraceful	1
in	1
those	1
speeches	1
where	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
the	1
speaker	1
renders	1
it	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
insolence	1
to	1
alter	1
his	1
words	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
messages	1
from	1
gods	1
to	1
men	1
or	1
from	1
higher	1
powers	1
to	1
inferiors	1
in	1
concerns	1
of	1
state	1
or	1
where	1
the	1
ceremonial	1
of	1
religion	1
seems	1
to	1
require	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
solemn	1
forms	1
of	1
prayers	1
oaths	1
or	1
the	1
like	1
in	1
other	1
cases	1
i	1
believe	1
the	1
best	1
rule	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
the	1
nearness	1
or	1
distance	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
repetitions	1
are	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
original	1
when	1
they	1
follow	1
too	1
close	1
one	1
may	1
vary	1
the	1
expression	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
whether	1
a	1
professed	1
translator	1
be	1
authorized	1
to	1
omit	1
any	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
tedious	1
the	1
author	1
is	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
it	1
only	1
remains	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
versification	1
homer	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
is	1
perpetually	1
applying	1
the	1
sound	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
and	1
varying	1
it	1
on	1
every	1
new	1
subject	1
this	1
is	1
indeed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
exquisite	1
beauties	1
of	1
poetry	1
and	1
attainable	1
by	1
very	1
few	1
i	1
only	1
know	1
of	1
homer	1
eminent	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
greek	1
and	1
virgil	1
in	1
the	1
latin	1
i	1
am	1
sensible	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
may	1
sometimes	1
happen	1
by	1
chance	1
when	1
a	1
writer	1
is	1
warm	1
and	1
fully	1
pg	1
xliv	1
possessed	1
of	1
his	1
image	1
however	1
it	1
may	1
reasonably	1
be	1
believed	1
they	1
designed	1
this	1
in	1
whose	1
verse	1
it	1
so	1
manifestly	1
appears	1
in	1
a	1
superior	1
degree	1
to	1
all	1
others	1
few	1
readers	1
have	1
the	1
ear	1
to	1
be	1
judges	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
will	1
see	1
i	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
at	1
this	1
beauty	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
i	1
must	1
confess	1
myself	1
utterly	1
incapable	1
of	1
doing	1
justice	1
to	1
homer	1
i	1
attempt	1
him	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
hope	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
one	1
may	1
entertain	1
without	1
much	1
vanity	1
of	1
giving	1
a	1
more	1
tolerable	1
copy	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
any	1
entire	1
translation	1
in	1
verse	1
has	1
yet	1
done	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
those	1
of	1
chapman	1
hobbes	1
and	1
ogilby	1
chapman	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
an	1
immeasurable	1
length	1
of	1
verse	1
notwithstanding	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
scarce	1
any	1
paraphrase	1
more	1
loose	1
and	1
rambling	1
than	1
his	1
he	1
has	1
frequent	1
interpolations	1
of	1
four	1
or	1
six	1
lines	1
and	1
i	1
remember	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
odyssey	1
ver	1
312	1
where	1
he	1
has	1
spun	1
twenty	1
verses	1
out	1
of	1
two	1
he	1
is	1
often	1
mistaken	1
in	1
so	1
bold	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
one	1
might	1
think	1
he	1
deviated	1
on	1
purpose	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
other	1
places	1
of	1
his	1
notes	1
insist	1
so	1
much	1
upon	1
verbal	1
trifles	1
he	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
strong	1
affectation	1
of	1
extracting	1
new	1
meanings	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
author	1
insomuch	1
as	1
to	1
promise	1
in	1
his	1
rhyming	1
preface	1
a	1
poem	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
he	1
had	1
revealed	1
in	1
homer	1
and	1
perhaps	1
he	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
strain	1
the	1
obvious	1
sense	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
his	1
expression	1
is	1
involved	1
in	1
fustian	1
a	1
fault	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
remarkable	1
in	1
his	1
original	1
writings	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
tragedy	1
of	1
bussy	1
dâ	1
amboise	1
c	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
may	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
whole	1
performance	1
for	1
he	1
appears	1
from	1
his	1
preface	1
and	1
remarks	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
an	1
arrogant	1
turn	1
and	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
in	1
poetry	1
his	1
own	1
boast	1
of	1
having	1
finished	1
half	1
the	1
iliad	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
fifteen	1
weeks	1
shows	1
with	1
what	1
negligence	1
his	1
version	1
was	1
performed	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
him	1
and	1
which	1
very	1
much	1
contributed	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
defects	1
is	1
a	1
daring	1
fiery	1
spirit	1
that	1
animates	1
his	1
translation	1
which	1
is	1
something	1
like	1
what	1
one	1
might	1
imagine	1
homer	1
himself	1
would	1
have	1
writ	1
before	1
he	1
arrived	1
at	1
years	1
of	1
discretion	1
hobbes	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
a	1
correct	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
sense	1
in	1
general	1
but	1
for	1
particulars	1
and	1
circumstances	1
he	1
continually	1
lops	1
them	1
and	1
often	1
omits	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
as	1
for	1
its	1
being	1
esteemed	1
a	1
close	1
translation	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
many	1
have	1
been	1
led	1
into	1
that	1
error	1
by	1
the	1
shortness	1
of	1
it	1
which	1
proceeds	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
following	1
the	1
original	1
line	1
by	1
line	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
contractions	1
above	1
mentioned	1
he	1
sometimes	1
omits	1
whole	1
similes	1
and	1
sentences	1
and	1
is	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
guilty	1
of	1
mistakes	1
into	1
which	1
no	1
writer	1
of	1
his	1
learning	1
could	1
have	1
fallen	1
but	1
through	1
carelessness	1
his	1
poetry	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
ogilbyâ	1
s	1
is	1
too	1
mean	1
for	1
criticism	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
to	1
the	1
poetical	1
world	1
that	1
mr	1
dryden	1
did	1
not	1
live	1
to	1
translate	1
the	1
iliad	1
he	1
has	1
left	1
us	1
only	1
the	1
first	1
book	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sixth	1
in	1
which	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
in	1
some	1
places	1
not	1
truly	1
interpreted	1
the	1
sense	1
or	1
preserved	1
the	1
antiquities	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
excused	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
haste	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
write	1
in	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
regard	1
to	1
chapman	1
whose	1
words	1
he	1
sometimes	1
copies	1
and	1
has	1
unhappily	1
followed	1
him	1
in	1
passages	1
where	1
he	1
wanders	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
however	1
had	1
he	1
translated	1
the	1
whole	1
work	1
i	1
would	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
attempted	1
homer	1
after	1
him	1
than	1
virgil	1
his	1
version	1
of	1
whom	1
notwithstanding	1
some	1
human	1
errors	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
noble	1
and	1
spirited	1
translation	1
i	1
know	1
in	1
any	1
language	1
but	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
great	1
geniuses	1
is	1
like	1
pg	1
xlv	1
that	1
of	1
great	1
ministers	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
confessedly	1
the	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
commonwealth	1
of	1
letters	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
envied	1
and	1
calumniated	1
only	1
for	1
being	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
which	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
endeavour	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
who	1
translates	1
homer	1
is	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
keep	1
alive	1
that	1
spirit	1
and	1
fire	1
which	1
makes	1
his	1
chief	1
character	1
in	1
particular	1
places	1
where	1
the	1
sense	1
can	1
bear	1
any	1
doubt	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
strongest	1
and	1
most	1
poetical	1
as	1
most	1
agreeing	1
with	1
that	1
character	1
to	1
copy	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
variations	1
of	1
his	1
style	1
and	1
the	1
different	1
modulations	1
of	1
his	1
numbers	1
to	1
preserve	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
active	1
or	1
descriptive	1
parts	1
a	1
warmth	1
and	1
elevation	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
sedate	1
or	1
narrative	1
a	1
plainness	1
and	1
solemnity	1
in	1
the	1
speeches	1
a	1
fulness	1
and	1
perspicuity	1
in	1
the	1
sentences	1
a	1
shortness	1
and	1
gravity	1
not	1
to	1
neglect	1
even	1
the	1
little	1
figures	1

turns	1
on	1
the	1
words	1

sometimes	1
the	1
very	1
cast	1
of	1

to	1
omit	1
nor	1
confound	1
any	1
rites	1

customs	1
of	1
antiquity	1
perhaps	1
too	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
include	1
the	1
whole	1

a	1
shorter	1

than	1
has	1
hitherto	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
any	1

has	1
tolerably	1
preserved	1

the	1

i	1
would	1
further	1
recommend	1
to	1

to	1
