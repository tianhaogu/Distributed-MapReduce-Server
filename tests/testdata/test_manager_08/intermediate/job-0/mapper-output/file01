on	1

as	1

buried	1
his	1
face	1
in	1

all	1
at	1

he	1
jumped	1
up	1
sat	1
up	1
on	1

opened	1
his	1

yes	1
yes	1

twinkled	1
gaily	1
and	1
he	1
pondered	1
with	1
a	1

yes	1
it	1

nice	1
very	1
nice	1
there	1
was	1
a	1

even	1

a	1
gleam	1
of	1
light	1
peeping	1
in	1
beside	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
serge	1
curtains	1
he	1
cheerfully	1
dropped	1
his	1
feet	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
felt	1
about	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
his	1
slippers	1
a	1
present	1
on	1
his	1
last	1
birthday	1
worked	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
on	1
gold	1
colored	1
morocco	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
nine	1
years	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
without	1
getting	1
up	1
towards	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
always	1
hung	1
in	1
his	1
bedroom	1
and	1
thereupon	1
he	1
suddenly	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
sleeping	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
room	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
why	1
the	1
smile	1
vanished	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
knitted	1
his	1
brows	1
ah	1
ah	1
ah	1
oo	1
he	1
muttered	1
recalling	1
everything	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
again	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
quarrel	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
present	1
to	1
his	1
imagination	1
all	1
the	1
hopelessness	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
fault	1
yes	1
she	1
won	1
t	1
forgive	1
me	1
and	1
she	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
awful	1
thing	1
about	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
my	1
fault	1
all	1
my	1
fault	1

m	1
not	1

that	1
s	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
situation	1

reflected	1
oh	1
oh	1
oh	1
he	1
kept	1
repeating	1
in	1
despair	1
as	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
acutely	1
painful	1
sensations	1
caused	1
him	1
by	1
this	1
quarrel	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
when	1
on	1
coming	1
happy	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
from	1
the	1
theater	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
pear	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
either	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
her	1
bedroom	1
with	1
the	1
unlucky	1
letter	1
that	1
revealed	1
everything	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
she	1
his	1
dolly	1
forever	1
fussing	1
and	1
worrying	1
over	1
household	1
details	1
and	1
limited	1
in	1
her	1
ideas	1
as	1
he	1
considered	1
was	1
sitting	1
perfectly	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
horror	1

and	1
indignation	1
what	1

arkadyevitch	1

unexpectedly	1
caught	1
in	1
something	1
very	1
disgraceful	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
adapting	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
placed	1
towards	1
his	1
wife	1
by	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
his	1
fault	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1

denying	1

of	1
remaining	1

arkadyevitch	1
was	1
a	1

man	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
himself	1
he	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
deceiving	1
himself	1
and	1
persuading	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
repented	1
of	1
his	1
conduct	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
this	1

repent	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
a	1
handsome	1
susceptible	1
man	1
of	1
thirty	1
four	1
was	1
not	1
in	1

with	1

only	1

he	1

of	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
succeeded	1
better	1
in	1
hiding	1

from	1

he	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
his	1
children	1
and	1
himself	1
possibly	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
managed	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
sins	1
better	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
anticipated	1
that	1
the	1
knowledge	1

would	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
effect	1
on	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
clearly	1
thought	1
out	1
the	1
subject	1

he	1
had	1
vaguely	1
conceived	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
must	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
suspected	1
him	1
of	1
being	1
unfaithful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
shut	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
kept	1
repeating	1
to	1
himself	1

he	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1

how	1

were	1
going	1
up	1

never	1

in	1
anything	1
i	1
let	1
her	1
manage	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
liked	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
it	1
s	1
bad	1
her	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
governess	1
in	1
our	1
house	1
that	1
s	1
bad	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
common	1
vulgar	1
in	1
flirting	1
with	1
one	1
s	1
governess	1
but	1
what	1
a	1
governess	1
he	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
the	1
roguish	1
black	1
eyes	1
of	1
mlle	1
roland	1
and	1
her	1
smile	1
but	1
after	1
all	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
i	1
kept	1
myself	1
in	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
s	1
already	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
if	1
ill	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
so	1
oh	1
oh	1
but	1
what	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
solution	1
but	1
that	1
universal	1
solution	1
which	1
life	1
gives	1
to	1
all	1
questions	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
complex	1
and	1
insoluble	1
that	1
answer	1
is	1
one	1
must	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
needs	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
is	1
forget	1
oneself	1
to	1
forget	1
himself	1
in	1
sleep	1
was	1
impossible	1
now	1
at	1
least	1
till	1
nighttime	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
music	1
sung	1
by	1
the	1
decanter	1
women	1
so	1
he	1
must	1
forget	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
dream	1
of	1
daily	1
life	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
gray	1
dressing	1
gown	1
lined	1
with	1
blue	1
silk	1
tied	1
the	1
tassels	1
in	1
a	1
knot	1
and	1
drawing	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
of	1
air	1
into	1
his	1
broad	1
bare	1
chest	1
he	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
confident	1
step	1
turning	1
out	1
his	1
feet	1
that	1
carried	1
his	1
full	1
frame	1
so	1
easily	1
he	1
pulled	1
up	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
loudly	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
answered	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
his	1
valet	1
matvey	1
carrying	1
his	1
clothes	1
his	1
boots	1
and	1
a	1

was	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
barber	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
necessaries	1
for	1
shaving	1
are	1
there	1
any	1

the	1

and	1
seating	1
himself	1
at	1

on	1

replied	1
matvey	1
glancing	1
with	1
inquiring	1
sympathy	1
at	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
sly	1
smile	1
they	1

sent	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
jobbers	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
made	1
no	1

he	1
merely	1
glanced	1
at	1
matvey	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
in	1
the	1
glance	1
in	1
which	1
their	1
eyes	1
met	1
in	1
the	1

it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
they	1
understood	1

matvey	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
jacket	1
pockets	1
thrust	1
out	1
one	1
leg	1
and	1
gazed	1
silently	1
good	1
humoredly	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
at	1
his	1
master	1
i	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
sunday	1
and	1
till	1
then	1
not	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
or	1
themselves	1
for	1
nothing	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
obviously	1
prepared	1
the	1
sentence	1
beforehand	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
matvey	1
wanted	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
joke	1
and	1
attract	1
attention	1
to	1
himself	1
tearing	1
open	1
the	1
telegram	1
he	1
read	1
it	1
through	1
guessing	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
misspelt	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
are	1
in	1
telegrams	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
brightened	1
matvey	1
my	1
sister	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
said	1
checking	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
the	1
sleek	1
plump	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
barber	1
cutting	1
a	1
pink	1
path	1
through	1
his	1
long	1
curly	1
whiskers	1
thank	1
god	1
said	1
matvey	1
showing	1
by	1
this	1
response	1
that	1
he	1
like	1
his	1
master	1
realized	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
arrival	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
the	1
sister	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
might	1
bring	1
about	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
between	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
alone	1
or	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
inquired	1
matvey	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
as	1
the	1
barber	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
upper	1
lip	1
and	1
he	1
raised	1
one	1
finger	1
matvey	1
nodded	1
at	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
alone	1
is	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
ready	1
upstairs	1

repeated	1
as	1

in	1
doubt	1
yes	1
inform	1
her	1
here	1
take	1
the	1
telegram	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
then	1
do	1
what	1
she	1
tells	1
you	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
try	1
it	1
on	1
matvey	1
understood	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
said	1
yes	1
sir	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
already	1
washed	1
and	1
combed	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
dressed	1
when	1
matvey	1
stepping	1
deliberately	1
in	1
his	1
creaky	1
boots	1
came	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
telegram	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
barber	1
had	1
gone	1

told	1
me	1
to	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1

going	1
away	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
that	1
is	1
you	1
as	1
he	1
likes	1
he	1
said	1
laughing	1
only	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets	1
he	1
watched	1
his	1
master	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
silent	1
a	1
minute	1
then	1
a	1
good	1
humored	1
and	1
rather	1
pitiful	1
smile	1
showed	1
itself	1
on	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
eh	1
matvey	1
he	1
said	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1

she	1
will	1
come	1
round	1

so	1
who	1

there	1
asked	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
hearing	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1

at	1
the	1
door	1
it	1

i	1
said	1
a	1

and	1
the	1
stern	1
pockmarked	1
face	1
of	1
matrona	1
philimonovna	1
the	1

was	1
thrust	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
doorway	1
well	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
matrona	1
queried	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
although	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
completely	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
as	1
regards	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
this	1
himself	1
almost	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
even	1
the	1
nurse	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
chief	1

was	1
on	1
his	1

asked	1
disconsolately	1
go	1
to	1
her	1

besides	1
everything	1

said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
blushing	1
suddenly	1
well	1
now	1
do	1
dress	1
me	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
matvey	1
and	1
threw	1
off	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
decisively	1
matvey	1
was	1
already	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
shirt	1
like	1
a	1
horse	1
s	1
collar	1
and	1
blowing	1
off	1
some	1
invisible	1
speck	1
he	1
slipped	1
it	1
with	1
obvious	1
pleasure	1
over	1
the	1
well	1
groomed	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
chapter	1
3	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
sprinkled	1
some	1
scent	1
on	1
himself	1
pulled	1
down	1
his	1
shirt	1
cuffs	1
distributed	1
into	1
his	1
pockets	1
his	1
cigarettes	1
pocketbook	1
matches	1
and	1
watch	1
with	1
its	1
double	1
chain	1
and	1
seals	1
and	1
shaking	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
feeling	1
himself	1
clean	1
fragrant	1
healthy	1
and	1
physically	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
unhappiness	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
swing	1
on	1
each	1
leg	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
where	1
coffee	1
was	1
already	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
beside	1
the	1
coffee	1
letters	1
and	1
papers	1
from	1
the	1
office	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
letters	1
one	1
was	1
very	1
unpleasant	1
from	1
a	1
merchant	1
who	1
was	1
buying	1
a	1
forest	1
on	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
property	1
to	1
sell	1
this	1
forest	1
was	1
absolutely	1
essential	1
but	1
at	1
present	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
reconciled	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
the	1
subject	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
discussed	1
the	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
pecuniary	1
interests	1
should	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
his	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
led	1
on	1
by	1
his	1
interests	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
seek	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
that	1
idea	1
hurt	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
letters	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
moved	1
the	1
office	1
papers	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
rapidly	1
looked	1
through	1
two	1
pieces	1
of	1
business	1
made	1
a	1
few	1
notes	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
pencil	1
and	1
pushing	1
away	1
the	1
papers	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
coffee	1
as	1
he	1
sipped	1
his	1
coffee	1
he	1
opened	1
a	1
still	1
damp	1
morning	1
paper	1
and	1
began	1
reading	1
it	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
took	1
in	1
and	1
read	1
a	1
liberal	1
paper	1
not	1
an	1
extreme	1
one	1
but	1
one	1
advocating	1
the	1
views	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
majority	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
science	1
art	1
and	1
politics	1
had	1
no	1
special	1
interest	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
firmly	1
held	1
those	1
views	1
on	1
all	1
these	1
subjects	1
which	1
were	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
majority	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
paper	1
and	1
he	1
only	1
changed	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
majority	1
changed	1
them	1
or	1
more	1
strictly	1
speaking	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
them	1
but	1
they	1
imperceptibly	1
changed	1
of	1
themselves	1
within	1
him	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
not	1
chosen	1
his	1
political	1
opinions	1
or	1
his	1
views	1
these	1
political	1
opinions	1
and	1
views	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
themselves	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
the	1
shapes	1
of	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
coat	1
but	1
simply	1
took	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
worn	1
and	1
for	1
him	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
society	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
need	1
ordinarily	1
developed	1
at	1
years	1
of	1
discretion	1
for	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
mental	1
activity	1
to	1
have	1
views	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
indispensable	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
hat	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
his	1
preferring	1
liberal	1
to	1
conservative	1
views	1
which	1
were	1
held	1
also	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
circle	1
it	1
arose	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
considering	1
liberalism	1
more	1
rational	1
but	1
from	1
its	1
being	1
in	1
closer	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
the	1
liberal	1
party	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
russia	1
everything	1
is	1
wrong	1
and	1
certainly	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
many	1
debts	1
and	1
was	1
decidedly	1
short	1
of	1
money	1
the	1
liberal	1
party	1
said	1
that	1
marriage	1
is	1
an	1
institution	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
date	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
needs	1
reconstruction	1
and	1
family	1
life	1
certainly	1
afforded	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
little	1
gratification	1
and	1
forced	1
him	1
into	1
lying	1
and	1
hypocrisy	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
repulsive	1
to	1
his	1
nature	1
the	1
liberal	1
party	1
said	1
or	1
rather	1
allowed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
understood	1
that	1
religion	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
curb	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
check	1
the	1
barbarous	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
through	1
even	1
a	1
short	1
service	1
without	1
his	1
legs	1
aching	1
from	1
standing	1
up	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
terrible	1
and	1
high	1
flown	1
language	1
about	1
another	1
world	1
when	1
life	1
might	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
amusing	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
who	1
liked	1
a	1
joke	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
puzzling	1
a	1
plain	1
man	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
prided	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
origin	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
stop	1
at	1
rurik	1
and	1
disown	1
the	1
first	1
founder	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
the	1
monkey	1
and	1
so	1
liberalism	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
and	1
he	1
liked	1
his	1
newspaper	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
his	1
cigar	1
after	1
dinner	1
for	1
the	1
slight	1
fog	1
it	1
diffused	1
in	1
his	1
brain	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
leading	1
article	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
maintained	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
senseless	1
in	1
our	1
day	1
to	1
raise	1
an	1
outcry	1
that	1
radicalism	1
was	1
threatening	1
to	1
swallow	1
up	1
all	1
conservative	1
elements	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
ought	1
to	1
take	1
measures	1
to	1
crush	1
the	1
revolutionary	1
hydra	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
in	1
our	1
opinion	1
the	1
danger	1
lies	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
fantastic	1
revolutionary	1
hydra	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
obstinacy	1
of	1
traditionalism	1
clogging	1
progress	1
etc	1
etc	1
he	1
read	1
another	1
article	1
too	1
a	1
financial	1
one	1
which	1
alluded	1
to	1
bentham	1
and	1
mill	1
and	1
dropped	1
some	1
innuendoes	1
reflecting	1
on	1
the	1
ministry	1
with	1
his	1
characteristic	1
quickwittedness	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
drift	1
of	1
each	1
innuendo	1
divined	1
whence	1
it	1
came	1
at	1
whom	1
and	1
on	1
what	1
ground	1
it	1
was	1
aimed	1
and	1
that	1
afforded	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
did	1
a	1
certain	1
satisfaction	1
but	1
today	1
that	1
satisfaction	1
was	1
embittered	1
by	1
matrona	1
philimonovna	1
s	1
advice	1
and	1
the	1
unsatisfactory	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
he	1
read	1
too	1
that	1
count	1
beist	1
was	1
rumored	1
to	1
have	1
left	1
for	1
wiesbaden	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
need	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
gray	1
hair	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
a	1
light	1
carriage	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
person	1
seeking	1
a	1
situation	1
but	1
these	1
items	1
of	1
information	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
as	1
usual	1
a	1
quiet	1
ironical	1
gratification	1
having	1
finished	1
the	1
paper	1
a	1
second	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee	1
and	1
a	1
roll	1
and	1
butter	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
shaking	1
the	1
crumbs	1
of	1
the	1
roll	1
off	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
squaring	1
his	1
broad	1
chest	1
he	1
smiled	1
joyously	1
not	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
joyous	1
smile	1
was	1
evoked	1
by	1
a	1
good	1
digestion	1
but	1
this	1
joyous	1
smile	1
at	1
once	1
recalled	1
everything	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
thoughtful	1
two	1
childish	1
voices	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
recognized	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
grisha	1
his	1
youngest	1
boy	1
and	1
tanya	1
his	1
eldest	1
girl	1

down	1
the	1

their	1

the	1

ran	1
up	1
boldly	1
embraced	1
him	1
and	1
hung	1
laughingly	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
enjoying	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
scent	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
whiskers	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
kissed	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
flushed	1
from	1
his	1
stooping	1
posture	1
and	1
beaming	1
with	1
tenderness	1
loosed	1
her	1

was	1
about	1

her	1

held	1
her	1
back	1
how	1

he	1
was	1

the	1

less	1
and	1
always	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
fair	1

the	1

it	1

knew	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
quarrel	1
between	1
her	1
father	1

mother	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
could	1
not	1

and	1
that	1
her	1

must	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pretending	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
about	1
it	1
so	1
lightly	1
and	1
she	1

yesterday	1
a	1

matvey	1
in	1
the	1

with	1
a	1

impossible	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
as	1
he	1
generally	1
did	1
made	1
her	1
sit	1
down	1
heard	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
attentively	1
without	1

her	1

gave	1
her	1
detailed	1
advice	1

to	1
how	1

to	1

arkadyevitch	1
took	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
stopped	1
to	1
recollect	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
anything	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
nothing	1
except	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
forget	1
his	1
wife	1
ah	1
yes	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
harassed	1
expression	1
to	1
go	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
an	1
inner	1
voice	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
falsity	1
that	1
to	1
amend	1
to	1
set	1
right	1
their	1
relations	1
was	1
impossible	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
attractive	1
again	1
and	1
able	1
to	1
inspire	1
love	1
or	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
not	1
susceptible	1
to	1
love	1
except	1
deceit	1
and	1
lying	1
nothing	1
could	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
now	1
and	1
deceit	1
and	1
lying	1
were	1
opposed	1
to	1
his	1
nature	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
time	1
though	1
it	1
can	1

go	1
on	1

to	1
give	1
himself	1
courage	1
he	1
squared	1
his	1
chest	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
cigarette	1
took	1
two	1
whiffs	1
at	1
it	1
flung	1
it	1
into	1
a	1

with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
walked	1
through	1

with	1

now	1
scanty	1

luxuriant	1
and	1
beautiful	1
hair	1
fastened	1
up	1
with	1
hairpins	1
on	1
the	1
nape	1
of	1
her	1
neck	1
with	1
a	1
sunken	1
thin	1
face	1
and	1
large	1
startled	1
eyes	1
which	1
looked	1
prominent	1
from	1
the	1
thinness	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
standing	1
among	1
a	1
litter	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things	1
scattered	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
an	1
open	1
bureau	1
from	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
taking	1
something	1
hearing	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
steps	1
she	1
stopped	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
trying	1
assiduously	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
features	1
a	1
severe	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
expression	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
interview	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
attempting	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
attempted	1
to	1
do	1
ten	1
times	1
already	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
three	1
days	1
to	1
sort	1
out	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
things	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
but	1
now	1
again	1
as	1
each	1
time	1
before	1
she	1
kept	1
saying	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
things	1
cannot	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
take	1
some	1
step	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
shame	1
avenge	1
on	1
him	1
some	1
little	1
part	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
suffering	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
her	1
she	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
tell	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
leave	1
him	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
impossible	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
because	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
regarding	1
him	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
loving	1
him	1
besides	1
this	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
if	1
even	1
here	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
manage	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
her	1
five	1
children	1
properly	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
still	1
worse	1
off	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
with	1
them	1
all	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
three	1
days	1
the	1
youngest	1
was	1
unwell	1
from	1
being	1
given	1
unwholesome	1
soup	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
almost	1
gone	1
without	1
their	1
dinner	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
but	1
cheating	1
herself	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
sorting	1
out	1
her	1
things	1
and	1
pretending	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
seeing	1
her	1
husband	1
she	1
dropped	1
her	1
hands	1
into	1
the	1
drawer	1
of	1
the	1
bureau	1
as	1
though	1
looking	1
for	1
something	1
and	1
only	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
quite	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
severe	1
and	1
resolute	1
expression	1
betrayed	1
bewilderment	1
and	1
suffering	1
dolly	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
subdued	1
and	1
timid	1
voice	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
towards	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
look	1
pitiful	1
and	1
humble	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
radiant	1
with	1
freshness	1
and	1
health	1
in	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
she	1
scanned	1
his	1
figure	1
that	1
beamed	1
with	1
health	1
and	1
freshness	1
yes	1
he	1
is	1
happy	1
and	1
content	1
she	1
thought	1
while	1
i	1
and	1
that	1
disgusting	1
good	1
nature	1
which	1
everyone	1

him	1
for	1
and	1
praises	1

that	1
good	1
nature	1
of	1
his	1
she	1
thought	1
her	1
mouth	1
stiffened	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
the	1
cheek	1
contracted	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
pale	1
nervous	1
face	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
rapid	1
deep	1
unnatural	1
voice	1
dolly	1
he	1
repeated	1
with	1
a	1
quiver	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
anna	1

well	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
can	1

she	1
cried	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
really	1
dolly	1
go	1
away	1
go	1
away	1
go	1
away	1
she	1
shrieked	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
this	1
shriek	1
were	1
called	1
up	1
by	1
physical	1
pain	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
could	1
be	1
calm	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
could	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
round	1
as	1
matvey	1
expressed	1
it	1
and	1
could	1
quietly	1
go	1
on	1
reading	1
his	1
paper	1
and	1
drinking	1
his	1
coffee	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
tortured	1
suffering	1
face	1
heard	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
submissive	1
to	1
fate	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
despair	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
catch	1
in	1
his	1
breath	1
and	1
a	1
lump	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
began	1
to	1
shine	1
with	1
tears	1
my	1
god	1
what	1
have	1
i	1
done	1
dolly	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sob	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
she	1
shut	1
the	1
bureau	1
with	1
a	1
slam	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
dolly	1
what	1
can	1
i	1
say	1
one	1
thing	1
forgive	1
remember	1
cannot	1
nine	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
atone	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
she	1
dropped	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
listened	1
expecting	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
beseeching	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
believe	1
differently	1
instant	1
of	1
passion	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
word	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
pang	1
of	1
physical	1
pain	1
her	1
lips	1
stiffened	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
her	1
right	1
cheek	1
worked	1
go	1
away	1

out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
shrieked	1
still	1
more	1
shrilly	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
your	1
passion	1
and	1
your	1
loathsomeness	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
but	1
tottered	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
to	1
support	1
herself	1
his	1
face	1
relaxed	1
his	1
lips	1
swelled	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
swimming	1
with	1
tears	1
dolly	1
he	1
said	1
sobbing	1
now	1
for	1

of	1
the	1
children	1

she	1
sat	1
down	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
hard	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
unutterably	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1

could	1
not	1

said	1
obviously	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
phrases	1
she	1

with	1

how	1
vulgarly	1
she	1

the	1

stood	1
a	1

he	1
smiled	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
a	1

maybe	1

stepping	1
back	1
onto	1
the	1

darya	1

having	1
pacified	1
the	1

knowing	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
went	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
her	1
bedroom	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
solitary	1
refuge	1
from	1
the	1
household	1
cares	1
which	1
crowded	1
upon	1
her	1
directly	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
it	1
even	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
short	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
and	1
matrona	1
philimonovna	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
putting	1
several	1
questions	1
to	1
her	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
delay	1
and	1
which	1
only	1
she	1
could	1
answer	1
what	1
were	1
the	1
children	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
for	1
their	1

should	1
they	1

me	1
alone	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
bedroom	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
sat	1
when	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
clasping	1
tightly	1
her	1
thin	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
rings	1
that	1
slipped	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
bony	1
fingers	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
going	1
over	1
in	1
her	1
memory	1
all	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
but	1
has	1
he	1
broken	1
it	1
off	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
thought	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
he	1
sees	1
her	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1
i	1
ask	1
him	1
no	1
no	1

impossible	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
we	1
are	1
strangers	1
strangers	1
forever	1
she	1
repeated	1
again	1
with	1
special	1
significance	1
the	1
word	1
so	1
dreadful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
how	1
i	1
loved	1
him	1
my	1
god	1
how	1
i	1
loved	1
him	1
how	1
i	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1

i	1
love	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
before	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
thing	1
is	1
she	1
began	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
her	1
thought	1
because	1
matrona	1
philimonovna	1
put	1
her	1
head	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
let	1
us	1
send	1
for	1
my	1
brother	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
dinner	1
anyway	1
or	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
children	1
getting	1
nothing	1

very	1
well	1

about	1
it	1
but	1
did	1
you	1
send	1
for	1
some	1
new	1
milk	1
and	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
drowned	1
her	1
grief	1
in	1
them	1
for	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
learned	1
easily	1
at	1
school	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
excellent	1
abilities	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
idle	1
and	1
mischievous	1
and	1
therefore	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lowest	1
in	1
his	1
class	1

in	1

of	1
his	1
habitually	1

mode	1
of	1

his	1
inferior	1
grade	1
in	1

position	1
of	1

of	1

some	1

similar	1
one	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
salary	1
of	1
six	1
thousand	1
absolutely	1
needful	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
affairs	1
in	1

of	1
his	1

of	1

the	1

of	1

had	1

him	1
in	1
petticoats	1
another	1
third	1
were	1
his	1
intimate	1
chums	1
and	1
the	1

the	1

one	1
of	1

oblonsky	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
special	1
exertion	1
to	1
get	1
a	1

post	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
not	1
to	1
refuse	1
things	1
not	1
to	1
show	1
jealousy	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
quarrelsome	1

take	1
offense	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
from	1
his	1
characteristic	1
good	1
nature	1
he	1
never	1
did	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
absurd	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
get	1
a	1
position	1
with	1
the	1
salary	1
he	1
required	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
expected	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
only	1
wanted	1
what	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
age	1
and	1
standing	1
did	1
get	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
worse	1
qualified	1
for	1
performing	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
liked	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
humor	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
bright	1
disposition	1
and	1
his	1
unquestionable	1
honesty	1
in	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
handsome	1
radiant	1
figure	1
his	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
black	1
hair	1
and	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
and	1
red	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
which	1
produced	1
a	1
physical	1
effect	1
of	1
kindliness	1
and	1
good	1
humor	1
on	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
met	1
him	1
aha	1
stiva	1
oblonsky	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
was	1
almost	1
always	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
delight	1
on	1
meeting	1
him	1
even	1
though	1
it	1
happened	1
at	1
times	1
that	1
after	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
nothing	1
particularly	1
delightful	1
had	1
happened	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
everyone	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
delighted	1
at	1
meeting	1
him	1
again	1
after	1
filling	1
for	1
three	1
years	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
president	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
boards	1
at	1
moscow	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
won	1
the	1
respect	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
liking	1
of	1
his	1
fellow	1
officials	1
subordinates	1
and	1
superiors	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
business	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
principal	1
qualities	1
in	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
which	1
had	1
gained	1
him	1
this	1
universal	1
respect	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
consisted	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
extreme	1
indulgence	1
for	1
others	1
founded	1
on	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
shortcomings	1
secondly	1
of	1
his	1
perfect	1
liberalism	1
not	1
the	1
liberalism	1
he	1
read	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
but	1
the	1
liberalism	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
blood	1
in	1
virtue	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
treated	1
all	1
men	1
perfectly	1
equally	1
and	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
whatever	1
their	1
fortune	1
or	1
calling	1
might	1
be	1
and	1
thirdly	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
point	1
his	1
complete	1
indifference	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
never	1

escorted	1
by	1
a	1
deferential	1
porter	1
with	1

went	1
into	1
his	1
little	1

moved	1
quickly	1
as	1
ever	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
shook	1

with	1

sat	1
down	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
joke	1

two	1
and	1
talked	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
was	1
consistent	1
with	1

and	1
began	1
work	1
no	1

better	1
than	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
how	1
to	1
hit	1
on	1
the	1
exact	1
line	1
between	1
freedom	1
simplicity	1
and	1
official	1
stiffness	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1

came	1
up	1
with	1
papers	1

began	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
familiar	1
and	1
easy	1
tone	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
introduced	1
by	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
we	1
have	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
the	1

from	1

of	1

here	1

arkadyevitch	1
laying	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
paper	1
now	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
the	1
sitting	1
of	1
the	1
board	1
began	1
if	1
they	1
knew	1
he	1
thought	1
bending	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
air	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
report	1
what	1
a	1
guilty	1
little	1
boy	1
their	1
president	1
was	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
laughing	1
during	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
report	1
till	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
sitting	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
without	1
a	1
break	1
and	1
at	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
interval	1
and	1
luncheon	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
two	1
when	1
the	1
large	1
glass	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
boardroom	1
suddenly	1
opened	1
and	1
someone	1
came	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
officials	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
further	1
side	1
under	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
tsar	1
and	1
the	1
eagle	1
delighted	1
at	1
any	1
distraction	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
the	1
doorkeeper	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
once	1
drove	1
out	1
the	1
intruder	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
glass	1
door	1
after	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
case	1
had	1
been	1
read	1
through	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
stretched	1
and	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
liberalism	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
cigarette	1
in	1
the	1
boardroom	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
private	1
room	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
board	1
the	1
old	1
veteran	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
nikitin	1
and	1
the	1
kammerjunker	1
grinevitch	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
him	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
after	1
lunch	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
we	1
shall	1
said	1
nikitin	1
a	1
pretty	1
sharp	1
fellow	1
this	1
fomin	1
must	1
be	1
said	1
grinevitch	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
they	1
were	1
examining	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
frowned	1
at	1
grinevitch	1
s	1
words	1
giving	1
him	1
thereby	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
improper	1
to	1
pass	1
judgment	1
prematurely	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
no	1
reply	1
who	1
was	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
doorkeeper	1
someone	1
your	1
excellency	1
crept	1
in	1
without	1
permission	1
directly	1
my	1
back	1
was	1
turned	1
he	1
was	1
asking	1
for	1
you	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
members	1
come	1
out	1
then	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
maybe	1
he	1
s	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
but	1
here	1
he	1
comes	1
anyway	1
that	1
is	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
doorkeeper	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
strongly	1
built	1
broad	1
shouldered	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
curly	1
beard	1
who	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
sheepskin	1
cap	1
was	1
running	1
lightly	1
and	1
rapidly	1
up	1
the	1
worn	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
stone	1
staircase	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
going	1
down	1
a	1
lean	1
official	1
with	1
a	1
portfolio	1
stood	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
and	1
looked	1
disapprovingly	1
at	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
then	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
oblonsky	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairs	1
his	1
good	1
naturedly	1
beaming	1
face	1
above	1
the	1
embroidered	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
uniform	1
beamed	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
when	1
he	1
recognized	1
the	1
man	1
coming	1
up	1
why	1
it	1
s	1
actually	1
you	1
levin	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
mocking	1
smile	1
scanning	1
levin	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
deigned	1
to	1
look	1
me	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
den	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
and	1
not	1
content	1
with	1
shaking	1
hands	1
he	1
kissed	1
his	1
friend	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
i	1
have	1
just	1
come	1
and	1
very	1
much	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
said	1
levin	1
looking	1
shyly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
angrily	1
and	1
uneasily	1
around	1
well	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
who	1
knew	1
his	1
friend	1
s	1
sensitive	1
and	1
irritable	1
shyness	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
drew	1
him	1
along	1
as	1
though	1
guiding	1
him	1
through	1
dangers	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
on	1
familiar	1
terms	1
with	1
almost	1
all	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
called	1
almost	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
christian	1
names	1
old	1
men	1
of	1
sixty	1
boys	1
of	1
twenty	1
actors	1
ministers	1
merchants	1
and	1
adjutant	1
generals	1
so	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
intimate	1
chums	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
at	1
the	1
extreme	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
social	1
ladder	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
oblonsky	1
something	1
in	1
common	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
familiar	1
friend	1
of	1
everyone	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
champagne	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
champagne	1
with	1
everyone	1
and	1
when	1
in	1
consequence	1
he	1
met	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
disreputable	1
chums	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
in	1
joke	1
to	1
call	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
subordinates	1
he	1
well	1
knew	1
how	1
with	1
his	1
characteristic	1
tact	1
to	1
diminish	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
made	1
on	1
them	1
levin	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
disreputable	1
chum	1
but	1
oblonsky	1
with	1
his	1
ready	1
tact	1
felt	1
that	1
levin	1
fancied	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
intimacy	1
with	1
him	1
before	1
his	1
subordinates	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
off	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
levin	1
was	1
almost	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
as	1
oblonsky	1
their	1
intimacy	1
did	1
not	1
rest	1
merely	1
on	1
champagne	1
levin	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
friend	1
and	1
companion	1
of	1
his	1
early	1
youth	1
they	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
their	1
characters	1
and	1
tastes	1
as	1
friends	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
together	1
in	1
early	1
youth	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
selected	1
careers	1
of	1
different	1
kinds	1
though	1
in	1
discussion	1
he	1
would	1
even	1
justify	1
the	1
other	1
s	1
career	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
despised	1
it	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
led	1
himself	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
real	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
led	1
by	1
his	1
friend	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
phantasm	1
oblonsky	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
a	1
slight	1
mocking	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
levin	1
how	1
often	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
moscow	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
but	1
what	1
precisely	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
could	1
never	1
quite	1
make	1
out	1
and	1
indeed	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
levin	1
arrived	1
in	1
moscow	1
always	1
excited	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
rather	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
irritated	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
want	1
of	1
ease	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
with	1
a	1
perfectly	1
new	1
unexpected	1
view	1
of	1
things	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
laughed	1
at	1
this	1
and	1
liked	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
levin	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
despised	1
the	1
town	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
his	1
official	1
duties	1
which	1
he	1
laughed	1
at	1
and	1
regarded	1
as	1
trifling	1
but	1
the	1
difference	1
was	1
that	1
oblonsky	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
everyone	1
did	1
laughed	1
complacently	1
and	1
good	1
humoredly	1
while	1
levin	1
laughed	1
without	1
complacency	1
and	1
sometimes	1
angrily	1
we	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
expecting	1
you	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
going	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
letting	1
levin	1
s	1
hand	1
go	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
here	1
all	1
danger	1
was	1
over	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
well	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
eh	1
when	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
levin	1
was	1
silent	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
unknown	1
faces	1
of	1
oblonsky	1
s	1
two	1
companions	1
and	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
elegant	1
grinevitch	1
which	1
had	1
such	1
long	1
white	1
fingers	1
such	1
long	1
yellow	1
filbert	1
shaped	1
nails	1
and	1
such	1
huge	1
shining	1
studs	1
on	1
the	1
shirt	1
cuff	1
that	1
apparently	1
they	1
absorbed	1
all	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
allowed	1
him	1
no	1
freedom	1
of	1
thought	1
oblonsky	1
noticed	1
this	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
smiled	1
ah	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
my	1
colleagues	1
philip	1
ivanitch	1
nikitin	1
mihail	1
stanislavitch	1
grinevitch	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
levin	1
a	1
district	1
councilor	1
a	1
modern	1
district	1
councilman	1
a	1
gymnast	1
who	1
lifts	1
thirteen	1

with	1

the	1

i	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
knowing	1
your	1
brother	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
said	1
grinevitch	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
slender	1
hand	1
with	1
its	1
long	1
nails	1
levin	1
frowned	1
shook	1
hands	1
coldly	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
turned	1
to	1
oblonsky	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
half	1
brother	1
an	1
author	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
russia	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
it	1
when	1
people	1
treated	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
celebrated	1
koznishev	1
no	1
i	1
am	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1

with	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
meetings	1
any	1
more	1
he	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
oblonsky	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
quick	1
about	1
it	1
said	1
oblonsky	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
but	1
how	1
why	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
long	1
story	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
some	1
time	1
said	1
levin	1
but	1
he	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
well	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
shortly	1
i	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
really	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
district	1
councils	1
or	1
ever	1
could	1
be	1
he	1
began	1
as	1
though	1
someone	1
had	1
just	1
insulted	1
him	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
plaything	1
they	1
play	1
at	1
being	1
a	1
parliament	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
neither	1
young	1
enough	1
nor	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
find	1
amusement	1
in	1
playthings	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
he	1
stammered	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
means	1
for	1
the	1
coterie	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
to	1
make	1
money	1
formerly	1
they	1
had	1
wardships	1
courts	1
of	1
justice	1
now	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
bribes	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
unearned	1
salary	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
hotly	1
as	1
though	1
someone	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
had	1
opposed	1
his	1
opinion	1

however	1
we	1
can	1
go	1
into	1
that	1
later	1
yes	1
later	1
but	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
said	1
levin	1
looking	1
with	1
hatred	1
at	1
grinevitch	1
s	1
hand	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
gave	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
wear	1
european	1
dress	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
scanning	1
his	1
new	1
suit	1
obviously	1
cut	1
by	1
a	1
french	1
tailor	1
ah	1
i	1
see	1
a	1
new	1
phase	1
levin	1
suddenly	1
blushed	1
not	1
as	1
grown	1
men	1
blush	1
slightly	1
without	1
being	1
themselves	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
as	1
boys	1
blush	1
feeling	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
ridiculous	1
through	1
their	1
shyness	1
and	1
consequently	1
ashamed	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
blushing	1
still	1
more	1
almost	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
sensible	1
manly	1
face	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
childish	1
plight	1
that	1
oblonsky	1
left	1
off	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
oh	1
where	1
shall	1
we	1
meet	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
want	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
levin	1
oblonsky	1
seemed	1
to	1
ponder	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
to	1
gurin	1
s	1
to	1
lunch	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
can	1
talk	1
i	1
am	1
free	1
till	1
three	1
no	1
answered	1
levin	1
after	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
thought	1
i	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
somewhere	1
else	1
all	1
right	1
then	1
let	1
s	1
dine	1
together	1
dine	1
together	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
very	1
particular	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
a	1
question	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
afterwards	1
well	1
say	1
the	1
few	1
words	1
then	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
gossip	1
after	1
dinner	1
well	1
it	1
s	1
this	1
said	1
levin	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
though	1
his	1
face	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
took	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
anger	1
from	1
the	1
effort	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
to	1
surmount	1
his	1
shyness	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
doing	1
everything	1
as	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
he	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
known	1
that	1
levin	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
kitty	1
gave	1
a	1
hardly	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
merrily	1
you	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
answer	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
because	1
excuse	1
me	1
a	1
minute	1
a	1
secretary	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
respectful	1
familiarity	1
and	1
the	1
modest	1
consciousness	1
characteristic	1
of	1
every	1
secretary	1
of	1
superiority	1
to	1
his	1
chief	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
business	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
oblonsky	1
with	1
some	1
papers	1
and	1
began	1
under	1
pretense	1
of	1
asking	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
explain	1
some	1
objection	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
without	1
hearing	1
him	1
out	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
genially	1
on	1
the	1
secretary	1
s	1
sleeve	1
no	1
you	1
do	1
as	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
softening	1
his	1
words	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
brief	1
explanation	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
said	1
so	1
do	1
it	1
that	1
way	1
if	1
you	1
please	1

nikititch	1
the	1
secretary	1
retired	1
in	1
confusion	1
during	1
the	1
consultation	1
with	1
the	1
secretary	1
levin	1
had	1
completely	1
recovered	1
from	1
his	1
embarrassment	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
ironical	1
attention	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
what	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
understand	1
said	1
oblonsky	1
smiling	1
as	1
brightly	1
as	1
ever	1
and	1
picking	1
up	1
a	1
cigarette	1
he	1
expected	1
some	1
queer	1
outburst	1
from	1
levin	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
said	1
levin	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
seriously	1
why	1
not	1
why	1
because	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
but	1
we	1
re	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
work	1
on	1
paper	1
but	1
there	1
you	1
ve	1
a	1
gift	1
for	1
it	1
added	1
levin	1
that	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
think	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
something	1
in	1
me	1
perhaps	1
so	1
said	1
levin	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
i	1
admire	1
your	1
grandeur	1
and	1
am	1
proud	1
that	1
i	1
ve	1
a	1
friend	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
person	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
answered	1
my	1
question	1
though	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
desperate	1
effort	1
looking	1
oblonsky	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
oh	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
you	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1

over	1
six	1

and	1

of	1

away	1
so	1
long	1

panic	1
stricken	1
oh	1

responded	1
oblonsky	1

over	1

again	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
ears	1
all	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
called	1
out	1
laughing	1
no	1
truly	1
and	1
levin	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
remembering	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
oblonsky	1
s	1
colleagues	1
that	1
gentleman	1
must	1
be	1

arkadyevitch	1
ah	1
yes	1
i	1
m	1
in	1
a	1
poor	1
way	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
sigh	1
chapter	1
6	1
when	1
oblonsky	1
asked	1
levin	1
what	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
town	1
levin	1
blushed	1
and	1
was	1
furious	1
with	1
himself	1
for	1
blushing	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
an	1
offer	1
though	1
that	1
was	1
precisely	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
levins	1
and	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
were	1
old	1
noble	1
moscow	1
families	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
on	1
intimate	1
and	1
friendly	1
terms	1
this	1
intimacy	1
had	1
grown	1
still	1
closer	1
during	1
levin	1
s	1
student	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
both	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
university	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
prince	1
shtcherbatsky	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
kitty	1
and	1
dolly	1
and	1
had	1
entered	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
levin	1
used	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
shtcherbatsky	1
household	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
appear	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
household	1
the	1
family	1
that	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
especially	1
with	1
the	1
feminine	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
his	1
own	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
only	1
sister	1
was	1
older	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
inner	1
life	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
noble	1
cultivated	1
and	1
honorable	1
family	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
deprived	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
that	1
family	1
especially	1
the	1
feminine	1
half	1
were	1
pictured	1
by	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
wrapped	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
mysterious	1
poetical	1
veil	1
and	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
perceived	1
no	1
defects	1
whatever	1
in	1
them	1
but	1
under	1
the	1
poetical	1
veil	1
that	1
shrouded	1
them	1
he	1
assumed	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
loftiest	1
sentiments	1
and	1
every	1
possible	1
perfection	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
had	1
one	1
day	1
to	1
speak	1
french	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
english	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
certain	1
hours	1
they	1
played	1
by	1
turns	1
on	1
the	1
piano	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
audible	1
in	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
room	1
above	1
where	1
the	1
students	1
used	1
to	1
work	1
why	1
they	1
were	1
visited	1
by	1
those	1
professors	1
of	1
french	1
literature	1
of	1
music	1
of	1
drawing	1
of	1
dancing	1
why	1
at	1
certain	1
hours	1
all	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
with	1
mademoiselle	1
linon	1
drove	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
to	1
the	1
tversky	1
boulevard	1
dressed	1
in	1
their	1
satin	1
cloaks	1
dolly	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
one	1
natalia	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
long	1
one	1
and	1
kitty	1
in	1
one	1
so	1
short	1
that	1
her	1
shapely	1
legs	1
in	1
tightly	1
drawn	1
red	1
stockings	1
were	1
visible	1
to	1
all	1
beholders	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
walk	1
about	1
the	1
tversky	1
boulevard	1
escorted	1
by	1
a	1
footman	1
with	1
a	1
gold	1
cockade	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
their	1
mysterious	1
world	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
there	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
precisely	1
with	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
proceedings	1
in	1
his	1
student	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
but	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
eldest	1
dolly	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
married	1
to	1
oblonsky	1
then	1
he	1
began	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
second	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sisters	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
make	1
out	1
which	1
but	1
natalia	1
too	1
had	1
hardly	1
made	1
her	1
appearance	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
when	1
she	1
married	1
the	1
diplomat	1
lvov	1
kitty	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
levin	1
left	1
the	1
university	1
young	1
shtcherbatsky	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
navy	1
was	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
baltic	1
and	1
levin	1
s	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
friendship	1
with	1
oblonsky	1
became	1
less	1
intimate	1
but	1
when	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
this	1
year	1
levin	1
came	1
to	1
moscow	1
after	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
he	1
realized	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
sisters	1
he	1
was	1
indeed	1
destined	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
simpler	1
than	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
rather	1
rich	1
than	1
poor	1
and	1
thirty	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
young	1
princess	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
have	1
been	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
match	1
but	1
levin	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
kitty	1
was	1

that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
creature	1

low	1

so	1
earthly	1
that	1
it	1

she	1
herself	1
could	1
regard	1
him	1

of	1
her	1

two	1
months	1
in	1

a	1
state	1

abruptly	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1

went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
levin	1
s	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
was	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
her	1
family	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
disadvantageous	1
and	1
worthless	1
match	1
for	1
the	1
charming	1
kitty	1
and	1
that	1
kitty	1
herself	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
him	1
in	1
her	1

would	1

to	1
be	1
a	1

still	1
more	1
a	1
distinguished	1
man	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
women	1
often	1
did	1
care	1
for	1
ugly	1

men	1

he	1
did	1
not	1

any	1

exceptional	1
women	1
but	1
after	1
spending	1
two	1
months	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
passions	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
experience	1
in	1
his	1
early	1
youth	1
that	1
this	1
feeling	1
gave	1
him	1
not	1
an	1

rest	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
without	1
deciding	1
the	1
question	1
would	1
she	1
or	1
would	1
she	1
not	1
be	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
despair	1
had	1
arisen	1
only	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
imaginings	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
proof	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
rejected	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
moscow	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
determination	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
get	1
married	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
accepted	1
or	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
him	1
if	1

were	1
rejected	1
chapter	1

on	1
arriving	1
in	1
moscow	1
by	1
a	1
morning	1
train	1
levin	1
had	1
put	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
elder	1
half	1
brother	1
koznishev	1
after	1
changing	1
his	1
clothes	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
study	1
intending	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
about	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
advice	1
but	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
not	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
professor	1
of	1
philosophy	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
harkov	1
expressly	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
a	1
difference	1
that	1
had	1
arisen	1
between	1
them	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
philosophical	1
question	1
the	1
professor	1
was	1
carrying	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
crusade	1
against	1
materialists	1
sergey	1
koznishev	1
had	1
been	1
following	1
this	1
crusade	1
with	1
interest	1
and	1
after	1
reading	1
the	1
professor	1
s	1
last	1
article	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
stating	1
his	1
objections	1
he	1
accused	1
the	1
professor	1
of	1
making	1
too	1
great	1
concessions	1
to	1
the	1
materialists	1
and	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
promptly	1
appeared	1
to	1
argue	1
the	1
matter	1
out	1
the	1
point	1
in	1
discussion	1
was	1
the	1
question	1
then	1
in	1
vogue	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
between	1
psychological	1
and	1
physiological	1
phenomena	1
in	1
man	1
and	1
if	1
so	1
where	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
met	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
chilly	1
friendliness	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
for	1
everyone	1
and	1
introducing	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
professor	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
a	1
little	1
man	1
in	1
spectacles	1
with	1
a	1
narrow	1
forehead	1
tore	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
discussion	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
greet	1
levin	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
without	1
paying	1
any	1
further	1
attention	1
to	1
him	1
levin	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
the	1
professor	1
should	1
go	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
subject	1
under	1
discussion	1
levin	1
had	1
come	1
across	1
the	1
magazine	1
articles	1
about	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
disputing	1
and	1
had	1
read	1
them	1
interested	1
in	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
principles	1
of	1
science	1
familiar	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
natural	1
science	1
student	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
connected	1
these	1
scientific	1
deductions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
man	1
as	1
an	1
animal	1
as	1
to	1
reflex	1
action	1
biology	1
and	1
sociology	1
with	1
those	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
to	1
himself	1
which	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
argument	1
with	1
the	1
professor	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
connected	1
these	1
scientific	1
questions	1
with	1
those	1
spiritual	1
problems	1
that	1
at	1
times	1
they	1
almost	1
touched	1
on	1
the	1
latter	1
but	1
every	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
close	1
upon	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
chief	1
point	1
they	1
promptly	1
beat	1
a	1
hasty	1
retreat	1
and	1
plunged	1
again	1
into	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
subtle	1
distinctions	1
reservations	1
quotations	1
allusions	1
and	1
appeals	1
to	1
authorities	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
i	1
cannot	1
admit	1
it	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
with	1
his	1
habitual	1
clearness	1
precision	1
of	1
expression	1
and	1
elegance	1
of	1
phrase	1
i	1
cannot	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
agree	1
with	1
keiss	1
that	1
my	1
whole	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
has	1
been	1
derived	1
from	1
perceptions	1
the	1
most	1
fundamental	1
idea	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
existence	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
received	1
by	1
me	1
through	1
sensation	1
indeed	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
special	1
sense	1
organ	1
for	1
the	1
transmission	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
yes	1
but	1
they	1
wurt	1
and	1
knaust	1
and	1
pripasov	1
would	1
answer	1
that	1
your	1
consciousness	1
of	1
existence	1
is	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
conjunction	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
sensations	1
that	1
that	1
consciousness	1
of	1
existence	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
your	1
sensations	1
wurt	1
indeed	1
says	1
plainly	1
that	1
assuming	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
sensations	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
existence	1
i	1
maintain	1
the	1
contrary	1
began	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
but	1
here	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
close	1
upon	1
the	1
real	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
retreating	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
the	1
professor	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
senses	1
are	1
annihilated	1
if	1
my	1
body	1
is	1
dead	1
i	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
existence	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
he	1
queried	1
the	1
professor	1
in	1
annoyance	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
mental	1
suffering	1
at	1
the	1
interruption	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
inquirer	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
bargeman	1
than	1
a	1
philosopher	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
s	1
one	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
with	1
far	1
less	1
heat	1
and	1
one	1
sidedness	1
than	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
sufficient	1
breadth	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
comprehend	1
the	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
put	1
smiled	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
question	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
answer	1
as	1
yet	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
requisite	1
data	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
argument	1
no	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
would	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
if	1
as	1
pripasov	1
directly	1
asserts	1
perception	1
is	1
based	1
on	1
sensation	1
then	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
distinguish	1
sharply	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
conceptions	1
levin	1
listened	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
simply	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
professor	1
to	1
go	1
chapter	1
8	1
when	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
gone	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
delighted	1
that	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
is	1
it	1
how	1
s	1
your	1
farming	1
getting	1
on	1
levin	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
elder	1
brother	1
took	1
little	1
interest	1
in	1
farming	1
and	1
only	1
put	1
the	1
question	1
in	1
deference	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
only	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
his	1
wheat	1
and	1
money	1
matters	1
levin	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
his	1
determination	1
to	1
get	1
married	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
advice	1
he	1
had	1
indeed	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
but	1
after	1
seeing	1
his	1
brother	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
professor	1
hearing	1
afterwards	1
the	1
unconsciously	1
patronizing	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
brother	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
agricultural	1
matters	1
their	1
mother	1
s	1
property	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
divided	1
and	1
levin	1
took	1
charge	1
of	1
both	1
their	1
shares	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
begin	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
marrying	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
would	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
well	1
how	1

pity	1
commented	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
frowning	1
levin	1
in	1
self	1

began	1
to	1
describe	1
what	1
took	1

that	1

perhaps	1
it	1
s	1
our	1
strong	1
point	1
really	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
seeing	1
our	1
own	1
shortcomings	1

we	1
overdo	1
it	1
we	1
comfort	1
ourselves	1
with	1
irony	1

we	1

on	1
the	1

his	1

at	1

the	1

sergey	1

took	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
under	1
a	1
paper	1

handed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1

without	1

stood	1
with	1
the	1
note	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
opposite	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
struggle	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
between	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
forget	1
his	1
unhappy	1
brother	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
base	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
he	1
obviously	1
wants	1
to	1
offend	1
me	1
pursued	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1

he	1
cannot	1

me	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
wished	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
it	1

impossible	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
yes	1
yes	1
repeated	1
levin	1

your	1
attitude	1

i	1
shall	1
go	1

see	1
him	1
if	1
you	1

of	1
your	1

will	1
not	1
make	1
you	1

for	1
your	1

on	1
what	1

his	1

footman	1
levin	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
setting	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
but	1
on	1
second	1
thought	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
his	1
visit	1
till	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
set	1

at	1

to	1
accomplish	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
moscow	1
for	1
from	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
levin	1
went	1
to	1
oblonsky	1

office	1
and	1
on	1
getting	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
kitty	1
chapter	1

at	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
levin	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hired	1
sledge	1
at	1
the	1
zoological	1
gardens	1
and	1
turned	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
frozen	1
mounds	1
and	1
the	1
skating	1
ground	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
find	1
her	1
there	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
carriage	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
bright	1
frosty	1
day	1
rows	1
of	1
carriages	1
sledges	1
drivers	1
and	1
policemen	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
approach	1
crowds	1
of	1
well	1
dressed	1
people	1
with	1
hats	1
bright	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
swarmed	1
about	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
well	1
swept	1
little	1
paths	1
between	1
the	1
little	1
houses	1
adorned	1
with	1
carving	1
in	1
the	1
russian	1
style	1
the	1
old	1
curly	1
birches	1
of	1
the	1
gardens	1
all	1
their	1
twigs	1
laden	1
with	1
snow	1
looked	1
as	1
though	1
freshly	1
decked	1
in	1
sacred	1
vestments	1
he	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
towards	1
the	1
skating	1
ground	1
and	1
kept	1
saying	1
to	1
himself	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
be	1
excited	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
calm	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
be	1
quiet	1
stupid	1
he	1
conjured	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
compose	1
himself	1
the	1
more	1
breathless	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
met	1
him	1
and	1
called	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
name	1
but	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
recognize	1
him	1
he	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
mounds	1
whence	1
came	1
the	1
clank	1
of	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
sledges	1
as	1
they	1
slipped	1
down	1
or	1
were	1
dragged	1
up	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
the	1
sliding	1
sledges	1
and	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
merry	1
voices	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
and	1
the	1
skating	1
ground	1
lay	1
open	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
amidst	1
all	1
the	1
skaters	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
rapture	1
and	1
the	1
terror	1
that	1
seized	1
on	1
his	1
heart	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
there	1
was	1
apparently	1
nothing	1
striking	1
either	1
in	1
her	1
dress	1
or	1
her	1
attitude	1
but	1
for	1
levin	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
easy	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
that	1
crowd	1
as	1
a	1
rose	1
among	1
nettles	1
everything	1
was	1
made	1
bright	1
by	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
smile	1
that	1
shed	1
light	1
on	1
all	1
round	1
her	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
i	1
can	1
go	1
over	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
ice	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
stood	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
holy	1
shrine	1
unapproachable	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
retreating	1
so	1
overwhelmed	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
terror	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
master	1
himself	1
and	1
to	1
remind	1
himself	1
that	1
people	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
were	1
moving	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
might	1
come	1
there	1
to	1
skate	1
he	1
walked	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
avoiding	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
but	1
seeing	1
her	1
as	1
one	1
does	1
the	1
sun	1
without	1
looking	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
day	1
people	1
of	1
one	1
set	1
all	1
acquainted	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
used	1
to	1
meet	1
on	1
the	1
ice	1
there	1
were	1
crack	1
skaters	1
there	1
showing	1
off	1
their	1
skill	1
and	1
learners	1
clinging	1
to	1
chairs	1
with	1
timid	1
awkward	1
movements	1
boys	1
and	1
elderly	1
people	1
skating	1
with	1
hygienic	1
motives	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
an	1
elect	1
band	1
of	1
blissful	1
beings	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
here	1
near	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
skaters	1
it	1
seemed	1
with	1
perfect	1
self	1
possession	1
skated	1
towards	1
her	1
skated	1
by	1
her	1
even	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
happy	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
her	1
enjoying	1
the	1
capital	1
ice	1
and	1
the	1
fine	1
weather	1
nikolay	1
shtcherbatsky	1
kitty	1
s	1
cousin	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
jacket	1
and	1
tight	1
trousers	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
garden	1
seat	1
with	1
his	1
skates	1
on	1
seeing	1
levin	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
him	1
ah	1
the	1
first	1
skater	1
in	1
russia	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
first	1
rate	1
ice	1
do	1
put	1
your	1
skates	1
on	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
got	1
my	1
skates	1
levin	1
answered	1
marveling	1
at	1
this	1
boldness	1
and	1
ease	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
one	1
second	1
losing	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
sun	1
were	1
coming	1
near	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
and	1
turning	1
out	1
her	1
slender	1
feet	1
in	1
their	1
high	1
boots	1
with	1
obvious	1
timidity	1
she	1
skated	1
towards	1
him	1
a	1
boy	1
in	1
russian	1
dress	1
desperately	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
overtook	1
her	1
she	1
skated	1
a	1
little	1
uncertainly	1
taking	1
her	1
hands	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
muff	1
that	1
hung	1
on	1
a	1
cord	1
she	1
held	1
them	1
ready	1
for	1
emergency	1
and	1
looking	1
towards	1
levin	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
recognized	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
fears	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
got	1
round	1
the	1
turn	1
she	1
gave	1
herself	1
a	1
push	1
off	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
skated	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
shtcherbatsky	1
clutching	1
at	1
his	1
arm	1
she	1
nodded	1
smiling	1
to	1
levin	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
splendid	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
imagined	1
her	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
he	1
could	1
call	1
up	1
a	1
vivid	1
picture	1
of	1
her	1
to	1
himself	1
especially	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
that	1
little	1
fair	1
head	1
so	1
freely	1
set	1
on	1
the	1
shapely	1
girlish	1
shoulders	1
and	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
childish	1
brightness	1
and	1
good	1
humor	1
the	1
childishness	1
of	1
her	1
expression	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
delicate	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
figure	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
special	1
charm	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
fully	1
realized	1
but	1
what	1
always	1
struck	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
as	1
something	1
unlooked	1
for	1
was	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
soft	1
serene	1
and	1
truthful	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
her	1
smile	1
which	1
always	1
transported	1
levin	1
to	1
an	1
enchanted	1
world	1
where	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
softened	1
and	1
tender	1
as	1
he	1
remembered	1
himself	1
in	1
some	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
early	1
childhood	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
she	1
said	1
giving	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
thank	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
as	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
muff	1
i	1
i	1
ve	1
not	1
long	1
yesterday	1
i	1
mean	1
today	1
i	1
arrived	1
answered	1
levin	1
in	1
his	1
emotion	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
understanding	1
her	1
question	1
i	1
was	1
meaning	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
then	1
recollecting	1
with	1
what	1
intention	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
promptly	1
overcome	1
with	1
confusion	1
and	1
blushed	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
could	1
skate	1
and	1
skate	1
so	1
well	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
earnestly	1
as	1
though	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
confusion	1
your	1
praise	1
is	1
worth	1
having	1
the	1
tradition	1
is	1
kept	1
up	1
here	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
skaters	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
black	1
gloved	1
hand	1
brushing	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
hoarfrost	1
off	1
her	1
muff	1
yes	1
i	1
used	1
once	1
to	1
skate	1
with	1
passion	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
reach	1
perfection	1
you	1
do	1
everything	1
with	1
passion	1
i	1
think	1
she	1
said	1
smiling	1
i	1
should	1
so	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
how	1

he	1
tightening	1
the	1
strap	1

answered	1
levin	1
with	1
difficulty	1
restraining	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
rapture	1
which	1
would	1
overspread	1
his	1
face	1
yes	1
he	1
thought	1

	1
she	1

levin	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
overcoat	1
and	1
scurrying	1
over	1
the	1
rough	1
ice	1
round	1
the	1
hut	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
smooth	1
ice	1
and	1
skated	1
without	1
effort	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
simple	1
exercise	1
of	1
will	1
increasing	1
and	1
slackening	1
speed	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
course	1
he	1
approached	1
with	1
timidity	1
but	1
again	1
her	1
smile	1
reassured	1
him	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
off	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
going	1
faster	1
and	1
faster	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
rapidly	1
they	1
moved	1
the	1
more	1
tightly	1
she	1
grasped	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
should	1
soon	1
learn	1
i	1
somehow	1
feel	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1

said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
myself	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
leaning	1
on	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
panic	1
stricken	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
blushed	1
and	1
indeed	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
like	1
the	1
sun	1
going	1
behind	1
a	1
cloud	1
her	1
face	1
lost	1
all	1
its	1
friendliness	1
and	1
levin	1
detected	1
the	1
familiar	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
expression	1
that	1
denoted	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
thought	1
a	1
crease	1
showed	1
on	1
her	1
smooth	1
brow	1
is	1
there	1
anything	1
troubling	1
you	1
though	1
i	1

to	1

he	1
added	1
hurriedly	1
oh	1
why	1
so	1
no	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
trouble	1
me	1
she	1
responded	1
coldly	1
and	1
she	1
added	1
immediately	1
you	1
haven	1
t	1

thought	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
flew	1
towards	1
the	1
old	1
frenchwoman	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
ringlets	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
smiling	1
and	1
showing	1
her	1
false	1
teeth	1
she	1
greeted	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
yes	1
you	1
see	1
we	1
re	1
growing	1
up	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
glancing	1
towards	1
kitty	1
and	1
growing	1
old	1
tiny	1
bear	1
has	1
grown	1
big	1
now	1
pursued	1
the	1
frenchwoman	1
laughing	1
and	1
she	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
joke	1
about	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
bears	1
in	1
the	1
english	1
nursery	1
tale	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
he	1
remembered	1
absolutely	1
nothing	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
joke	1
for	1
ten	1
years	1
now	1
and	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
it	1
now	1
go	1
and	1
skate	1

and	1
skate	1
our	1
kitty	1

learned	1
to	1

nicely	1
hasn	1
t	1
she	1
when	1
levin	1
darted	1
up	1
to	1
kitty	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
stern	1
her	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sincerity	1
and	1
friendliness	1
but	1
levin	1
fancied	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
friendliness	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
note	1
of	1
deliberate	1
composure	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
depressed	1
after	1
talking	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
governess	1
and	1
her	1
peculiarities	1
she	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
life	1
surely	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
dull	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1

she	1
said	1
no	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
dull	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
busy	1
he	1
said	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
him	1
in	1
check	1
by	1
her	1
composed	1
tone	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
force	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
town	1
long	1
kitty	1
questioned	1
him	1
i	1
don	1
t	1

he	1
answered	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
held	1
in	1
check	1
by	1
her	1
tone	1
of	1
quiet	1
friendliness	1
he	1
would	1
end	1
by	1
going	1
back	1
again	1
without	1
deciding	1
anything	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
struggle	1
against	1
it	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
i	1
don	1

know	1
it	1
depends	1
upon	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
horror	1
stricken	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
words	1
or	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
them	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
stumble	1
twice	1
struck	1
out	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
skated	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
skated	1
up	1
to	1
mlle	1
linon	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
pavilion	1
where	1
the	1
ladies	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
skates	1
my	1

said	1
levin	1
praying	1
inwardly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
feeling	1
a	1
need	1
of	1
violent	1
exercise	1
he	1
skated	1
about	1
describing	1
inner	1
and	1
outer	1
circles	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
skaters	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coffee	1
house	1
in	1
his	1
skates	1
with	1
a	1
cigarette	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
taking	1
a	1
run	1
he	1
dashed	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
in	1
his	1
skates	1
crashing	1
and	1
bounding	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
he	1
flew	1
down	1
and	1
without	1
even	1
changing	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
skated	1
away	1
over	1
the	1
ice	1
ah	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
new	1
trick	1
said	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
promptly	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
do	1
this	1

trick	1

shouted	1
after	1
him	1
levin	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
steps	1
took	1
a	1
run	1
from	1
above	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
dashed	1
down	1
preserving	1
his	1
balance	1
in	1
this	1
unwonted	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
step	1
he	1
stumbled	1
but	1
barely	1
touching	1
the	1
ice	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
violent	1
effort	1
recovered	1
himself	1
and	1
skated	1
off	1
laughing	1
how	1
splendid	1
how	1
nice	1
he	1
is	1
kitty	1
was	1
thinking	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pavilion	1
with	1
mlle	1
linon	1
and	1
looked	1
towards	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
quiet	1
affection	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
favorite	1
brother	1
and	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
my	1
fault	1
can	1
i	1

talk	1
of	1
flirtation	1
i	1
know	1

not	1
he	1
that	1
i	1
love	1
but	1
still	1
i	1
am	1
happy	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
jolly	1
only	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
mused	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
kitty	1
going	1
away	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
meeting	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
steps	1
levin	1
flushed	1
from	1
his	1
rapid	1
exercise	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
pondered	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
skates	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
daughter	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
gardens	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
said	1
princess	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
on	1

today	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
the	1
princess	1
said	1
stiffly	1
this	1
stiffness	1
hurt	1
kitty	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
coldness	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
till	1
this	1
evening	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
his	1
hat	1
cocked	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
with	1
beaming	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
strode	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
like	1
a	1
conquering	1
hero	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
his	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
he	1
responded	1
in	1
a	1
mournful	1
and	1
crestfallen	1
tone	1
to	1
her	1
inquiries	1
about	1
dolly	1
s	1
health	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
subdued	1
and	1
dejected	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
he	1
threw	1
out	1
his	1
chest	1
again	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
arm	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
well	1
shall	1
we	1
set	1
off	1
he	1
asked	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
you	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
air	1
yes	1
come	1
along	1
answered	1
levin	1
in	1
ecstasy	1
hearing	1
unceasingly	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
that	1
voice	1
saying	1
good	1
bye	1
till	1
this	1
evening	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
england	1

the	1
hermitage	1

which	1
all	1
right	1
then	1
the	1
england	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
selecting	1
that	1
restaurant	1
because	1
he	1
owed	1
more	1
there	1
than	1
at	1
the	1
hermitage	1
and	1
consequently	1
considered	1
it	1
mean	1
to	1
avoid	1
it	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
a	1
sledge	1
that	1
s	1
first	1
rate	1
for	1
i	1
sent	1
my	1
carriage	1
home	1
the	1
friends	1
hardly	1
spoke	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
levin	1
was	1
wondering	1
what	1
that	1
change	1
in	1
kitty	1
s	1
expression	1
had	1
meant	1
and	1
alternately	1
assuring	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
hope	1
and	1
falling	1
into	1
despair	1
seeing	1
clearly	1
that	1
his	1
hopes	1
were	1
insane	1
and	1
yet	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
quite	1
another	1
man	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
those	1
words	1
good	1
bye	1
till	1
this	1
evening	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
absorbed	1
during	1
the	1
drive	1
in	1
composing	1
the	1
menu	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1

like	1

were	1

when	1
levin	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
restaurant	1
with	1
oblonsky	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
noticing	1
a	1
certain	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
expression	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
restrained	1
radiance	1
about	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
whole	1
figure	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
oblonsky	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
overcoat	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
over	1
one	1
ear	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
giving	1
directions	1
to	1
the	1
tatar	1
waiters	1
who	1
were	1
clustered	1
about	1
him	1
in	1
evening	1
coats	1
bearing	1
napkins	1
bowing	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
met	1
and	1
here	1
as	1
everywhere	1
joyously	1
greeting	1
acquaintances	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sideboard	1
for	1
a	1
preliminary	1
appetizer	1
of	1
fish	1
and	1
vodka	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
painted	1
frenchwoman	1
decked	1
in	1
ribbons	1
lace	1
and	1
ringlets	1
behind	1
the	1
counter	1
something	1
so	1
amusing	1
that	1
even	1
that	1
frenchwoman	1
was	1
moved	1
to	1
genuine	1
laughter	1
levin	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
refrained	1
from	1
taking	1
any	1
vodka	1
simply	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
such	1
a	1
loathing	1
of	1
that	1
frenchwoman	1
all	1
made	1
up	1
it	1
seemed	1
of	1
false	1

made	1
haste	1
to	1
move	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
dirty	1
place	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
memories	1
of	1
kitty	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
triumph	1
and	1
happiness	1
shining	1
in	1

a	1
particularly	1
pertinacious	1
white	1
headed	1
old	1
tatar	1
with	1
immense	1
hips	1
and	1
coat	1

gaping	1
widely	1
behind	1
walk	1
in	1
your	1
excellency	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
levin	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
showing	1
his	1
respect	1
to	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
being	1
attentive	1
to	1
his	1
guest	1
as	1
well	1
instantly	1
flinging	1
a	1
fresh	1
cloth	1
over	1
the	1
round	1
table	1
under	1
the	1
bronze	1
chandelier	1
though	1
it	1
already	1
had	1
a	1
table	1
cloth	1
on	1
it	1
he	1
pushed	1
up	1
velvet	1
chairs	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
before	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
napkin	1
and	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
fare	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
awaiting	1
his	1
commands	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
it	1
your	1

lady	1
fresh	1
oysters	1
have	1
come	1
in	1
ah	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
became	1
thoughtful	1
how	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
change	1
our	1
program	1
levin	1
he	1
said	1
keeping	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
bill	1
of	1
fare	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
expressed	1
serious	1
hesitation	1
are	1
the	1
oysters	1
good	1
mind	1
now	1
they	1
re	1
flensburg	1
your	1

ostend	1
flensburg	1
will	1
do	1
but	1
are	1
they	1
fresh	1
only	1
arrived	1
yesterday	1
well	1
then	1
how	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
begin	1
with	1
oysters	1
and	1
so	1
change	1
the	1
whole	1
program	1
eh	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
cabbage	1
soup	1
and	1
porridge	1
better	1
than	1
anything	1
but	1
of	1

there	1
s	1
nothing	1
like	1
that	1
here	1
porridge	1
à	1
la	1

	1
your	1
honor	1
would	1
like	1
said	1
the	1
tatar	1
bending	1
down	1
to	1
levin	1
like	1
a	1
nurse	1
speaking	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
no	1
joking	1
apart	1
whatever	1
you	1
choose	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
skating	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
hungry	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
imagine	1
he	1
added	1
detecting	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
on	1
oblonsky	1
s	1
face	1
that	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1
appreciate	1
your	1

so	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
s	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
life	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
well	1
then	1
my	1
friend	1
you	1
give	1
us	1
two	1
or	1
better	1
say	1
three	1
dozen	1
oysters	1
clear	1
soup	1
with	1
vegetables	1
printanière	1
	1
prompted	1
the	1
tatar	1
but	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
apparently	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
allow	1
him	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
giving	1
the	1
french	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
dishes	1
with	1
vegetables	1
in	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
then	1
turbot	1
with	1
thick	1
sauce	1
then	1
roast	1
beef	1
and	1
mind	1
it	1
s	1
good	1
yes	1
and	1
capons	1
perhaps	1
and	1
then	1
sweets	1
the	1
tatar	1
recollecting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
way	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
dishes	1
by	1
the	1
names	1
in	1
the	1
french	1
bill	1
of	1
fare	1
did	1
not	1
repeat	1
them	1
after	1
him	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
rehearsing	1
the	1
whole	1
menu	1
to	1
himself	1
according	1
to	1
the	1

then	1
instantly	1
as	1
though	1
worked	1
by	1
springs	1
laying	1
down	1
one	1
bound	1
bill	1
of	1
fare	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
another	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
wines	1
and	1
submitted	1
it	1
to	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
drink	1
what	1
you	1
like	1
only	1
not	1
too	1

i	1
dare	1
say	1
do	1

like	1
the	1
white	1
seal	1
cachet	1
blanc	1
	1
prompted	1
the	1
tatar	1
very	1
well	1
then	1
give	1
us	1
that	1
brand	1
with	1
the	1
oysters	1

s	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
levin	1
unable	1
to	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
the	1
tatar	1
ran	1
off	1
with	1
flying	1
coat	1
tails	1
and	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
darted	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
dish	1
of	1
opened	1
oysters	1
on	1
mother	1
of	1
pearl	1
shells	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
between	1
his	1
fingers	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
crushed	1
the	1
starchy	1
napkin	1
tucked	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
settling	1
his	1
arms	1
comfortably	1
started	1
on	1
the	1
oysters	1
not	1
bad	1
he	1
said	1
stripping	1
the	1
oysters	1
from	1
the	1
pearly	1
shell	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
fork	1
and	1
swallowing	1
them	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
not	1
bad	1
he	1
repeated	1
turning	1
his	1
dewy	1
brilliant	1
eyes	1
from	1
levin	1
to	1
the	1
tatar	1
levin	1
ate	1
the	1
oysters	1
indeed	1
though	1
white	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese	1
would	1
have	1
pleased	1
him	1
better	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
admiring	1
oblonsky	1
even	1
the	1
tatar	1
uncorking	1
the	1
bottle	1
and	1
pouring	1
the	1
sparkling	1
wine	1
into	1
the	1
delicate	1
glasses	1
glanced	1
at	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
and	1
settled	1
his	1
white	1
cravat	1
with	1
a	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
much	1
for	1
oysters	1
do	1
you	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
emptying	1
his	1
wine	1
glass	1
or	1
you	1
re	1
worried	1
about	1
something	1
eh	1
he	1
wanted	1
levin	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
levin	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
he	1
was	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
he	1
felt	1
sore	1
and	1
uncomfortable	1
in	1
the	1
restaurant	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
private	1
rooms	1
where	1
men	1
were	1
dining	1
with	1
ladies	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
fuss	1
and	1
bustle	1
the	1
surroundings	1
of	1
bronzes	1
looking	1
glasses	1
gas	1
and	1
waiters	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
offensive	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
sullying	1
what	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
brimful	1
of	1
i	1
yes	1
i	1
am	1
but	1
besides	1
all	1
this	1
bothers	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
conceive	1
how	1
queer	1
it	1
all	1
seems	1
to	1
a	1
country	1
person	1
like	1
me	1
as	1
queer	1
as	1
that	1
gentleman	1
s	1
nails	1
i	1
saw	1
at	1
your	1
place	1
yes	1
i	1
saw	1
how	1
much	1
interested	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
poor	1
grinevitch	1
s	1
nails	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
laughing	1
it	1
s	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
me	1
responded	1
levin	1
do	1
try	1
now	1
and	1
put	1
yourself	1
in	1
my	1
place	1
take	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
person	1
we	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
try	1
to	1
bring	1
our	1
hands	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
convenient	1
for	1
working	1
with	1
so	1
we	1
cut	1
our	1
nails	1
sometimes	1
we	1
turn	1
up	1
our	1
sleeves	1
and	1
here	1
people	1
purposely	1
let	1
their	1
nails	1
grow	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
and	1
link	1
on	1
small	1
saucers	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
studs	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
gaily	1
oh	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
do	1
coarse	1
work	1
his	1
work	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
mind	1
maybe	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
s	1
queer	1
to	1
me	1
just	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
it	1
seems	1
queer	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
we	1
country	1
folks	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
our	1
meals	1
over	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
our	1
work	1
while	1
here	1
are	1
we	1
trying	1
to	1
drag	1
out	1
our	1
meal	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
object	1
eating	1
oysters	1
why	1
of	1
course	1
objected	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
civilization	1
to	1
make	1
everything	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
well	1
if	1
that	1
s	1
its	1
aim	1
i	1
d	1
rather	1
be	1
a	1
savage	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
savage	1
all	1
you	1
levins	1
are	1
savages	1
levin	1
sighed	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
and	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
and	1
sore	1
and	1
he	1
scowled	1
but	1
oblonsky	1
began	1
speaking	1
of	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
at	1
once	1
drew	1
his	1
attention	1
oh	1
i	1
say	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
tonight	1
to	1
our	1
people	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
i	1
mean	1
he	1
said	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkling	1
significantly	1
as	1
he	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
empty	1
rough	1
shells	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
cheese	1
towards	1
him	1
yes	1
i	1
shall	1
certainly	1
go	1
replied	1
levin	1
though	1
i	1
fancied	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
warm	1
in	1
her	1
invitation	1
what	1
nonsense	1
that	1

that	1

the	1
sudden	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
vanished	1
from	1
moscow	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
were	1
continually	1
asking	1
me	1
about	1
you	1
as	1
though	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
i	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
always	1
do	1
what	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
does	1
yes	1
said	1
levin	1
slowly	1
and	1
with	1
emotion	1
you	1
re	1

i	1
am	1
a	1
savage	1
only	1
my	1
savageness	1

i	1
have	1
come	1
oh	1
what	1
a	1
lucky	1
fellow	1
you	1
are	1
broke	1
in	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
looking	1
into	1
levin	1

eyes	1
why	1
i	1
know	1
a	1
gallant	1
steed	1
by	1
tokens	1

and	1
by	1

before	1

it	1
over	1
for	1
you	1

over	1
exactly	1
but	1
the	1
future	1
is	1
yours	1
and	1
the	1
present	1
is	1
mine	1
and	1
the	1
present	1
well	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
how	1
so	1
oh	1
things	1
go	1
wrong	1
but	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
besides	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
explain	1
it	1

said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
well	1
why	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
moscow	1
then	1
hi	1
take	1
away	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
tatar	1
you	1
guess	1
responded	1
levin	1
his	1
eyes	1
like	1
deep	1
wells	1
of	1
light	1
fixed	1
on	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
i	1
guess	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
by	1
that	1
whether	1
i	1
guess	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
gazing	1
at	1
levin	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
levin	1
in	1
a	1
quivering	1
voice	1
feeling	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
were	1
quivering	1
too	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
question	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
slowly	1
emptied	1
his	1
glass	1
of	1
chablis	1
never	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
levin	1
i	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
i	1
desire	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
nothing	1

would	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
be	1

making	1
a	1
mistake	1

him	1
with	1
his	1

evident	1

to	1
the	1

nothing	1

him	1

other	1
side	1

but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
state	1
the	1
principal	1
point	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
match	1
for	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
that	1
levin	1

right	1
when	1
vronsky	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
delighted	1
confirmed	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
that	1
kitty	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
not	1
simply	1
a	1
good	1
but	1
a	1
brilliant	1
match	1

disliked	1

strange	1

uncompromising	1
opinions	1

his	1
shyness	1
in	1
society	1
founded	1
as	1
she	1
supposed	1
on	1
his	1
pride	1
and	1
his	1
queer	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
absorbed	1
in	1
cattle	1
and	1
peasants	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
kept	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1

waiting	1

might	1
be	1
doing	1
them	1
too	1
great	1
an	1
honor	1
by	1
making	1
an	1

did	1
not	1

continually	1
visits	1

house	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
young	1

bound	1
to	1

suddenly	1
without	1

he	1
disappeared	1

not	1

enough	1
for	1

consequently	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
the	1
seriousness	1
of	1
his	1
intentions	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
the	1

had	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1

and	1

ascertained	1
and	1
communicated	1
their	1
mutual	1
impression	1
that	1
impression	1
had	1
been	1
favorable	1
afterwards	1
on	1
a	1
day	1
fixed	1
beforehand	1
the	1
expected	1
offer	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
her	1
parents	1
and	1
accepted	1
all	1
had	1
passed	1
very	1
simply	1
and	1
easily	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
but	1
over	1
her	1
own	1
daughters	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
how	1
far	1
from	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
is	1
the	1
business	1
apparently	1
so	1
commonplace	1
of	1
marrying	1
off	1
one	1
s	1
daughters	1
the	1
panics	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
lived	1
through	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brooded	1
over	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
wasted	1
and	1
the	1
disputes	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
over	1
marrying	1
the	1
two	1
elder	1
girls	1
darya	1
and	1
natalia	1
now	1
since	1
the	1
youngest	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
same	1
terrors	1
the	1
same	1
doubts	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
violent	1
quarrels	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
over	1
the	1
elder	1
girls	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
like	1
all	1
fathers	1
indeed	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
punctilious	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
the	1
honor	1
and	1
reputation	1
of	1
his	1
daughters	1
he	1
was	1
irrationally	1
jealous	1
over	1
his	1
daughters	1
especially	1
over	1
kitty	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
favorite	1
at	1
every	1
turn	1
he	1
had	1
scenes	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
for	1
compromising	1
her	1
daughter	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
grown	1
accustomed	1
to	1
this	1
already	1
with	1
her	1
other	1
daughters	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
more	1
ground	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
touchiness	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
much	1
was	1
changed	1
in	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
society	1
that	1
a	1
mother	1
s	1
duties	1
had	1
become	1
still	1
more	1
difficult	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
girls	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
age	1
formed	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
clubs	1
went	1
to	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
lectures	1
mixed	1
freely	1
in	1
men	1
s	1
society	1
drove	1
about	1
the	1
streets	1
alone	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
did	1
not	1
curtsey	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
thing	1
all	1
the	1
girls	1
were	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
husbands	1
was	1
their	1
own	1
affair	1
and	1
not	1
their	1
parents	1
marriages	1
aren	1
t	1
made	1
nowadays	1
as	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
was	1
thought	1
and	1
said	1
by	1
all	1
these	1
young	1
girls	1
and	1
even	1
by	1
their	1
elders	1
but	1
how	1
marriages	1
were	1
made	1
now	1
the	1
princess	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
from	1
anyone	1
the	1
french	1
fashion	1

by	1
the	1

how	1

it	1
s	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
have	1
to	1
marry	1
and	1
not	1
their	1
parents	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
to	1
arrange	1
it	1
as	1
they	1
choose	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
easy	1
for	1
anyone	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
daughters	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
realized	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
each	1
other	1
her	1
daughter	1
might	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
someone	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
or	1
who	1
was	1
quite	1
unfit	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
however	1
much	1
it	1
was	1
instilled	1
into	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
in	1
our	1
times	1
young	1
people	1
ought	1
to	1
arrange	1
their	1
lives	1
for	1
themselves	1
she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
whatever	1
the	1
most	1
suitable	1
playthings	1
for	1
children	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
loaded	1
pistols	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
more	1
uneasy	1
over	1
kitty	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
over	1
her	1
elder	1
sisters	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
vronsky	1
might	1
confine	1
himself	1
to	1
simply	1
flirting	1
with	1
her	1
daughter	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
herself	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
honorable	1
man	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
knew	1
how	1
easy	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
manners	1
of	1
today	1
to	1
turn	1
a	1
girl	1
s	1
head	1
and	1
how	1
lightly	1
men	1
generally	1
regard	1
such	1
a	1
crime	1
the	1
week	1
before	1
kitty	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
mother	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
she	1
had	1
with	1
vronsky	1
during	1
a	1
mazurka	1
this	1
conversation	1
had	1
partly	1
reassured	1
the	1
princess	1
but	1
perfectly	1
at	1
ease	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
vronsky	1
had	1
told	1
kitty	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
were	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
obeying	1
their	1
mother	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
made	1
up	1
their	1
minds	1
to	1
any	1
important	1
undertaking	1
without	1
consulting	1
her	1
and	1
just	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
impatiently	1
awaiting	1
my	1
mother	1
s	1
arrival	1
from	1
petersburg	1
as	1
peculiarly	1
fortunate	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
kitty	1
had	1
repeated	1
this	1
without	1
attaching	1
any	1
significance	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
but	1
her	1
mother	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
light	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
was	1
expected	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
pleased	1
at	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
choice	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
strange	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
his	1
offer	1
through	1
fear	1
of	1
vexing	1
his	1
mother	1
however	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
anxious	1
for	1
the	1
marriage	1
itself	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
for	1
relief	1
from	1
her	1
fears	1
that	1
she	1
believed	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
bitter	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
unhappiness	1
of	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
dolly	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
leaving	1
her	1
husband	1
her	1
anxiety	1
over	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
her	1
youngest	1
daughter	1
s	1
fate	1
engrossed	1
all	1
her	1
feelings	1
today	1
with	1
levin	1
s	1
reappearance	1
a	1
fresh	1
source	1
of	1
anxiety	1
arose	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
who	1
had	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
as	1
she	1
fancied	1
a	1
feeling	1
for	1
levin	1
might	1
from	1
extreme	1
sense	1
of	1
honor	1
refuse	1
vronsky	1
and	1
that	1
levin	1
s	1
arrival	1
might	1
generally	1
complicate	1
and	1
delay	1
the	1
affair	1
so	1
near	1
being	1
concluded	1
why	1
has	1
he	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
the	1

from	1

chapter	1
13	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
kitty	1
was	1
feeling	1
a	1
sensation	1
akin	1
to	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
before	1
a	1
battle	1
her	1
heart	1
throbbed	1
violently	1
and	1
her	1
thoughts	1
would	1
not	1
rest	1
on	1
anything	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
evening	1
when	1
they	1
would	1
both	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
turning	1
point	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
continually	1
picturing	1
them	1
to	1
herself	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
each	1
separately	1
and	1
then	1
both	1
together	1
when	1
she	1
mused	1
on	1
the	1
past	1
she	1
dwelt	1
with	1
pleasure	1
with	1
tenderness	1
on	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
levin	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
childhood	1
and	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
friendship	1
with	1
her	1
dead	1
brother	1
gave	1
a	1
special	1
poetic	1
charm	1
to	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
felt	1
certain	1
was	1
flattering	1
and	1
delightful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
levin	1
in	1
her	1
memories	1
of	1
vronsky	1
there	1
always	1
entered	1
a	1
certain	1
element	1
of	1
awkwardness	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
well	1
bred	1
and	1
at	1
ease	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
false	1
note	1
not	1
in	1
vronsky	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
nice	1
but	1
in	1
herself	1
while	1
with	1
levin	1
she	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
simple	1
and	1
clear	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
directly	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
with	1
vronsky	1
there	1
arose	1
before	1
her	1
a	1
perspective	1
of	1
brilliant	1
happiness	1
with	1
levin	1
the	1
future	1
seemed	1
misty	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
upstairs	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
she	1
noticed	1
with	1
joy	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
good	1
days	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
complete	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
forces	1
she	1
needed	1
this	1
so	1
for	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
external	1
composure	1
and	1
free	1
grace	1
in	1
her	1
movements	1
at	1
half	1
past	1
seven	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
when	1
the	1
footman	1
announced	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
levin	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
kitty	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
seemed	1
to	1
rush	1
to	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
her	1
paleness	1
as	1
she	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
knew	1
beyond	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
early	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
alone	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
presented	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
different	1
aspect	1
only	1
then	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
did	1
not	1
affect	1
her	1
only	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
loved	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
that	1
moment	1
to	1
wound	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
she	1
liked	1
and	1
to	1
wound	1
him	1
cruelly	1
what	1
for	1
because	1
he	1
dear	1
fellow	1
loved	1
her	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
god	1
shall	1
i	1
myself	1
really	1
have	1
to	1
say	1

that	1

had	1
reached	1
the	1
door	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
his	1

said	1
to	1
herself	1
seeing	1
his	1
powerful	1
shy	1
figure	1
with	1
his	1
shining	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
she	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
though	1
imploring	1
him	1
to	1
spare	1
her	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
hand	1
it	1
s	1
not	1

too	1
early	1
he	1
said	1
glancing	1
round	1
the	1
empty	1
drawing	1
room	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
expectations	1
were	1
realized	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1
speaking	1
his	1
face	1
became	1
gloomy	1
oh	1
no	1
said	1
kitty	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
alone	1
he	1
began	1
not	1
sitting	1
down	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
courage	1
mamma	1
will	1
be	1
down	1
directly	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
tired	1
yesterday	1
she	1
talked	1
on	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
uttering	1
and	1
not	1
taking	1
her	1
supplicating	1
and	1
caressing	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
she	1
blushed	1
and	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
here	1
long	1
that	1
it	1
depended	1
on	1
you	1
she	1
dropped	1
her	1
head	1
lower	1
and	1
lower	1
not	1
knowing	1
herself	1
what	1
answer	1
she	1
should	1
make	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
coming	1

brought	1
out	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
but	1
feeling	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
thing	1
was	1
said	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1

looked	1
at	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
feeling	1
ecstasy	1
her	1
soul	1
was	1
flooded	1
with	1
happiness	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
anticipated	1
that	1
the	1
utterance	1
of	1
love	1
would	1
produce	1
such	1
a	1
powerful	1
effect	1
on	1
her	1
but	1
it	1
lasted	1
only	1
an	1
instant	1
she	1
remembered	1
vronsky	1
she	1
lifted	1
her	1
clear	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
and	1
seeing	1
his	1
desperate	1
face	1
she	1
answered	1
hastily	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
forgive	1
me	1
a	1
moment	1
ago	1
and	1
how	1
close	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
importance	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
how	1
aloof	1
and	1
remote	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
bowed	1
and	1
was	1
meaning	1
to	1
retreat	1

but	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
in	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
horror	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
them	1
alone	1
and	1
their	1
disturbed	1
faces	1
levin	1
bowed	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
kitty	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
nor	1
lift	1
her	1
eyes	1
thank	1
god	1
she	1
has	1
refused	1
him	1
thought	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
habitual	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
greeted	1
her	1
guests	1
on	1
thursdays	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
levin	1
about	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
waiting	1
for	1
other	1
visitors	1
to	1
arrive	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
retreat	1
unnoticed	1
five	1
minutes	1
later	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
married	1
the	1
preceding	1
winter	1
countess	1

she	1
was	1
a	1
thin	1
sallow	1
sickly	1
and	1
nervous	1
woman	1
with	1
brilliant	1
black	1
eyes	1
she	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
kitty	1
and	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
showed	1
itself	1
as	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
married	1
women	1
for	1
girls	1
always	1
does	1
in	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
match	1
for	1

after	1

own	1
ideal	1
of	1

she	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
marry	1
vronsky	1
levin	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
disliked	1
him	1
her	1
invariable	1
and	1
favorite	1
pursuit	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
consisted	1
in	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
do	1
like	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
looks	1
down	1
at	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
grandeur	1
or	1
breaks	1
off	1
his	1
learned	1
conversation	1
with	1
me	1
because	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
fool	1
or	1
is	1
condescending	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
like	1
that	1
so	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
condescending	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
bear	1
me	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
right	1
for	1
levin	1
actually	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
her	1
and	1
despised	1
her	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
proud	1
of	1
and	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
fine	1
characteristic	1
her	1
nervousness	1
her	1
delicate	1
contempt	1
and	1
indifference	1
for	1
everything	1
coarse	1
and	1
earthly	1
the	1
countess	1
nordston	1
and	1
levin	1
got	1
into	1
that	1
relation	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
not	1
seldom	1
seen	1
in	1
society	1
when	1
two	1
persons	1
who	1
remain	1
externally	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
despise	1
each	1
other	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
even	1
take	1
each	1
other	1
seriously	1
and	1
cannot	1
even	1
be	1
offended	1
by	1
each	1
other	1
the	1
countess	1
nordston	1
pounced	1
upon	1
levin	1
at	1
once	1
ah	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
so	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
our	1
corrupt	1
babylon	1
she	1
said	1
giving	1
him	1
her	1
tiny	1
yellow	1
hand	1
and	1
recalling	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
chanced	1
to	1
say	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
that	1
moscow	1
was	1
a	1
babylon	1
come	1
is	1
babylon	1
reformed	1
or	1
have	1
you	1
degenerated	1
she	1
added	1
glancing	1
with	1
a	1
simper	1
at	1
kitty	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
flattering	1
for	1
me	1
countess	1
that	1
you	1
remember	1
my	1
words	1
so	1
well	1
responded	1
levin	1
who	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
recovering	1
his	1
composure	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
habit	1
dropped	1
into	1
his	1
tone	1
of	1
joking	1
hostility	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
nordston	1
they	1
must	1
certainly	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
impression	1
on	1
you	1
oh	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
so	1
i	1
always	1
note	1
them	1
all	1
down	1
well	1
kitty	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
skating	1
again	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
kitty	1
awkward	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
levin	1
to	1
withdraw	1
now	1
it	1
would	1
still	1
have	1
been	1
easier	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
perpetrate	1
this	1
awkwardness	1
than	1
to	1
remain	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
see	1
kitty	1
who	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
and	1
avoided	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
getting	1
up	1
when	1
the	1
princess	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
addressed	1
him	1
shall	1
you	1
be	1
long	1
in	1

for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
the	1

glancing	1
at	1
his	1
stern	1
serious	1
face	1
he	1
isn	1
t	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
argumentative	1
mood	1
but	1
i	1
ll	1
draw	1
him	1
out	1
i	1
do	1
love	1
making	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
him	1
before	1

and	1
i	1

do	1
it	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
do	1
explain	1
to	1
me	1
please	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
such	1
things	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
our	1
village	1
of	1
kaluga	1
all	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
have	1
drunk	1
up	1
all	1
they	1
possessed	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
can	1
t	1
pay	1
us	1
any	1
rent	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
that	1
you	1
always	1
praise	1
the	1
peasants	1
so	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
another	1
lady	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
levin	1
got	1
up	1
excuse	1
me	1
countess	1
but	1
i	1
really	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
you	1
anything	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
behind	1
the	1
lady	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
vronsky	1
thought	1
levin	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
it	1
glanced	1
at	1
kitty	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
vronsky	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
levin	1
and	1
simply	1
from	1
the	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
grew	1
unconsciously	1
brighter	1
levin	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
that	1
man	1
knew	1
it	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
so	1
in	1
words	1
but	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
he	1
now	1
whether	1
for	1
good	1
or	1
for	1
ill	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
choose	1
but	1
remain	1
he	1
must	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
like	1
whom	1
she	1
loved	1
there	1
are	1
people	1
who	1
on	1
meeting	1
a	1
successful	1
rival	1
no	1
matter	1
in	1
what	1
are	1
at	1
once	1
disposed	1
to	1
turn	1
their	1
backs	1
on	1
everything	1
good	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
only	1
what	1
is	1
bad	1
there	1
are	1
people	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
who	1
desire	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
that	1
lucky	1
rival	1
the	1
qualities	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
outstripped	1
them	1
and	1
seek	1
with	1
a	1
throbbing	1
ache	1
at	1
heart	1
only	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
levin	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
class	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
finding	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
attractive	1
in	1
vronsky	1
it	1
was	1
apparent	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
vronsky	1
was	1
a	1
squarely	1
built	1
dark	1
man	1
not	1
very	1
tall	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
humored	1
handsome	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
calm	1
and	1
resolute	1
face	1
everything	1
about	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
figure	1
from	1
his	1
short	1
cropped	1
black	1
hair	1
and	1
freshly	1
shaven	1
chin	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
loosely	1
fitting	1
brand	1
new	1
uniform	1
was	1
simple	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
elegant	1
making	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
vronsky	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
kitty	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
her	1
his	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
shone	1
with	1
a	1
specially	1
tender	1
light	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
happy	1
and	1
modestly	1
triumphant	1
smile	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
bowing	1
carefully	1
and	1
respectfully	1
over	1
her	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
small	1
broad	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
greeting	1
and	1
saying	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
everyone	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
without	1
once	1
glancing	1
at	1
levin	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
taken	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1

levin	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
levin	1
count	1
alexey	1
kirillovitch	1
vronsky	1
vronsky	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
looking	1
cordially	1
at	1
levin	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
believe	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
dined	1
with	1
you	1
this	1
winter	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
his	1
simple	1
and	1
open	1
smile	1
but	1
you	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
left	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
despises	1
and	1
hates	1
town	1
and	1
us	1
townspeople	1
said	1
countess	1
nordston	1
my	1
words	1
must	1
make	1
a	1
deep	1
impression	1
on	1
you	1
since	1
you	1
remember	1
them	1
so	1
well	1
said	1
levin	1
and	1
suddenly	1
conscious	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
before	1
he	1
reddened	1
vronsky	1
looked	1
at	1
levin	1
and	1
countess	1
nordston	1
and	1
smiled	1
are	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
inquired	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
dull	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
dull	1
if	1
one	1
has	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
besides	1
one	1
s	1
not	1
dull	1
by	1
oneself	1
levin	1
replied	1
abruptly	1
i	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
said	1
vronsky	1
noticing	1
and	1
affecting	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
levin	1
s	1
tone	1
but	1
i	1
hope	1
count	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
always	1
said	1
countess	1
nordston	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
tried	1
for	1
long	1
i	1
experienced	1
a	1
queer	1
feeling	1
once	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
never	1
longed	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
russian	1
country	1
with	1
bast	1
shoes	1
and	1
peasants	1
as	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
spending	1
a	1
winter	1
with	1
my	1
mother	1
in	1
nice	1
nice	1
itself	1
is	1
dull	1
enough	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
indeed	1
naples	1
and	1
sorrento	1
are	1
only	1
pleasant	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
there	1
that	1
russia	1
comes	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
most	1
vividly	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
country	1
it	1
s	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
talked	1
on	1
addressing	1
both	1
kitty	1
and	1
levin	1
turning	1
his	1
serene	1
friendly	1
eyes	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
saying	1
obviously	1
just	1
what	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
noticing	1
that	1
countess	1
nordston	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
without	1
finishing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
and	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
conversation	1
did	1
not	1
flag	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
always	1
kept	1
in	1
reserve	1
in	1
case	1
a	1
subject	1
should	1
be	1
lacking	1
two	1
heavy	1
guns	1
the	1
relative	1
advantages	1
of	1
classical	1
and	1
of	1
modern	1
education	1
and	1
universal	1
military	1
service	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
move	1
out	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
while	1
countess	1
nordston	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
chaffing	1
levin	1
levin	1
wanted	1
to	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
saying	1
to	1
himself	1
every	1
instant	1
now	1
go	1
he	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
as	1
though	1
waiting	1
for	1
something	1
the	1
conversation	1
fell	1
upon	1
table	1
turning	1
and	1
spirits	1
and	1
countess	1
nordston	1
who	1
believed	1
in	1
spiritualism	1
began	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
marvels	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
ah	1
countess	1
you	1
really	1
must	1
take	1
me	1

vronsky	1
smiling	1
very	1
well	1
next	1
saturday	1
answered	1
countess	1
nordston	1
but	1
you	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
do	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
it	1
she	1
asked	1
levin	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
ask	1
me	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
i	1
shall	1
say	1
but	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
opinion	1
my	1
opinion	1
answered	1
levin	1
is	1
only	1
that	1
this	1
table	1
turning	1
simply	1
proves	1
that	1
educated	1
society	1
so	1
called	1
is	1
no	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
peasants	1
they	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
evil	1
eye	1
and	1
in	1
witchcraft	1
and	1
omens	1
while	1
we	1
oh	1
then	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
it	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
it	1
countess	1
but	1
if	1
i	1
ve	1
seen	1
it	1
myself	1
the	1
peasant	1
women	1
too	1
tell	1
us	1
they	1
have	1
seen	1
goblins	1
then	1
you	1
think	1
i	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
and	1
she	1
laughed	1
a	1
mirthless	1
laugh	1
oh	1
no	1
masha	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
it	1
said	1
kitty	1
blushing	1
for	1
levin	1
and	1
levin	1
saw	1
this	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
exasperated	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
but	1
vronsky	1
with	1
his	1
bright	1
frank	1
smile	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
which	1
was	1
threatening	1
to	1
become	1
disagreeable	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
conceivability	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
queried	1
but	1
why	1
not	1
we	1
admit	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
electricity	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
nothing	1
why	1
should	1
there	1
not	1
be	1
some	1
new	1
force	1
still	1
unknown	1
to	1
us	1
which	1
when	1
electricity	1
was	1
discovered	1
levin	1
interrupted	1
hurriedly	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
phenomenon	1
that	1
was	1
discovered	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
unknown	1
from	1
what	1
it	1
proceeded	1
and	1
what	1
were	1
its	1
effects	1
and	1
ages	1
passed	1
before	1
its	1
applications	1
were	1
conceived	1
but	1
the	1
spiritualists	1
have	1
begun	1
with	1
tables	1
writing	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
spirits	1
appearing	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
have	1
only	1
later	1
started	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unknown	1
force	1
vronsky	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
levin	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
listen	1
obviously	1
interested	1
in	1
his	1
words	1
yes	1
but	1
the	1
spiritualists	1
say	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
at	1
present	1
what	1
this	1
force	1
is	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
force	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
conditions	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
acts	1
let	1
the	1
scientific	1
men	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
force	1
consists	1
in	1
no	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
why	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
force	1
if	1
it	1
why	1
because	1
with	1
electricity	1
levin	1
interrupted	1
again	1
every	1
time	1
you	1
rub	1
tar	1
against	1
wool	1
a	1
recognized	1
phenomenon	1
is	1
manifested	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
happen	1
every	1
time	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
follows	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
natural	1
phenomenon	1
feeling	1
probably	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
taking	1
a	1
tone	1
too	1
serious	1
for	1
a	1
drawing	1
room	1
vronsky	1
made	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
but	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
trying	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
smiled	1
brightly	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
do	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
at	1
once	1
countess	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
levin	1
would	1
finish	1
saying	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
i	1
think	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
that	1
this	1
attempt	1
of	1
the	1
spiritualists	1
to	1
explain	1
their	1
marvels	1
as	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
new	1
natural	1
force	1
is	1
most	1
futile	1
they	1
boldly	1
talk	1
of	1
spiritual	1
force	1
and	1
then	1
try	1
to	1
subject	1
it	1
to	1
material	1
experiment	1
everyone	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
finish	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
first	1
rate	1
medium	1
said	1
countess	1
nordston	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
enthusiastic	1
in	1
you	1
levin	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
reddened	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
do	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
table	1
turning	1
at	1
once	1
please	1
said	1
vronsky	1
princess	1
will	1
you	1
allow	1
it	1
and	1
vronsky	1
stood	1
up	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
kitty	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
fetch	1
a	1
table	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
her	1
eyes	1
met	1
levin	1
s	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
heart	1
the	1
more	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
pitying	1
him	1
for	1
suffering	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
the	1
cause	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
forgive	1
me	1
forgive	1
me	1
said	1
her	1
eyes	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
happy	1
i	1
hate	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
myself	1
his	1
eyes	1
responded	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
hat	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
destined	1
to	1
escape	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
arranging	1
themselves	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
levin	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
retiring	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
after	1
greeting	1
the	1
ladies	1
addressed	1
levin	1
ah	1
he	1
began	1
joyously	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
my	1
boy	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
even	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
town	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
embraced	1
levin	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
observe	1
vronsky	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
was	1
serenely	1
waiting	1
till	1
the	1
prince	1
should	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
kitty	1
felt	1
how	1
distasteful	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
warmth	1
was	1
to	1
levin	1
after	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
she	1
saw	1
too	1
how	1
coldly	1
her	1
father	1
responded	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
vronsky	1
s	1
bow	1
and	1
how	1
vronsky	1
looked	1
with	1
amiable	1
perplexity	1
at	1
her	1
father	1
as	1
though	1
trying	1
and	1
failing	1
to	1
understand	1
how	1
and	1
why	1
anyone	1
could	1
be	1
hostilely	1
disposed	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
flushed	1
prince	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
said	1
countess	1
nordston	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
try	1
an	1
experiment	1
what	1
experiment	1
table	1
turning	1
well	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
but	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
fun	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
ring	1
game	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
looking	1
at	1
vronsky	1
and	1
guessing	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
suggestion	1
there	1
s	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
that	1
anyway	1
vronsky	1
looked	1
wonderingly	1
at	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
his	1
resolute	1
eyes	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
began	1
immediately	1
talking	1
to	1
countess	1
nordston	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
ball	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
off	1
next	1
week	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
there	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
kitty	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
levin	1
went	1
out	1
unnoticed	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
impression	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
the	1
smiling	1
happy	1
face	1
of	1
kitty	1
answering	1
vronsky	1
s	1
inquiry	1
about	1
the	1
ball	1
chapter	1
15	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
kitty	1
told	1
her	1
mother	1
of	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
levin	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
pity	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
levin	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
an	1
offer	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
acted	1
rightly	1
but	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
one	1
impression	1
pursued	1
her	1
relentlessly	1
it	1
was	1
levin	1
s	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
scowling	1
brows	1
and	1
his	1
kind	1
eyes	1
looking	1
out	1
in	1
dark	1
dejection	1
below	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
vronsky	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
immediately	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
for	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
up	1
she	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
his	1
manly	1
resolute	1
face	1
his	1
noble	1
self	1
possession	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
nature	1
conspicuous	1
in	1
everything	1
towards	1
everyone	1
she	1
remembered	1
the	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loved	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
all	1
was	1
gladness	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
she	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
pillow	1
smiling	1
with	1
happiness	1
i	1
m	1
sorry	1
i	1
m	1
sorry	1
but	1
what	1
could	1
i	1
do	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
but	1
an	1
inner	1
voice	1
told	1
her	1
something	1
else	1
whether	1
she	1
felt	1
remorse	1
at	1
having	1
won	1
levin	1
s	1
love	1
or	1
at	1
having	1
refused	1
him	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
her	1
happiness	1
was	1
poisoned	1
by	1
doubts	1

she	1
repeated	1
to	1
herself	1
till	1
she	1
fell	1
asleep	1
meanwhile	1
there	1
took	1
place	1
below	1
in	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
little	1
library	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
scenes	1
so	1
often	1
repeated	1
between	1
the	1
parents	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
favorite	1
daughter	1
what	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
wrapping	1
his	1
squirrel	1
lined	1
dressing	1
gown	1
round	1
him	1
again	1
that	1
you	1
ve	1
no	1
pride	1
no	1
dignity	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
disgracing	1
ruining	1
your	1
daughter	1
by	1
this	1
vulgar	1
stupid	1
matchmaking	1
but	1
really	1
for	1
mercy	1
s	1
sake	1
prince	1
what	1
have	1
i	1
done	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
almost	1
crying	1
she	1
pleased	1
and	1
happy	1
after	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
night	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
offer	1
and	1
kitty	1
s	1
refusal	1
still	1
she	1
hinted	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
she	1
fancied	1
things	1
were	1
practically	1
settled	1
with	1
vronsky	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
declare	1
himself	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
arrived	1
and	1
thereupon	1
at	1
those	1
words	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
flown	1
into	1
a	1
passion	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
use	1
unseemly	1
language	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
re	1
trying	1
to	1
catch	1
an	1
eligible	1
gentleman	1
and	1
all	1
moscow	1
will	1
be	1
talking	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
with	1
good	1
reason	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
evening	1
parties	1
invite	1
everyone	1
don	1
t	1
pick	1
out	1
the	1
possible	1
suitors	1
invite	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
bucks	1
engage	1
a	1
piano	1
player	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
dance	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
things	1
nowadays	1
hunting	1
up	1
good	1
matches	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
sick	1
sick	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
you	1
ve	1
gone	1
on	1
till	1
you	1
ve	1
turned	1
the	1
poor	1
wench	1
s	1
head	1
levin	1
s	1
a	1

by	1

at	1

how	1
we	1

for	1

she	1

really	1
got	1
the	1

at	1

at	1

of	1

he	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
visitor	1
at	1

to	1
her	1
as	1
people	1
commonly	1
do	1
talk	1
in	1
society	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
nonsense	1

nonsense	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
attaching	1
a	1
special	1
meaning	1
in	1
her	1

nothing	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1

was	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1

upon	1
him	1

the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
the	1

he	1

the	1
tenderer	1
was	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1

did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
mode	1
of	1
behavior	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
kitty	1
had	1
a	1
definite	1
character	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
courting	1
young	1
girls	1
with	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
marriage	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
courting	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
actions	1
common	1
among	1
brilliant	1
young	1
men	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
had	1
discovered	1
this	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
enjoying	1
his	1
discovery	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
her	1
parents	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
evening	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
put	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
kitty	1
would	1
be	1
unhappy	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
marry	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
greatly	1
astonished	1
and	1
would	1
not	1

gave	1
such	1
great	1
and	1
delicate	1
pleasure	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
her	1
could	1
be	1

still	1

could	1

have	1

that	1
he	1

to	1

marriage	1
had	1
never	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
possibility	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
disliked	1
family	1
life	1
but	1
a	1
family	1
and	1
especially	1
a	1
husband	1
was	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
views	1
general	1
in	1
the	1
bachelor	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lived	1
conceived	1
as	1
something	1
alien	1
repellant	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
ridiculous	1
but	1
though	1
vronsky	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
suspicion	1
what	1
the	1
parents	1
were	1
saying	1
he	1
felt	1
on	1
coming	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
that	1
the	1
secret	1
spiritual	1
bond	1
which	1
existed	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
kitty	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
much	1
stronger	1
that	1
evening	1
that	1
some	1
step	1
must	1
be	1
taken	1
but	1
what	1
step	1
could	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
is	1
so	1
exquisite	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
carrying	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
a	1
delicious	1
feeling	1
of	1
purity	1
and	1
freshness	1
arising	1
partly	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
smoking	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
evening	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
a	1
new	1
feeling	1
of	1
tenderness	1
at	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
what	1
is	1
so	1
exquisite	1
is	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
by	1
me	1
or	1
by	1
her	1
but	1
we	1
understand	1
each	1
other	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
this	1
unseen	1
language	1
of	1
looks	1
and	1
tones	1
that	1
this	1
evening	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
ever	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
she	1
loves	1
me	1
and	1
how	1
secretly	1
simply	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
how	1
trustfully	1
i	1
feel	1
myself	1
better	1
purer	1
i	1
feel	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
heart	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
good	1
in	1
me	1
those	1
sweet	1
loving	1
eyes	1
when	1
she	1
said	1
indeed	1
i	1
do	1
well	1
what	1
then	1
oh	1
nothing	1
it	1
s	1
good	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
wondering	1
where	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
passed	1
in	1
review	1
of	1
the	1
places	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
to	1

straight	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
at	1
dussots	1

ordered	1
supper	1
and	1
then	1
undressed	1

touched	1
the	1

oblonsky	1

who	1

shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1

just	1
as	1
he	1

before	1
to	1
levin	1
vronsky	1
smiled	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
deny	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
promptly	1
changed	1
the	1

vronsky	1
answered	1
heedlessly	1
with	1
a	1
vague	1
recollection	1
of	1
something	1
stiff	1
and	1
tedious	1
evoked	1
by	1

the	1
charm	1

in	1
general	1
for	1
everyone	1
vronsky	1
had	1
felt	1
of	1
late	1
specially	1
drawn	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1

the	1
approach	1
of	1

if	1

away	1

was	1
out	1

followed	1
the	1
guard	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
compartment	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
was	1
getting	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
insight	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
from	1
one	1
glance	1
at	1
this	1
lady	1
s	1
appearance	1
vronsky	1
classified	1
her	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
society	1
he	1
begged	1
pardon	1
and	1
was	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
but	1
felt	1
he	1
must	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
once	1
more	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
beautiful	1
not	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
elegance	1
and	1
modest	1
grace	1
which	1
were	1
apparent	1
in	1
her	1
whole	1
figure	1
but	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
charming	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
close	1
by	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
peculiarly	1
caressing	1
and	1
soft	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
she	1
too	1
turned	1
her	1
head	1
her	1
shining	1
gray	1
eyes	1
that	1
looked	1
dark	1
from	1
the	1
thick	1
lashes	1
rested	1
with	1
friendly	1
attention	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
recognizing	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
promptly	1
turned	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
passing	1
crowd	1
as	1
though	1
seeking	1
someone	1
in	1
that	1
brief	1
look	1
vronsky	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
suppressed	1
eagerness	1
which	1
played	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
flitted	1
between	1
the	1
brilliant	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
faint	1
smile	1
that	1
curved	1
her	1
red	1
lips	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
her	1
nature	1
were	1
so	1
brimming	1
over	1
with	1
something	1
that	1
against	1
her	1
will	1
it	1
showed	1
itself	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
flash	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
now	1
in	1
her	1
smile	1
deliberately	1
she	1
shrouded	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
it	1
shone	1
against	1
her	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
faintly	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
vronsky	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
his	1
mother	1
a	1
dried	1
up	1
old	1
lady	1
with	1
black	1
eyes	1
and	1
ringlets	1
screwed	1
up	1
her	1
eyes	1
scanning	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
smiled	1
slightly	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
lips	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
handing	1
her	1
maid	1
a	1
bag	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
little	1
wrinkled	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
to	1
kiss	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
from	1

her	1
son	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
listening	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
voice	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
the	1

send	1
him	1
to	1

said	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
and	1
stepped	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
compartment	1

found	1

that	1

said	1
standing	1
up	1
excuse	1
me	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
and	1
indeed	1
our	1
acquaintance	1
was	1
so	1
slight	1
said	1
vronsky	1
bowing	1
that	1
no	1
doubt	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
me	1
oh	1
no	1
said	1
she	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
because	1
your	1
mother	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
talking	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
she	1
let	1
the	1
eagerness	1
that	1
would	1
insist	1
on	1
coming	1
out	1
show	1
itself	1
in	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
still	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
do	1
call	1
him	1
alexey	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
vronsky	1
stepped	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
shouted	1
oblonsky	1
here	1
madame	1
karenina	1
however	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
but	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
stepped	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
light	1
resolute	1
step	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
her	1
brother	1
had	1
reached	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
that	1
struck	1
vronsky	1
by	1
its	1
decision	1
and	1
its	1
grace	1
she	1
flung	1
her	1
left	1
arm	1
around	1
his	1
neck	1
drew	1
him	1
rapidly	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
warmly	1
vronsky	1
gazed	1
never	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
smiled	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
why	1
but	1
recollecting	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
the	1

the	1
world	1
with	1

you	1
are	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
delightful	1
women	1
in	1
whose	1
company	1
it	1
s	1
sweet	1
to	1

madame	1
karenina	1
stood	1
quite	1
still	1
holding	1
herself	1
very	1
erect	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
smiling	1

arkadyevna	1
the	1
countess	1
said	1
in	1
explanation	1
to	1
her	1

a	1
little	1
son	1
eight	1
years	1
old	1
i	1

and	1
she	1
has	1
never	1

from	1
him	1
before	1
and	1
she	1
keeps	1
fretting	1
over	1
leaving	1
him	1
yes	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
talking	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
i	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
she	1
of	1
hers	1
said	1
madame	1
karenina	1
and	1
again	1
a	1
smile	1
lighted	1
up	1
her	1
face	1
a	1
caressing	1
smile	1
intended	1
for	1
him	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
dreadfully	1
bored	1
he	1
said	1
promptly	1
catching	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
coquetry	1
she	1
had	1
flung	1
him	1
but	1
apparently	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
that	1
strain	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
thank	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
passed	1
so	1
quickly	1
good	1

countess	1
good	1
bye	1
my	1
love	1
answered	1
the	1
countess	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
kiss	1
of	1
your	1
pretty	1
face	1
i	1
speak	1
plainly	1
at	1
my	1
age	1
and	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
simply	1
that	1
i	1
ve	1
lost	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
you	1
stereotyped	1
as	1
the	1
phrase	1
was	1
madame	1
karenina	1
obviously	1
believed	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
by	1
it	1
she	1
flushed	1
bent	1
down	1
slightly	1
and	1
put	1
her	1
cheek	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
s	1
lips	1
drew	1
herself	1
up	1
again	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
fluttering	1
between	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
vronsky	1
he	1
pressed	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
as	1
though	1
at	1
something	1
special	1
by	1
the	1
energetic	1
squeeze	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
freely	1
and	1
vigorously	1
shook	1
his	1
hand	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
rapid	1
step	1
which	1
bore	1
her	1
rather	1
fully	1
developed	1
figure	1
with	1
such	1
strange	1
lightness	1
very	1
charming	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
that	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
her	1
son	1
was	1
thinking	1
his	1
eyes	1
followed	1
her	1
till	1
her	1
graceful	1
figure	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
smile	1
remained	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
saw	1
out	1
of	1

sitting	1
in	1
the	1

with	1
a	1
white	1

fat	1
little	1
boy	1
already	1

him	1
a	1
lesson	1
in	1

kept	1
twisting	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
tear	1
off	1
a	1
button	1
that	1
was	1
nearly	1
off	1
his	1

his	1
mother	1

several	1

taken	1
his	1

the	1

long	1
been	1
making	1
she	1
always	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
it	1
at	1
depressed	1
moments	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
knitted	1
at	1
it	1
nervously	1
twitching	1
her	1
fingers	1
and	1
counting	1
the	1
stitches	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
sent	1
word	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
whether	1
his	1
sister	1
came	1
or	1
not	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
everything	1
ready	1
for	1
her	1
arrival	1
and	1
was	1
expecting	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
with	1
emotion	1
dolly	1
was	1
crushed	1
by	1
her	1
sorrow	1
utterly	1
swallowed	1
up	1
by	1
it	1
still	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
that	1
anna	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
personages	1
in	1
petersburg	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
petersburg	1
grande	1
dame	1
and	1
thanks	1
to	1
this	1
circumstance	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
out	1
her	1
threat	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
coming	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
anna	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
to	1
blame	1
thought	1
dolly	1
i	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
her	1
except	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
nothing	1
but	1
kindness	1
and	1
affection	1
from	1
her	1
towards	1
myself	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
recall	1
her	1
impressions	1
at	1
petersburg	1
at	1
the	1
karenins	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
their	1
household	1
itself	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
artificial	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
framework	1
of	1
their	1
family	1
life	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
i	1
not	1
receive	1
her	1
if	1
only	1
she	1
doesn	1
t	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
console	1
me	1
thought	1
dolly	1
all	1
consolation	1
and	1
counsel	1
and	1
christian	1
forgiveness	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
thought	1
over	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
no	1
use	1
all	1
these	1
days	1
dolly	1
had	1
been	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
her	1
sorrow	1
but	1
with	1
that	1
sorrow	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
outside	1
matters	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
in	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
anna	1
everything	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
alternately	1
glad	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
speaking	1
freely	1
and	1
angry	1
at	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
speaking	1
of	1
her	1
humiliation	1
with	1
her	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
of	1
hearing	1
her	1
ready	1
made	1
phrases	1
of	1
good	1
advice	1
and	1
comfort	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
her	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1

every	1
minute	1
and	1
as	1
so	1
often	1
happens	1
let	1
slip	1
just	1
that	1
minute	1
when	1
her	1
visitor	1
arrived	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
bell	1
catching	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
skirts	1
and	1
light	1
steps	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
she	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
her	1
care	1
worn	1
face	1
unconsciously	1
expressed	1
not	1
gladness	1
but	1
wonder	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
embraced	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
what	1
here	1
already	1
she	1
said	1
as	1

kissed	1
her	1
dolly	1
how	1

to	1

said	1
dolly	1
faintly	1
smiling	1
and	1
trying	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
anna	1

face	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
she	1

i	1
lived	1
eight	1

so	1
far	1
from	1
suspecting	1

regarded	1
it	1
as	1
impossible	1
and	1
then	1
try	1
to	1
imagine	1
it	1
with	1
such	1
ideas	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
suddenly	1
all	1
the	1

in	1
it	1
i	1

carried	1
away	1
by	1
feeling	1

went	1
on	1

a	1
brief	1
silence	1

into	1
her	1

dolly	1
most	1
he	1
s	1
tortured	1
by	1
two	1
things	1
that	1
he	1

as	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
words	1
yes	1
i	1

see	1
that	1
his	1
position	1
is	1
awful	1
it	1
s	1
worse	1
for	1
the	1
guilty	1
than	1
the	1
innocent	1
she	1
said	1
if	1
he	1
feels	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
misery	1
comes	1
from	1
his	1
fault	1
but	1
how	1

i	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
how	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife	1
again	1
after	1
her	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
now	1
would	1
be	1
torture	1
just	1
because	1
i	1
love	1
my	1
past	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
sobs	1
cut	1
short	1
her	1
words	1

as	1
though	1
of	1
set	1
design	1
each	1
time	1
she	1
was	1
softened	1

him	1
as	1
stiva	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
relations	1
of	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
the	1
same	1
estrangement	1
still	1
remained	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
talk	1
now	1
of	1
separation	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
explanation	1
and	1
reconciliation	1
immediately	1
after	1
dinner	1
kitty	1
came	1
in	1
she	1
knew	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
but	1
only	1
very	1
slightly	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
now	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
with	1
some	1
trepidation	1
at	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
meeting	1
this	1
fashionable	1
petersburg	1
lady	1
whom	1
everyone	1
spoke	1
so	1
highly	1
of	1
but	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
favorable	1
impression	1
on	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
at	1
once	1
anna	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
admiring	1
her	1
loveliness	1
and	1
her	1
youth	1
before	1
kitty	1
knew	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
not	1
merely	1
under	1
anna	1
s	1
sway	1
but	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
young	1
girls	1
do	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
older	1
and	1
married	1
women	1
anna	1
was	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
fashionable	1
lady	1
nor	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
eight	1
years	1
old	1
in	1
the	1
elasticity	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
the	1
freshness	1
and	1
the	1
unflagging	1
eagerness	1
which	1
persisted	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
broke	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
glance	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
passed	1
for	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
twenty	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
a	1
serious	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
mournful	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
which	1
struck	1
and	1
attracted	1
kitty	1
kitty	1
felt	1
that	1
anna	1
was	1
perfectly	1
simple	1
and	1
was	1
concealing	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
another	1
higher	1
world	1
of	1
interests	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
her	1
complex	1
and	1
poetic	1
after	1
dinner	1
when	1
dolly	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
anna	1
rose	1
quickly	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
lighting	1
a	1
cigar	1
stiva	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
winking	1
gaily	1
crossing	1
him	1
and	1
glancing	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
go	1
and	1
god	1
help	1
you	1
he	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
cigar	1
understanding	1
her	1
and	1
departed	1
through	1
the	1
doorway	1
when	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
disappeared	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
sofa	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
children	1
either	1
because	1
the	1
children	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
this	1
aunt	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
felt	1
a	1
special	1
charm	1
in	1
her	1
themselves	1
the	1
two	1
elder	1
ones	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
following	1
their	1
lead	1
as	1
children	1
so	1
often	1
do	1
had	1
clung	1
about	1
their	1
new	1
aunt	1
since	1
before	1
dinner	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
game	1
among	1
them	1
to	1
sit	1
a	1
close	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
their	1
aunt	1
to	1
touch	1
her	1
hold	1
her	1
little	1
hand	1
kiss	1
it	1
play	1
with	1
her	1
ring	1
or	1
even	1
touch	1
the	1
flounce	1
of	1
her	1
skirt	1
come	1
come	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
sitting	1
before	1
said	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
and	1
again	1
grisha	1
poked	1
his	1
little	1
face	1
under	1
her	1
arm	1
and	1
nestled	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
her	1
gown	1
beaming	1
with	1
pride	1
and	1
happiness	1
and	1
when	1
is	1
your	1
next	1
ball	1
she	1
asked	1
kitty	1
next	1
week	1
and	1
a	1
splendid	1
ball	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
balls	1
where	1

why	1

where	1
one	1
always	1
enjoys	1
oneself	1
anna	1
said	1
with	1
tender	1
irony	1
it	1
s	1
strange	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
bobrishtchevs	1
one	1
always	1
enjoys	1
oneself	1
and	1
at	1

said	1
anna	1
and	1
kitty	1
detected	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
mysterious	1
world	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
open	1
to	1
her	1
for	1

some	1
less	1

ball	1
inquired	1
anna	1
kitty	1
perceived	1
that	1
anna	1
knew	1
what	1
answer	1
would	1
follow	1
because	1
you	1
always	1
look	1
nicer	1
than	1
anyone	1
anna	1
had	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
blushing	1
she	1
blushed	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
it	1
s	1
never	1
so	1
and	1
secondly	1
if	1
it	1

it	1
make	1
to	1
me	1

playing	1
with	1
i	1

from	1
her	1
and	1
sending	1
them	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
i	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
press	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
you	1
expect	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1

blue	1

the	1
mist	1
on	1
the	1
mountains	1
in	1
switzerland	1
that	1
mist	1
which	1
covers	1
everything	1
in	1
that	1
blissful	1
time	1
when	1
childhood	1
is	1
just	1
ending	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
vast	1
circle	1
happy	1
and	1
gay	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
path	1
growing	1
narrower	1
and	1
narrower	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
delightful	1
and	1
alarming	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
ballroom	1
bright	1
and	1
splendid	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
who	1
has	1
not	1

how	1

through	1
it	1
how	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1

vronsky	1
at	1
the	1
railway	1

gossiped	1
about	1
it	1

traveled	1
yesterday	1
with	1
vronsky	1
s	1
mother	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
talked	1
without	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
s	1
her	1
favorite	1
i	1
know	1
mothers	1
are	1
partial	1
but	1
what	1
did	1
his	1
mother	1
tell	1
you	1

great	1
deal	1
and	1
i	1

that	1

still	1
one	1
can	1
see	1
how	1
chivalrous	1
he	1
is	1
well	1
for	1

told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
his	1
property	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1

and	1
recollecting	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
kitty	1
about	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
it	1
was	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
something	1
that	1

this	1

into	1

the	1
ball	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
beginning	1
as	1
kitty	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
walked	1
up	1
the	1
great	1
staircase	1
flooded	1
with	1
light	1
and	1
lined	1
with	1
flowers	1
and	1
footmen	1
in	1
powder	1
and	1
red	1
coats	1
from	1
the	1
rooms	1
came	1
a	1
constant	1
steady	1
hum	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
hive	1
and	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
movement	1
and	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
landing	1
between	1
trees	1
they	1
gave	1
last	1
touches	1
to	1
their	1
hair	1
and	1
dresses	1
before	1
the	1
mirror	1
they	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
ballroom	1
the	1
careful	1
distinct	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
fiddles	1
of	1
the	1
orchestra	1
beginning	1
the	1
first	1
waltz	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
civilian	1
dress	1
arranging	1
his	1
gray	1
curls	1
before	1
another	1
mirror	1
and	1
diffusing	1
an	1
odor	1
of	1
scent	1
stumbled	1
against	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
stood	1
aside	1
evidently	1
admiring	1
kitty	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
a	1
beardless	1
youth	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
society	1
youths	1
whom	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
shtcherbatsky	1
called	1
young	1
bucks	1
in	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
open	1
waistcoat	1
straightening	1
his	1
white	1
tie	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
bowed	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
after	1
running	1
by	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
ask	1
kitty	1
for	1
a	1
quadrille	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
quadrille	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
vronsky	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
promise	1
this	1
youth	1
the	1
second	1
an	1
officer	1
buttoning	1
his	1
glove	1
stood	1
aside	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
and	1
stroking	1
his	1
mustache	1
admired	1
rosy	1
kitty	1
although	1
her	1
dress	1
her	1
coiffure	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
ball	1
had	1
cost	1
kitty	1
great	1
trouble	1
and	1
consideration	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
she	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
ballroom	1
in	1
her	1
elaborate	1
tulle	1
dress	1
over	1
a	1
pink	1
slip	1
as	1
easily	1
and	1
simply	1
as	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
rosettes	1
and	1
lace	1
all	1
the	1
minute	1
details	1
of	1
her	1
attire	1
had	1
not	1
cost	1
her	1
or	1
her	1
family	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
attention	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
in	1
that	1
tulle	1
and	1
lace	1
with	1
her	1
hair	1
done	1
up	1
high	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
rose	1
and	1
two	1
leaves	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
just	1
before	1
entering	1
the	1
ballroom	1
the	1
princess	1
her	1
mother	1
tried	1
to	1
turn	1
right	1
side	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ribbon	1
of	1
her	1
sash	1
kitty	1
had	1
drawn	1
back	1
a	1
little	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
must	1
be	1
right	1
of	1
itself	1
and	1
graceful	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
need	1
setting	1
straight	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
best	1
days	1
her	1
dress	1
was	1
not	1
uncomfortable	1
anywhere	1
her	1
lace	1
berthe	1
did	1
not	1
droop	1
anywhere	1
her	1
rosettes	1
were	1
not	1
crushed	1
nor	1
torn	1
off	1
her	1
pink	1
slippers	1
with	1
high	1
hollowed	1
out	1
heels	1
did	1
not	1
pinch	1
but	1
gladdened	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
thick	1
rolls	1
of	1
fair	1
chignon	1
kept	1
up	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
her	1
own	1
hair	1
all	1
the	1
three	1
buttons	1
buttoned	1
up	1
without	1
tearing	1
on	1
the	1
long	1
glove	1
that	1
covered	1
her	1
hand	1
without	1
concealing	1
its	1
lines	1
the	1
black	1
velvet	1
of	1
her	1
locket	1
nestled	1
with	1
special	1
softness	1
round	1
her	1
neck	1
that	1
velvet	1
was	1
delicious	1
at	1
home	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
neck	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
kitty	1
had	1
felt	1
that	1
that	1
velvet	1
was	1
speaking	1
about	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
doubt	1
but	1
the	1
velvet	1
was	1
delicious	1
kitty	1
smiled	1
here	1
too	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
when	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
her	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
and	1
arms	1
gave	1
kitty	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
chill	1
marble	1
a	1
feeling	1
she	1
particularly	1
liked	1
her	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
and	1
her	1
rosy	1
lips	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
from	1
smiling	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
attractiveness	1
she	1
had	1
scarcely	1
entered	1
the	1
ballroom	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
throng	1
of	1
ladies	1
all	1
tulle	1
ribbons	1
lace	1
and	1
flowers	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
dance	1
kitty	1
was	1
never	1
one	1
of	1
that	1
throng	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
waltz	1
and	1
asked	1
by	1
the	1
best	1
partner	1
the	1
first	1
star	1
in	1
the	1
hierarchy	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom	1
a	1
renowned	1
director	1
of	1
dances	1
a	1
married	1
man	1
handsome	1
and	1
well	1
built	1
yegorushka	1
korsunsky	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
left	1
the	1
countess	1
bonina	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
danced	1
the	1
first	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
waltz	1
and	1
scanning	1
his	1
kingdom	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
couples	1
who	1
had	1
started	1
dancing	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
kitty	1
entering	1
and	1
flew	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
that	1
peculiar	1
easy	1
amble	1
which	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
directors	1
of	1
balls	1
without	1
even	1
asking	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
cared	1
to	1
dance	1
he	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
encircle	1
her	1
slender	1
waist	1
she	1
looked	1
round	1
for	1
someone	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
fan	1
to	1
and	1
their	1
hostess	1
smiling	1
to	1
her	1
took	1
it	1
how	1
nice	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
embracing	1
her	1
waist	1
such	1
a	1
bad	1
habit	1
to	1
be	1
late	1
bending	1
her	1
left	1
hand	1
she	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
her	1
little	1
feet	1
in	1
their	1
pink	1
slippers	1
began	1
swiftly	1
lightly	1
and	1
rhythmically	1
moving	1
over	1
the	1
slippery	1
floor	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
music	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
rest	1
to	1
waltz	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
they	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
slow	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
waltz	1
it	1
s	1
exquisite	1
such	1
lightness	1
precision	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
almost	1
all	1
his	1
partners	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
well	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
his	1
praise	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
girl	1
at	1
her	1
first	1
ball	1
for	1
whom	1
all	1
faces	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
melt	1
into	1
one	1
vision	1
of	1
fairyland	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
the	1
stale	1
round	1
of	1
balls	1
till	1
every	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
was	1
familiar	1
and	1
tiresome	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
stage	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
she	1
was	1
excited	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
sufficient	1
self	1
possession	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
observe	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
cream	1
of	1
society	1
gathered	1
together	1
there	1
incredibly	1
naked	1
was	1
the	1
beauty	1
lidi	1
korsunsky	1

wife	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
there	1
shone	1
the	1
bald	1
head	1
of	1
krivin	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
where	1
the	1
best	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
gazed	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
not	1
venturing	1
to	1
approach	1
there	1
too	1
she	1
descried	1
stiva	1
and	1
there	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
exquisite	1
figure	1
and	1
head	1
of	1
anna	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
velvet	1
gown	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
kitty	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
the	1
evening	1
she	1
refused	1
levin	1
with	1
her	1
long	1
sighted	1
eyes	1
she	1
knew	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
was	1
even	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
another	1
turn	1
eh	1
you	1
re	1
not	1

me	1

wherever	1
you	1

and	1
korsunsky	1
began	1
waltzing	1
with	1
measured	1
steps	1
straight	1
towards	1
the	1
group	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
corner	1
continually	1
saying	1
pardon	1
mesdames	1
pardon	1
pardon	1

and	1
steering	1
his	1
course	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
lace	1
tulle	1
and	1
ribbon	1
and	1
not	1
disarranging	1
a	1
feather	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
partner	1
sharply	1
round	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
slim	1
ankles	1
in	1
light	1
transparent	1
stockings	1
were	1
exposed	1
to	1
view	1
and	1
her	1
train	1
floated	1
out	1
in	1

and	1
covered	1
krivin	1

knees	1
korsunsky	1
bowed	1
set	1
straight	1

gave	1
her	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1

flushed	1
took	1
her	1

from	1

a	1
little	1
giddy	1
looked	1
round	1

showing	1
her	1
full	1
throat	1
and	1
shoulders	1
that	1
looked	1
as	1
though	1
carved	1
in	1
old	1
ivory	1
and	1
her	1
rounded	1
arms	1
with	1
tiny	1
slender	1
wrists	1
the	1
whole	1
gown	1
was	1
trimmed	1
with	1
venetian	1
guipure	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
among	1
her	1
black	1
hair	1
her	1
own	1
with	1
no	1
false	1
additions	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
wreath	1
of	1
pansies	1
and	1
a	1
bouquet	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
ribbon	1
of	1
her	1
sash	1
among	1
white	1
lace	1
her	1
coiffure	1
was	1
not	1
striking	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
noticeable	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
wilful	1
tendrils	1
of	1
her	1
curly	1
hair	1
that	1
would	1
always	1
break	1
free	1
about	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
temples	1
round	1
her	1
well	1
cut	1
strong	1
neck	1
was	1
a	1
thread	1
of	1
pearls	1
kitty	1
had	1
been	1
seeing	1
anna	1
every	1
day	1
she	1
adored	1
her	1
and	1
had	1
pictured	1
her	1
invariably	1
in	1
lilac	1
but	1
now	1
seeing	1
her	1
in	1
black	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
fully	1
seen	1
her	1
charm	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
someone	1
quite	1
new	1
and	1
surprising	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
she	1
understood	1
that	1
anna	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
lilac	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
charm	1
was	1
just	1
that	1
she	1
always	1
stood	1
out	1
against	1
her	1
attire	1
that	1
her	1
dress	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
noticeable	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
black	1
dress	1
with	1
its	1
sumptuous	1
lace	1
was	1
not	1
noticeable	1
on	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
frame	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
seen	1
was	1
she	1
simple	1
natural	1
elegant	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
gay	1
and	1
eager	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
holding	1
herself	1
as	1
always	1
very	1
erect	1
and	1
when	1
kitty	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
group	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
her	1
head	1
slightly	1
turned	1
towards	1
him	1
no	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
throw	1
stones	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
something	1
though	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
shrugging	1
her	1
shoulders	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
smile	1
of	1
protection	1
towards	1
kitty	1
with	1
a	1
flying	1
feminine	1
glance	1
she	1
scanned	1
her	1
attire	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
hardly	1
perceptible	1
but	1
understood	1
by	1
kitty	1
signifying	1
approval	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
her	1
looks	1
you	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1

she	1
added	1

one	1
of	1
my	1
most	1

bending	1
down	1
to	1

why	1

up	1

since	1

us	1
start	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
noticing	1

and	1
she	1
hastily	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
korsunsky	1
s	1
shoulder	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
vexed	1
with	1
him	1
about	1

that	1
anna	1
had	1
intentionally	1
not	1
responded	1
to	1
vronsky	1
s	1
bow	1
vronsky	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
kitty	1
reminding	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
quadrille	1
and	1
expressing	1
his	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
kitty	1
gazed	1
in	1
admiration	1
at	1
anna	1
waltzing	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
expected	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
waltz	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
wonderingly	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
flushed	1
slightly	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
waltz	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
put	1
his	1
arm	1
round	1
her	1
waist	1
and	1
taken	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
when	1
the	1
music	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
kitty	1
looked	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
long	1
afterwards	1
for	1
several	1
years	1
after	1
that	1
look	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
no	1

to	1
the	1

the	1

vronsky	1
and	1
kitty	1
waltzed	1
several	1
times	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
waltz	1
kitty	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
hardly	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
countess	1
nordston	1
when	1
vronsky	1
came	1
up	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
quadrille	1
during	1
the	1
quadrille	1
nothing	1
of	1
any	1
significance	1
was	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
disjointed	1
talk	1
between	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
korsunskys	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
whom	1
he	1
described	1
very	1
amusingly	1
as	1
delightful	1
children	1
at	1
forty	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
town	1
theater	1
and	1
only	1
once	1
the	1
conversation	1
touched	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
about	1
levin	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
and	1
added	1
that	1
he	1
liked	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
but	1
kitty	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
much	1
from	1
the	1
quadrille	1
she	1
looked	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
thrill	1
at	1
her	1
heart	1
to	1
the	1
mazurka	1
she	1
fancied	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
mazurka	1
everything	1
must	1
be	1
decided	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
during	1
the	1
quadrille	1
ask	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
mazurka	1
did	1
not	1
trouble	1
her	1
she	1
felt	1
sure	1
she	1
would	1
dance	1
the	1
mazurka	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
former	1
balls	1
and	1
refused	1
five	1
young	1
men	1
saying	1
she	1
was	1
engaged	1
for	1
the	1
mazurka	1
the	1
whole	1
ball	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
quadrille	1
was	1
for	1
kitty	1
an	1
enchanted	1
vision	1
of	1
delightful	1
colors	1
sounds	1
and	1
motions	1
she	1
only	1
sat	1
down	1
when	1
she	1
felt	1
too	1
tired	1
and	1
begged	1
for	1
a	1
rest	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
the	1
last	1
quadrille	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tiresome	1
young	1
men	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
she	1
chanced	1
to	1
be	1
vis	1
à	1
vis	1
with	1
vronsky	1
and	1
anna	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
near	1
anna	1
again	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
now	1
again	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
suddenly	1
quite	1
new	1
and	1
surprising	1
she	1
saw	1
in	1
her	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
that	1
excitement	1
of	1
success	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
herself	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
intoxicated	1
with	1
the	1
delighted	1
admiration	1
she	1
was	1
exciting	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
feeling	1
and	1
knew	1
its	1
signs	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
anna	1
saw	1
the	1
quivering	1
flashing	1
light	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
excitement	1
unconsciously	1
playing	1
on	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
deliberate	1
grace	1
precision	1
and	1
lightness	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
who	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
all	1
or	1
one	1
and	1
not	1
assisting	1
the	1
harassed	1
young	1
man	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
pick	1
up	1
again	1
she	1
obeyed	1
with	1
external	1
liveliness	1
the	1
peremptory	1
shouts	1
of	1
korsunsky	1
starting	1
them	1
all	1
into	1
the	1
grand	1
rond	1
and	1
then	1
into	1
the	1
chaîne	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
kept	1
watch	1
with	1
a	1
growing	1
pang	1
at	1
her	1
heart	1
no	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
has	1
intoxicated	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
adoration	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
he	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
anna	1
the	1
joyous	1
light	1
flashed	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
curved	1
her	1
red	1
lips	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
control	1
herself	1
to	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
show	1
these	1
signs	1
of	1
delight	1
but	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
of	1
themselves	1
but	1
what	1
of	1
him	1
kitty	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
terror	1
what	1
was	1
pictured	1
so	1
clearly	1
to	1
kitty	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
face	1
she	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
his	1
always	1
self	1
possessed	1
resolute	1
manner	1
and	1
the	1
carelessly	1
serene	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
now	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
humble	1
submission	1
and	1
dread	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
offend	1
you	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
every	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
saying	1
but	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
save	1
myself	1
and	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
such	1
as	1
kitty	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
common	1
acquaintances	1
keeping	1
up	1
the	1
most	1
trivial	1
conversation	1
but	1
to	1
kitty	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
every	1
word	1
they	1
said	1
was	1
determining	1
their	1
fate	1
and	1
hers	1
and	1
strange	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
actually	1
talking	1
of	1
how	1
absurd	1
ivan	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
french	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
eletsky	1
girl	1
might	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
better	1
match	1
yet	1
these	1
words	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
consequence	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
feeling	1
just	1
as	1
kitty	1
did	1
the	1
whole	1
ball	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
everything	1
seemed	1
lost	1
in	1
fog	1
in	1
kitty	1
s	1
soul	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
stern	1
discipline	1
of	1
her	1
bringing	1
up	1
supported	1
her	1
and	1
forced	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
dance	1
to	1
answer	1
questions	1
to	1
talk	1
even	1
to	1
smile	1
but	1
before	1
the	1
mazurka	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
rearrange	1
the	1
chairs	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
couples	1
moved	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
smaller	1
rooms	1
into	1
the	1
big	1
room	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
horror	1
came	1
for	1
kitty	1
she	1
had	1
refused	1
five	1
partners	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
dancing	1
the	1
mazurka	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
being	1
asked	1
for	1
it	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
successful	1
in	1
society	1
that	1
the	1
idea	1
would	1
never	1
occur	1
to	1
anyone	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
remained	1
disengaged	1
till	1
now	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
mother	1
she	1
felt	1
ill	1
and	1
go	1
home	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
she	1
felt	1
crushed	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
furthest	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
low	1
chair	1
her	1
light	1
transparent	1
skirts	1
rose	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
about	1
her	1
slender	1
waist	1
one	1
bare	1
thin	1
soft	1
girlish	1
arm	1
hanging	1
listlessly	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
pink	1
tunic	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
held	1
her	1
fan	1
and	1
with	1
rapid	1
short	1
strokes	1
fanned	1
her	1
burning	1
face	1
but	1
while	1
she	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
butterfly	1
clinging	1
to	1
a	1
blade	1
of	1
grass	1
and	1
just	1
about	1
to	1
open	1
its	1
rainbow	1
wings	1
for	1
fresh	1
flight	1
her	1
heart	1
ached	1
with	1
a	1
horrible	1
despair	1
but	1
perhaps	1
i	1
am	1
wrong	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
recalled	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
kitty	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
said	1
countess	1
nordston	1
stepping	1
noiselessly	1
over	1
the	1
carpet	1
towards	1
her	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
kitty	1
s	1
lower	1
lip	1
began	1
to	1
quiver	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
quickly	1
kitty	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
dancing	1
the	1
mazurka	1
no	1
no	1
said	1
kitty	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
shaking	1
with	1
tears	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
mazurka	1
before	1
me	1
said	1
countess	1
nordston	1
knowing	1
kitty	1
would	1
understand	1
who	1
were	1
he	1
and	1
her	1
she	1
said	1
why	1
aren	1
t	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
dance	1
it	1
with	1
princess	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
oh	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
answered	1
kitty	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
she	1
herself	1
understood	1
her	1
position	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
refused	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
perhaps	1
she	1
loved	1
and	1
refused	1
him	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
faith	1
in	1
another	1
countess	1
nordston	1
found	1
korsunsky	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
dance	1
the	1
mazurka	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
kitty	1
kitty	1
danced	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
couple	1
and	1
luckily	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
talk	1
because	1
korsunsky	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
running	1
about	1
directing	1
the	1
figure	1
vronsky	1
and	1
anna	1
sat	1
almost	1
opposite	1
her	1
she	1
saw	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
long	1
sighted	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
too	1
close	1
by	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
figures	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
she	1
saw	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
more	1
convinced	1
was	1
she	1
that	1
her	1
unhappiness	1
was	1
complete	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
felt	1
themselves	1
alone	1
in	1
that	1
crowded	1
room	1
and	1
on	1
vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
always	1
so	1
firm	1
and	1
independent	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
look	1
that	1
had	1
struck	1
her	1
of	1
bewilderment	1
and	1
humble	1
submissiveness	1
like	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
an	1
intelligent	1
dog	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
done	1
wrong	1
anna	1
smiled	1
and	1
her	1
smile	1
was	1
reflected	1
by	1
him	1
she	1
grew	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
serious	1
some	1
supernatural	1
force	1
drew	1
kitty	1
s	1
eyes	1
to	1
anna	1
s	1
face	1
she	1
was	1
fascinating	1
in	1
her	1
simple	1
black	1
dress	1
fascinating	1
were	1
her	1
round	1
arms	1
with	1
their	1
bracelets	1
fascinating	1
was	1
her	1
firm	1
neck	1
with	1
its	1
thread	1
of	1
pearls	1
fascinating	1
the	1
straying	1
curls	1
of	1
her	1
loose	1
hair	1
fascinating	1
the	1
graceful	1
light	1
movements	1
of	1
her	1
little	1
feet	1
and	1
hands	1
fascinating	1
was	1
that	1
lovely	1
face	1
in	1
its	1
eagerness	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
cruel	1
in	1
her	1
fascination	1
kitty	1
admired	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
acute	1
was	1
her	1
suffering	1
kitty	1
felt	1
overwhelmed	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
showed	1
it	1
when	1
vronsky	1
saw	1
her	1
coming	1
across	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
mazurka	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
recognize	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
changed	1
delightful	1
ball	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
saying	1
something	1
yes	1
she	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
mazurka	1
repeating	1
a	1
complicated	1
figure	1
newly	1
invented	1
by	1
korsunsky	1
anna	1
came	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
chose	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
summoned	1
a	1
lady	1
and	1
kitty	1
kitty	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
dismay	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
anna	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
drooping	1
eyelids	1
and	1
smiled	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
but	1
noticing	1
that	1
kitty	1
only	1
responded	1
to	1
her	1
smile	1
by	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
amazement	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
began	1
gaily	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
lady	1
yes	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
uncanny	1
devilish	1
and	1
fascinating	1
in	1
her	1
kitty	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
stay	1
to	1
supper	1
but	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
began	1
to	1
press	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
nonsense	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
said	1
korsunsky	1
drawing	1
her	1
bare	1
arm	1
under	1
the	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
dress	1
coat	1
i	1
ve	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
for	1
a	1
cotillion	1
un	1
bijou	1
	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
gradually	1
on	1
trying	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
along	1
with	1
him	1
their	1
host	1
smiled	1
approvingly	1
no	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
stay	1
answered	1
anna	1
smiling	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
smile	1
both	1
korsunsky	1
and	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
saw	1
from	1
her	1
resolute	1
tone	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
stay	1
no	1
why	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
have	1
danced	1
more	1
at	1
your	1
ball	1
in	1
moscow	1
than	1
i	1
have	1
all	1
the	1

in	1

said	1
anna	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
vronsky	1
who	1
stood	1
near	1
her	1
i	1
must	1
rest	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
my	1
journey	1

you	1
certainly	1
going	1
tomorrow	1
then	1
asked	1
vronsky	1
yes	1
i	1
suppose	1
so	1
answered	1
anna	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
his	1
question	1
but	1
the	1
irrepressible	1
quivering	1
brilliance	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
smile	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
fire	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
to	1
supper	1
but	1
went	1

chapter	1
24	1
yes	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
me	1
hateful	1
repulsive	1
thought	1
levin	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
lodgings	1
and	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
other	1
people	1
pride	1
they	1
say	1
no	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
pride	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
any	1
pride	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
put	1
myself	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
and	1
he	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
vronsky	1
happy	1
good	1
natured	1
clever	1
and	1
self	1
possessed	1
certainly	1
never	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
awful	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
that	1
evening	1
yes	1
she	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
choose	1
him	1
so	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
i	1
cannot	1
complain	1
of	1
anyone	1
or	1
anything	1
i	1
am	1
myself	1
to	1
blame	1
what	1
right	1
had	1
i	1
to	1
imagine	1
she	1
would	1
care	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
life	1
to	1
mine	1
who	1
am	1
i	1
and	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
a	1
nobody	1
not	1
wanted	1
by	1
anyone	1
nor	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
anybody	1
and	1
he	1
recalled	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
and	1
dwelt	1
with	1
pleasure	1
on	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
isn	1
t	1
he	1
right	1
that	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
base	1
and	1
loathsome	1
and	1
are	1
we	1
fair	1
in	1
our	1
judgment	1
of	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
of	1
course	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
prokofy	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
torn	1
cloak	1
and	1
tipsy	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
despicable	1
person	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
him	1
differently	1
i	1
know	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
like	1
him	1
and	1
i	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
seek	1
him	1
out	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
came	1
here	1
levin	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
lamppost	1
read	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
address	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
pocketbook	1
and	1
called	1
a	1
sledge	1
all	1
the	1
long	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
levin	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
familiar	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
s	1
life	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
his	1
brother	1
while	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
afterwards	1
had	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
jeers	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
lived	1
like	1
a	1
monk	1
strictly	1
observing	1
all	1
religious	1
rites	1
services	1
and	1
fasts	1
and	1
avoiding	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
pleasure	1
especially	1
women	1
and	1
afterwards	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
broken	1
out	1
he	1
had	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
people	1
and	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
most	1
senseless	1
debauchery	1
he	1
remembered	1
later	1
the	1
scandal	1
over	1
a	1
boy	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
rage	1
had	1
so	1
violently	1
beaten	1
that	1
proceedings	1
were	1
brought	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
unlawfully	1
wounding	1
then	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
scandal	1
with	1
a	1
sharper	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
money	1
and	1
given	1
a	1
promissory	1
note	1
and	1
against	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
lodged	1
a	1
complaint	1
asserting	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
cheated	1
him	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
money	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
had	1
paid	1
then	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
a	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
lockup	1
for	1
disorderly	1
conduct	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
shameful	1
proceedings	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
against	1
his	1
brother	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
accusing	1
him	1
of	1
not	1
having	1
paid	1
him	1
his	1
share	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
fortune	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
scandal	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
western	1
province	1
in	1
an	1
official	1
capacity	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
trouble	1
for	1
assaulting	1
a	1
village	1
elder	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
horribly	1
disgusting	1
yet	1
to	1
levin	1
it	1
appeared	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
disgusting	1
light	1
as	1
it	1
inevitably	1
would	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
nikolay	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
all	1
his	1
story	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
his	1
heart	1
levin	1
remembered	1
that	1
when	1
nikolay	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
devout	1
stage	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
fasts	1
and	1
monks	1
and	1
church	1
services	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
seeking	1
in	1
religion	1
a	1
support	1
and	1
a	1
curb	1
for	1
his	1
passionate	1
temperament	1
everyone	1
far	1
from	1
encouraging	1
him	1
had	1
jeered	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
with	1
the	1
others	1
they	1
had	1
teased	1
him	1
called	1
him	1
noah	1
and	1
monk	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
out	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
helped	1
him	1
but	1
everyone	1
had	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
disgust	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
ugliness	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
than	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
despised	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
born	1
with	1
his	1
unbridled	1
temperament	1
and	1
his	1
somehow	1
limited	1
intelligence	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
him	1
everything	1
without	1
reserve	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
speak	1
without	1
reserve	1
too	1
and	1
i	1
ll	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
understand	1
him	1
levin	1
resolved	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
towards	1
eleven	1
o	1

he	1
reached	1
the	1
hotel	1
of	1
which	1

the	1

half	1

there	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streak	1
of	1
light	1
thick	1
fumes	1
of	1
cheap	1
poor	1
tobacco	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
voice	1
unknown	1
to	1
levin	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
there	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
cough	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
unknown	1
voice	1
was	1
saying	1

looked	1
in	1
at	1

that	1

a	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
an	1
immense	1
shock	1
of	1

konstantin	1
felt	1
a	1
sharp	1
pang	1
at	1
his	1
heart	1
at	1
the	1

the	1
strange	1
company	1
in	1
which	1
his	1

spent	1
his	1

there	1
s	1
some	1
gentleman	1
nikolay	1
dmitrievitch	1
she	1
said	1
whom	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
said	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
angrily	1
it	1
s	1
i	1
answered	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
coming	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
who	1
s	1
i	1
nikolay	1
s	1
voice	1
said	1
again	1
still	1
more	1
angrily	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
getting	1
up	1
hurriedly	1
stumbling	1
against	1
something	1
and	1
levin	1
saw	1
facing	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
the	1
big	1
scared	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
huge	1
thin	1
stooping	1
figure	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
so	1
familiar	1
and	1
yet	1
astonishing	1
in	1
its	1
weirdness	1
and	1
sickliness	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
thinner	1
than	1
three	1
years	1
before	1
when	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
last	1
he	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
short	1
coat	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
big	1
bones	1
seemed	1
huger	1
than	1
ever	1
his	1
hair	1
had	1
grown	1
thinner	1
the	1
same	1
straight	1
mustaches	1
hid	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
same	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
strangely	1
and	1
naïvely	1
at	1
his	1
visitor	1
ah	1
kostya	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
suddenly	1
recognizing	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
joy	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
second	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
nervous	1
jerk	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
neck	1
that	1
konstantin	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
neckband	1
hurt	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
expression	1
wild	1
suffering	1
and	1
cruel	1
rested	1
on	1
his	1
emaciated	1
face	1
i	1
wrote	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
both	1
that	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
konstantin	1
had	1
been	1
fancying	1
him	1
the	1
worst	1
and	1
most	1
tiresome	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
what	1
made	1
all	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
so	1
difficult	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
by	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
especially	1
that	1
nervous	1
twitching	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
remembered	1
it	1
all	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
for	1
anything	1
he	1
answered	1
timidly	1
i	1
ve	1
simply	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
timidity	1
obviously	1
softened	1
nikolay	1
his	1
lips	1
twitched	1
oh	1
so	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
well	1
come	1
in	1
sit	1
down	1
like	1
some	1
supper	1
masha	1
bring	1
supper	1
for	1
three	1
no	1
stop	1
a	1
minute	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
this	1
is	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
indicating	1
the	1
gentleman	1
in	1
the	1
jerkin	1
this	1
is	1
mr	1
kritsky	1
my	1
friend	1
from	1
kiev	1
a	1
very	1
remarkable	1
man	1
he	1
s	1
persecuted	1
by	1
the	1
police	1
of	1
course	1
because	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
scoundrel	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
at	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
was	1
moving	1
to	1
go	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
her	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
i	1
said	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
inability	1
to	1
express	1
himself	1
the	1
incoherence	1
that	1
konstantin	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
he	1
began	1
with	1
another	1
look	1
round	1
at	1
everyone	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
brother	1
kritsky	1
s	1
story	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
expelled	1
from	1
the	1
university	1
for	1
starting	1
a	1
benefit	1
society	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
students	1
and	1
sunday	1
schools	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
afterwards	1
been	1
a	1
teacher	1
in	1
a	1
peasant	1
school	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
too	1
and	1
had	1
afterwards	1
been	1
condemned	1
for	1
something	1
you	1
re	1
of	1
the	1
kiev	1
university	1
said	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
to	1
kritsky	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
awkward	1
silence	1
that	1
followed	1
yes	1
i	1
was	1
of	1
kiev	1
kritsky	1
replied	1
angrily	1
his	1
face	1
darkening	1
and	1
this	1
woman	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
interrupted	1
him	1
pointing	1
to	1
her	1
is	1
the	1
partner	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
i	1
took	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
house	1
and	1
he	1
jerked	1
his	1
neck	1
saying	1
this	1
but	1
i	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
respect	1
her	1
and	1
anyone	1
who	1
wants	1
to	1
know	1
me	1
he	1
added	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
knitting	1
his	1
brows	1
i	1
beg	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
respect	1
her	1
she	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
my	1
wife	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
so	1
now	1
you	1
know	1
whom	1
you	1
ve	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
re	1
lowering	1
yourself	1
well	1
here	1
s	1
the	1
floor	1
there	1
s	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
again	1
his	1
eyes	1
traveled	1
inquiringly	1
over	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
why	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
lowering	1
myself	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
then	1
masha	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
supper	1
three	1
portions	1
spirits	1
and	1
wine	1
no	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
no	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
matter	1
go	1
along	1
chapter	1
25	1
so	1
you	1
see	1
pursued	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
painfully	1
wrinkling	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
twitching	1
it	1
was	1
obviously	1
difficult	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
do	1
here	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
iron	1
bars	1
fastened	1
together	1
with	1
strings	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
thing	1
we	1
re	1
going	1
into	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
productive	1
association	1
konstantin	1
scarcely	1
heard	1
him	1
he	1
looked	1
into	1
his	1
sickly	1
consumptive	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
force	1
himself	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
telling	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
association	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
association	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
anchor	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
self	1
contempt	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
capital	1
oppresses	1
the	1
laborer	1
the	1
laborers	1
with	1
us	1
the	1
peasants	1
bear	1
all	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
labor	1
and	1
are	1
so	1
placed	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
they	1
work	1
they	1
can	1
t	1
escape	1
from	1
their	1
position	1
of	1
beasts	1
of	1
burden	1
all	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
labor	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
improve	1
their	1
position	1
and	1
gain	1
leisure	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
education	1
all	1
the	1
surplus	1
values	1
are	1
taken	1
from	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
capitalists	1
and	1
society	1
s	1
so	1
constituted	1
that	1
the	1
harder	1
they	1
work	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
profit	1
of	1
the	1
merchants	1
and	1
landowners	1
while	1
they	1
stay	1
beasts	1
of	1
burden	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
changed	1
he	1
finished	1
up	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
yes	1
of	1
course	1
said	1
konstantin	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
patch	1
of	1
red	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
projecting	1
cheekbones	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
re	1
founding	1
a	1
locksmiths	1
association	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
production	1
and	1
profit	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
instruments	1
of	1
production	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
common	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
association	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
vozdrem	1
kazan	1
government	1
but	1
why	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
in	1
the	1
villages	1
i	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
work	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
why	1
a	1
locksmiths	1
association	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
why	1
because	1
the	1
peasants	1
are	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
slaves	1
as	1
they	1
ever	1
were	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
you	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
people	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
get	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
slavery	1
said	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
exasperated	1
by	1
the	1
objection	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
sighed	1
looking	1
meanwhile	1
about	1
the	1
cheerless	1
and	1
dirty	1
room	1
this	1
sigh	1
seemed	1
to	1
exasperate	1
nikolay	1
still	1
more	1
i	1
know	1
your	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
aristocratic	1
views	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
applies	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
intellect	1
to	1
justify	1
existing	1
evils	1
no	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
talk	1
of	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
for	1
said	1
levin	1
smiling	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
for	1
nikolay	1

shrieked	1
suddenly	1
at	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
for	1
but	1
what	1

the	1
use	1
of	1
talking	1
there	1
s	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
you	1
look	1
down	1
on	1

shrieked	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
i	1
don	1
t	1

at	1
all	1
said	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
timidly	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
even	1
dispute	1
it	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
came	1
back	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
looked	1
round	1
angrily	1
at	1
her	1

went	1
quickly	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
whispered	1
something	1

ve	1
grown	1
irritable	1
said	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
getting	1
calmer	1

breathing	1
painfully	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
his	1
article	1

rubbish	1

exasperation	1
upon	1

out	1
a	1

timidly	1
into	1
his	1

that	1
nikolay	1
shouted	1
joyfully	1
but	1
i	1
personally	1
value	1
friendly	1
relations	1
with	1
you	1
more	1
because	1
why	1
why	1
konstantin	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
valued	1
it	1
more	1
because	1
nikolay	1
was	1
unhappy	1
and	1
needed	1
affection	1
but	1
nikolay	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
scowling	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1

smiled	1
a	1
sweet	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
smile	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
reflected	1
on	1
nikolay	1

face	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
bottle	1
and	1
do	1
you	1

she	1
understands	1
nothing	1

only	1
you	1

with	1

her	1
no	1

spoke	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
but	1
the	1
justices	1
of	1

for	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
ill	1
fame	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
the	1
senselessness	1
in	1

cried	1
suddenly	1
these	1
new	1
institutions	1
these	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
rural	1
councils	1
what	1
hideousness	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
enlarge	1
on	1
his	1
encounters	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
institutions	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
heard	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
disbelief	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
all	1
public	1
institutions	1
which	1
he	1
shared	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
often	1
expressed	1

distasteful	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
from	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
lips	1
in	1
another	1
world	1
we	1
shall	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
lightly	1
in	1
another	1

ah	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
that	1
other	1
world	1
i	1
don	1

he	1
said	1
letting	1
his	1
scared	1
eyes	1
rest	1
on	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
eyes	1
here	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
baseness	1
and	1
the	1
mess	1
one	1
s	1
own	1
and	1
other	1

would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
and	1
yet	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
of	1
death	1
awfully	1
afraid	1
of	1
death	1
he	1
shuddered	1
but	1
do	1

something	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
some	1
champagne	1
or	1
shall	1

his	1
speech	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
falter	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
abruptly	1
from	1
one	1
subject	1
to	1
another	1
konstantin	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
masha	1
persuaded	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
anywhere	1
and	1
got	1
him	1
to	1
bed	1
hopelessly	1
drunk	1

promised	1
to	1
write	1
to	1

in	1
case	1
of	1

chapter	1
26	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
left	1
moscow	1
and	1
towards	1
evening	1
he	1
reached	1
home	1
on	1
the	1
journey	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
his	1
neighbors	1
about	1
politics	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
railways	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
in	1
moscow	1
he	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
confusion	1
of	1
ideas	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
himself	1
shame	1
of	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
station	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
one	1
eyed	1
coachman	1
ignat	1
with	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
turned	1
up	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
reflected	1
by	1
the	1
station	1
fires	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
own	1
sledge	1
his	1
own	1
horses	1
with	1
their	1
tails	1
tied	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
harness	1
trimmed	1
with	1
rings	1
and	1
tassels	1
when	1
the	1
coachman	1
ignat	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
luggage	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
village	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
contractor	1
had	1
arrived	1
and	1
that	1
pava	1
had	1
calved	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
the	1
confusion	1
was	1
clearing	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
self	1
dissatisfaction	1
were	1
passing	1
away	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
ignat	1
and	1
the	1
horses	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
sheepskin	1
brought	1
for	1
him	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sledge	1
and	1
had	1
driven	1
off	1
pondering	1
on	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
horse	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
saddle	1
horse	1
past	1
his	1
prime	1
now	1
but	1
a	1
spirited	1
beast	1
from	1
the	1
don	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
light	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
anyone	1
else	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
now	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
resolved	1
that	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
up	1
hoping	1
for	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
happiness	1
such	1
as	1
marriage	1
must	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
and	1
consequently	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
so	1
disdain	1
what	1
he	1
really	1
had	1
secondly	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
again	1
let	1
himself	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
low	1
passion	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
tortured	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
making	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
then	1
remembering	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
forget	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
follow	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
not	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
when	1
things	1
should	1
go	1
ill	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
soon	1
he	1
felt	1
then	1
too	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
talk	1
of	1
communism	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
treated	1
so	1
lightly	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
now	1
made	1
him	1
think	1
he	1
considered	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
economic	1
conditions	1
nonsense	1
but	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
abundance	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
poverty	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
determined	1
that	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
feel	1
quite	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
worked	1
hard	1
and	1
lived	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
luxuriously	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
now	1
work	1
still	1
harder	1
and	1
would	1
allow	1
himself	1
even	1
less	1
luxury	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
easy	1
a	1
conquest	1
over	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
drive	1
in	1
the	1
pleasantest	1
daydreams	1
with	1
a	1
resolute	1
feeling	1
of	1
hope	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
better	1
life	1
he	1
reached	1
home	1
before	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
at	1
night	1
the	1
snow	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
quadrangle	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom	1
windows	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
nurse	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
who	1
performed	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
housekeeper	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
asleep	1

up	1

her	1
came	1
sidling	1
sleepily	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
a	1
setter	1
bitch	1
laska	1
ran	1
out	1
too	1
almost	1
upsetting	1
kouzma	1
and	1
whining	1
turned	1
round	1
about	1
levin	1
s	1
knees	1
jumping	1
up	1
and	1
longing	1
but	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
forepaws	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
you	1
re	1
soon	1
back	1
again	1

said	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
i	1
got	1
tired	1
of	1

mihalovna	1
with	1
friends	1
one	1
is	1
well	1
but	1
at	1
home	1
one	1
is	1
better	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
the	1
study	1
was	1
slowly	1
lit	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
candle	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1

came	1
out	1

looking	1
glass	1

with	1
its	1

had	1

wanted	1

a	1
large	1

on	1
the	1

an	1
open	1
book	1
a	1
broken	1

a	1
manuscript	1
book	1
with	1
his	1
handwriting	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
this	1
there	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
arranging	1
the	1
new	1
life	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
dreaming	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
all	1
these	1
traces	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
seemed	1
to	1
clutch	1
him	1
and	1

said	1
to	1

but	1
another	1
voice	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
fall	1
under	1
the	1
sway	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
with	1
oneself	1
and	1
hearing	1
that	1
voice	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
corner	1
where	1
stood	1
his	1
two	1
heavy	1
dumbbells	1
and	1
began	1
brandishing	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
gymnast	1
trying	1
to	1
restore	1
his	1
confident	1
temper	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
creak	1
of	1
steps	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
hastily	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
dumbbells	1
the	1
bailiff	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
said	1
everything	1
thank	1
god	1
was	1
doing	1
well	1
but	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
buckwheat	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
drying	1
machine	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
scorched	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
irritated	1
levin	1
the	1
new	1
drying	1
machine	1
had	1
been	1
constructed	1
and	1
partly	1
invented	1
by	1
levin	1
the	1
bailiff	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
against	1
the	1
drying	1
machine	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
suppressed	1
triumph	1
that	1
he	1
announced	1
that	1
the	1
buckwheat	1
had	1
been	1
scorched	1
levin	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
buckwheat	1
had	1
been	1
scorched	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
precautions	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times	1
given	1
orders	1
he	1
was	1
annoyed	1
and	1
reprimanded	1
the	1
bailiff	1
but	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
important	1
and	1
joyful	1
event	1

at	1

the	1
more	1
valuable	1

just	1
behind	1
the	1
house	1
walking	1
across	1
the	1
yard	1
passing	1
a	1
snowdrift	1
by	1
the	1
lilac	1
tree	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
cowhouse	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
warm	1
steamy	1
smell	1
of	1
dung	1
when	1
the	1
frozen	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
cows	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
unfamiliar	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
lantern	1
stirred	1
on	1
the	1
fresh	1
straw	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
broad	1
smooth	1
black	1
and	1
piebald	1
back	1
of	1
hollandka	1

the	1

was	1
lying	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
ring	1
in	1
his	1
lip	1
and	1
seemed	1
about	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
but	1
thought	1
better	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
only	1
gave	1
two	1
snorts	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
by	1
him	1

a	1
perfect	1

sniffed	1
her	1
all	1
over	1

went	1
into	1

looked	1

over	1

lifted	1
the	1

spotted	1

onto	1
her	1
long	1
tottering	1
legs	1
pava	1
uneasy	1
began	1
lowing	1

when	1
levin	1
put	1
the	1
calf	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
soothed	1
and	1
sighing	1
heavily	1
began	1
licking	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
rough	1

the	1

fumbling	1
poked	1
her	1

the	1

for	1

under	1
the	1

about	1

this	1
question	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
take	1

back	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
estate	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale	1
and	1
complicated	1
he	1
went	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1

to	1
the	1

house	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1

the	1

chapter	1
27	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
big	1
and	1
old	1
fashioned	1
and	1
levin	1
though	1
he	1
lived	1
alone	1
had	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
heated	1
and	1
used	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
stupid	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
positively	1
not	1
right	1
and	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
present	1
new	1
plans	1
but	1
this	1
house	1
was	1
a	1
whole	1
world	1
to	1
levin	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
had	1
lived	1
and	1
died	1
they	1
had	1
lived	1
just	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
to	1
levin	1
seemed	1
the	1
ideal	1
of	1
perfection	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
dreamed	1
of	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
his	1
family	1
levin	1
scarcely	1
remembered	1
his	1
mother	1
his	1
conception	1
of	1
her	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
sacred	1
memory	1
and	1
his	1
future	1
wife	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
a	1
repetition	1
of	1
that	1
exquisite	1
holy	1
ideal	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
had	1
been	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
conceiving	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
woman	1
apart	1
from	1
marriage	1
that	1
he	1
positively	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
first	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
only	1
secondarily	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
family	1
his	1
ideas	1
of	1
marriage	1
were	1
consequently	1
quite	1
unlike	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
for	1
whom	1
getting	1
married	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
numerous	1
facts	1
of	1
social	1
life	1
for	1
levin	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
affair	1
of	1
life	1
on	1
which	1
its	1
whole	1
happiness	1
turned	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
tea	1
and	1
had	1
settled	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
with	1
a	1
book	1

a	1
while	1
sir	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
chair	1
in	1
the	1

he	1
felt	1
that	1
however	1
strange	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
parted	1
from	1
his	1
daydreams	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
without	1
them	1
whether	1
with	1
her	1
or	1
with	1
another	1
still	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
and	1
stopping	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
who	1
gossiped	1
away	1
without	1
flagging	1
and	1
yet	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
pictures	1
of	1
family	1
life	1
and	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
rose	1
disconnectedly	1
before	1
his	1
imagination	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
something	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
in	1
its	1
place	1
settled	1
down	1
and	1
laid	1
to	1
rest	1
he	1
heard	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
talking	1
of	1
how	1
prohor	1
had	1
forgotten	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1

with	1
the	1
money	1

him	1

had	1
beaten	1
his	1

he	1
d	1
half	1
killed	1
her	1
he	1
listened	1
and	1
read	1
his	1

recalled	1

by	1

reading	1

of	1
his	1
complacent	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
cleverness	1
of	1
his	1
experiments	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
philosophic	1
insight	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
floated	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
joyful	1
thought	1

electricity	1

a	1
tone	1
that	1
suggested	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
remember	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1

be	1
today	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
not	1
dining	1
at	1
home	1
but	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
his	1
sister	1
off	1
at	1
seven	1
o	1
clock	1
kitty	1
too	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
sending	1
a	1
note	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
headache	1
dolly	1
and	1
anna	1
dined	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
fickle	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
acute	1
senses	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
anna	1
was	1
quite	1
different	1
that	1
day	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
such	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
now	1
interested	1
in	1
them	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
abruptly	1
dropped	1
their	1
play	1
with	1
their	1
aunt	1
and	1
their	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
quite	1
indifferent	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
anna	1
was	1
absorbed	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
in	1
preparations	1
for	1
her	1
departure	1
she	1
wrote	1
notes	1
to	1
her	1
moscow	1
acquaintances	1
put	1
down	1
her	1
accounts	1
and	1
packed	1
altogether	1
dolly	1
fancied	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
placid	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
worried	1
mood	1
which	1
dolly	1
knew	1
well	1
with	1
herself	1
and	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
without	1
cause	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
covers	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
self	1
after	1
dinner	1
anna	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
dolly	1
followed	1
her	1
how	1
queer	1
you	1
are	1
today	1
dolly	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
i	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
queer	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
nasty	1
i	1
am	1
like	1
that	1
sometimes	1
i	1
keep	1
feeling	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
cry	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
stupid	1
but	1
it	1
ll	1
pass	1
off	1
said	1
anna	1
quickly	1
and	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
flushed	1
face	1
over	1
a	1
tiny	1
bag	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
packing	1
a	1
nightcap	1
and	1
some	1
cambric	1
handkerchiefs	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
particularly	1
bright	1
and	1
were	1
continually	1
swimming	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1

at	1

with	1
eyes	1
wet	1
with	1

that	1
dolly	1
i	1

nothing	1

what	1

clear	1
in	1
you	1

said	1
anna	1
suddenly	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
after	1
her	1
tears	1
a	1
sly	1
ironical	1
smile	1
curved	1
her	1
lips	1
come	1
he	1
s	1
amusing	1
anyway	1
your	1
skeleton	1
and	1

no	1

s	1
depressing	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
i	1
m	1
going	1
today	1
instead	1
of	1
tomorrow	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
confession	1
that	1
weighs	1
on	1
me	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
anna	1
letting	1
herself	1
drop	1
definitely	1
into	1
an	1
armchair	1
and	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
dolly	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
surprise	1
dolly	1
saw	1
that	1
anna	1
was	1
blushing	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
ears	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
curly	1
black	1
ringlets	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
yes	1
anna	1
went	1
on	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
kitty	1
didn	1
t	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
she	1
s	1
jealous	1
of	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
spoiled	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
that	1
ball	1
being	1
a	1
torture	1
to	1
her	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
pleasure	1
but	1
truly	1
truly	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
or	1
only	1
my	1
fault	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
she	1
said	1
daintily	1
drawling	1
the	1
words	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
oh	1
how	1
like	1
stiva	1
you	1
said	1
that	1
said	1
dolly	1
laughing	1
anna	1
was	1
hurt	1
oh	1
no	1
oh	1
no	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
stiva	1
she	1
said	1
knitting	1
her	1
brows	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
i	1
m	1
telling	1
you	1
just	1
because	1
i	1
could	1
never	1
let	1
myself	1
doubt	1
myself	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
said	1
anna	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
uttering	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
true	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
doubting	1
herself	1
she	1
felt	1
emotion	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
vronsky	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
sooner	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
simply	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
him	1
yes	1
stiva	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
danced	1
the	1
mazurka	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
how	1
absurdly	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
about	1
i	1
only	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
matchmaking	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
quite	1
differently	1
possibly	1
against	1
my	1
own	1
will	1
she	1
crimsoned	1
and	1
stopped	1
oh	1
they	1
feel	1
it	1
directly	1
said	1
dolly	1
but	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
despair	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
anything	1
serious	1
in	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
anna	1
interrupted	1
her	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
certain	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
forgotten	1
and	1
kitty	1
will	1
leave	1
off	1
hating	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
anna	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
very	1
anxious	1
for	1
this	1
marriage	1
for	1
kitty	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
better	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
nothing	1
if	1
he	1
vronsky	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
day	1
oh	1
heavens	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
silly	1
said	1
anna	1
and	1
again	1
a	1
deep	1
flush	1
of	1
pleasure	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
absorbed	1
her	1
put	1
into	1
words	1
and	1
so	1
here	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
having	1
made	1
an	1
enemy	1
of	1
kitty	1
whom	1
i	1
liked	1
so	1
much	1
ah	1
how	1
sweet	1
she	1
is	1
but	1
you	1
ll	1
make	1
it	1
right	1
dolly	1
eh	1
dolly	1
could	1
scarcely	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
she	1
loved	1
anna	1
but	1
she	1
enjoyed	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
her	1
weaknesses	1
an	1
enemy	1
that	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
want	1
you	1
all	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
care	1
for	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
said	1
anna	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
ah	1
how	1
silly	1
i	1
am	1
today	1
she	1
passed	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
began	1
dressing	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
of	1
starting	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
arrived	1
late	1
rosy	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
smelling	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
cigars	1
anna	1
s	1
emotionalism	1
infected	1
dolly	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
embraced	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
she	1
whispered	1
remember	1
anna	1
what	1
you	1
ve	1
done	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
and	1
remember	1
that	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
shall	1
always	1
love	1
you	1
as	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
why	1
said	1
anna	1
kissing	1
her	1
and	1
hiding	1
her	1
tears	1
you	1
understood	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
understand	1
good	1
bye	1
my	1
darling	1
chapter	1
29	1
come	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
thank	1
god	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
thought	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
stood	1
blocking	1
up	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
till	1
the	1
third	1
bell	1
rang	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
lounge	1
beside	1
annushka	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
of	1
the	1
sleeping	1
carriage	1
thank	1
god	1
tomorrow	1
i	1
shall	1
see	1
seryozha	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
my	1
life	1
will	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
all	1
nice	1
and	1
as	1
usual	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
anxious	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
anna	1
took	1
pleasure	1
in	1
arranging	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
with	1
great	1
care	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
deft	1
hands	1
she	1
opened	1
and	1
shut	1
her	1
little	1
red	1
bag	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
cushion	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
carefully	1
wrapping	1
up	1
her	1
feet	1
settled	1
herself	1
comfortably	1
an	1
invalid	1
lady	1
had	1
already	1
lain	1
down	1
to	1
sleep	1
two	1
other	1
ladies	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
anna	1
and	1
a	1
stout	1
elderly	1
lady	1
tucked	1
up	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
made	1
observations	1
about	1
the	1
heating	1
of	1
the	1
train	1
anna	1
answered	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
but	1
not	1
foreseeing	1
any	1
entertainment	1
from	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
asked	1
annushka	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
lamp	1
hooked	1
it	1
onto	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
her	1
seat	1
and	1
took	1
from	1
her	1
bag	1
a	1
paper	1
knife	1
and	1
an	1
english	1
novel	1
at	1
first	1
her	1
reading	1
made	1
no	1
progress	1
the	1
fuss	1
and	1
bustle	1
were	1
disturbing	1
then	1
when	1
the	1
train	1
had	1
started	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
noises	1
then	1
the	1
snow	1
beating	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
window	1
and	1
sticking	1
to	1
the	1
pane	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
muffled	1
guard	1
passing	1
by	1
covered	1
with	1
snow	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
conversations	1
about	1
the	1
terrible	1
snowstorm	1
raging	1
outside	1
distracted	1
her	1
attention	1
farther	1
on	1
it	1
was	1
continually	1
the	1
same	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
same	1
shaking	1
and	1
rattling	1
the	1
same	1
snow	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
the	1
same	1
rapid	1
transitions	1
from	1
steaming	1
heat	1
to	1
cold	1
and	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
heat	1
the	1
same	1
passing	1
glimpses	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
figures	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
voices	1
and	1
anna	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
she	1
read	1
annushka	1
was	1
already	1
dozing	1
the	1
red	1
bag	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
clutched	1
by	1
her	1
broad	1
hands	1
in	1
gloves	1
of	1
which	1
one	1
was	1
torn	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
read	1
and	1
understood	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
distasteful	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
read	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
reflection	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
lives	1
she	1
had	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
live	1
herself	1
if	1
she	1
read	1
that	1
the	1
heroine	1
of	1
the	1
novel	1
was	1
nursing	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
move	1
with	1
noiseless	1
steps	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
if	1
she	1
read	1
of	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
parliament	1
making	1
a	1
speech	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
be	1
delivering	1
the	1
speech	1
if	1
she	1
read	1
of	1
how	1
lady	1
mary	1
had	1
ridden	1
after	1
the	1
hounds	1
and	1
had	1
provoked	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
had	1
surprised	1
everyone	1
by	1
her	1
boldness	1
she	1
too	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
the	1
same	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
and	1
twisting	1
the	1
smooth	1
paper	1
knife	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
hands	1
she	1
forced	1
herself	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
hero	1
of	1
the	1
novel	1
was	1
already	1
almost	1
reaching	1
his	1
english	1
happiness	1
a	1
baronetcy	1
and	1
an	1
estate	1
and	1
anna	1
was	1
feeling	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
estate	1
when	1
she	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
but	1
what	1
had	1
he	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
what	1
have	1
i	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
in	1
injured	1
surprise	1
she	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
sank	1
against	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
tightly	1
gripping	1
the	1
paper	1
cutter	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
she	1
went	1
over	1
all	1
her	1
moscow	1
recollections	1
all	1
were	1
good	1
pleasant	1
she	1
remembered	1
the	1
ball	1
remembered	1
vronsky	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
of	1
slavish	1
adoration	1
remembered	1
all	1
her	1
conduct	1
with	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
shameful	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
in	1
her	1
memories	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
was	1
intensified	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
inner	1
voice	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
vronsky	1
were	1
saying	1
to	1
her	1
warm	1
very	1
warm	1
hot	1
well	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
resolutely	1
shifting	1
her	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
lounge	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
am	1
i	1
afraid	1
to	1
look	1
it	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
why	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
this	1
officer	1
boy	1
there	1
exist	1
or	1
can	1
exist	1
any	1
other	1
relations	1
than	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
common	1
with	1
every	1
acquaintance	1
she	1
laughed	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
book	1
again	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
definitely	1
unable	1
to	1
follow	1
what	1
she	1
read	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
paper	1
knife	1
over	1
the	1
window	1
pane	1
then	1
laid	1
its	1
smooth	1
cool	1
surface	1
to	1
her	1
cheek	1
and	1
almost	1
laughed	1
aloud	1
at	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
delight	1
that	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
cause	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
she	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
her	1
nerves	1
were	1
strings	1
being	1
strained	1
tighter	1
and	1
tighter	1
on	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
screwing	1
peg	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
eyes	1
opening	1
wider	1
and	1
wider	1
her	1
fingers	1
and	1
toes	1
twitching	1
nervously	1
something	1
within	1
oppressing	1
her	1
breathing	1
while	1
all	1
shapes	1
and	1
sounds	1
seemed	1
in	1
the	1
uncertain	1
half	1
light	1
to	1
strike	1
her	1
with	1
unaccustomed	1
vividness	1
moments	1
of	1
doubt	1
were	1
continually	1
coming	1
upon	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
uncertain	1
whether	1
the	1
train	1
were	1
going	1
forwards	1
or	1
backwards	1
or	1
were	1
standing	1
still	1
altogether	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
annushka	1
at	1
her	1
side	1
or	1
a	1
stranger	1
what	1
s	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
a	1
fur	1
cloak	1
or	1
some	1
beast	1
and	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
myself	1
myself	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
woman	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
this	1
delirium	1
but	1
something	1
drew	1
her	1
towards	1
it	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
yield	1
to	1
it	1
or	1
resist	1
it	1
at	1
will	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
rouse	1
herself	1
and	1
slipped	1
off	1
her	1
plaid	1
and	1
the	1
cape	1
of	1
her	1
warm	1
dress	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
regained	1
her	1
self	1
possession	1
and	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
thin	1
peasant	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
wearing	1
a	1
long	1
overcoat	1
with	1
buttons	1
missing	1
from	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
stoveheater	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
thermometer	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
snow	1
bursting	1
in	1
after	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
then	1
everything	1
grew	1
blurred	1
again	1
that	1
peasant	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
waist	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
gnawing	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
began	1
stretching	1
her	1
legs	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
filling	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
cloud	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fearful	1
shrieking	1
and	1
banging	1
as	1
though	1
someone	1
were	1
being	1
torn	1
to	1
pieces	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
blinding	1
dazzle	1
of	1
red	1
fire	1
before	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
wall	1
seemed	1
to	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
hide	1
everything	1
anna	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
sinking	1
down	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
terrible	1
but	1
delightful	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
muffled	1
up	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
snow	1
shouted	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
ear	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
pulled	1
herself	1
together	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
a	1
station	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
guard	1
she	1
asked	1
annushka	1
to	1
hand	1
her	1
the	1
cape	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
and	1
her	1
shawl	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
and	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
do	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
asked	1
annushka	1
yes	1
i	1
want	1
a	1
little	1
air	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
hot	1
in	1
here	1
and	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
driving	1
snow	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
rushed	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
and	1
struggled	1
with	1
her	1
over	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
she	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
struggle	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
wind	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
lying	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
gleeful	1
whistle	1
it	1
tried	1
to	1
snatch	1
her	1
up	1
and	1
bear	1
her	1
off	1
but	1
she	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
cold	1
door	1
post	1
and	1
holding	1
her	1
skirt	1
got	1
down	1
onto	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
the	1
wind	1
had	1
been	1
powerful	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
under	1
the	1
lee	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lull	1
with	1
enjoyment	1
she	1
drew	1
deep	1
breaths	1
of	1
the	1
frozen	1
snowy	1
air	1
and	1
standing	1
near	1
the	1
carriage	1
looked	1
about	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
the	1
lighted	1
station	1
chapter	1

the	1
raging	1
tempest	1
rushed	1
whistling	1
between	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
about	1
the	1
scaffolding	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
station	1
the	1
carriages	1
posts	1
people	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
snow	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
was	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
thickly	1
covered	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
there	1
would	1
come	1
a	1
lull	1
in	1
the	1
storm	1
but	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
swoop	1
down	1
again	1
with	1
such	1
onslaughts	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
to	1
stand	1
against	1
it	1
meanwhile	1
men	1
ran	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
talking	1
merrily	1
together	1
their	1
steps	1
crackling	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
as	1
they	1
continually	1
opened	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
big	1
doors	1
the	1
bent	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
glided	1
by	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
she	1
heard	1
sounds	1
of	1
a	1
hammer	1
upon	1
iron	1
hand	1
over	1
that	1
telegram	1
came	1
an	1
angry	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stormy	1
darkness	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
this	1
way	1
no	1

several	1
different	1
voices	1
shouted	1
again	1
and	1
muffled	1
figures	1
ran	1
by	1
covered	1
with	1
snow	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
with	1
lighted	1
cigarettes	1
passed	1
by	1
her	1
she	1
drew	1
one	1
more	1
deep	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
muff	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
post	1
and	1
get	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
when	1
another	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
military	1
overcoat	1
quite	1
close	1
beside	1
her	1
stepped	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
flickering	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
post	1
she	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
recognized	1
vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
putting	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
peak	1
of	1
his	1
cap	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
asked	1
was	1
there	1
anything	1
she	1
wanted	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
service	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
gazed	1
rather	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
answering	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
she	1
saw	1
or	1
fancied	1
she	1
saw	1
both	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
it	1
was	1
again	1
that	1
expression	1
of	1
reverential	1
ecstasy	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
worked	1
upon	1
her	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
herself	1
during	1
the	1
past	1
few	1
days	1
and	1
again	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
before	1
that	1
vronsky	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hundreds	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
forever	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
are	1
met	1
everywhere	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
herself	1
to	1
bestow	1
a	1
thought	1
upon	1
him	1
but	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
of	1
meeting	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
joyful	1
pride	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
she	1
knew	1
as	1
certainly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
to	1
be	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
coming	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
letting	1
fall	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
grasped	1
the	1
door	1
post	1
and	1
irrepressible	1
delight	1
and	1
eagerness	1
shone	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
coming	1
for	1
he	1
repeated	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
wind	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
surmounting	1
all	1
obstacles	1
sent	1
the	1
snow	1
flying	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
roofs	1
and	1
clanked	1
some	1
sheet	1
of	1
iron	1
it	1
had	1
torn	1
off	1
while	1
the	1
hoarse	1
whistle	1
of	1
the	1
engine	1
roared	1
in	1
front	1
plaintively	1
and	1
gloomily	1
all	1
the	1
awfulness	1
of	1
the	1
storm	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
more	1
splendid	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
what	1
her	1
soul	1
longed	1
to	1
hear	1
though	1
she	1
feared	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
reason	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
he	1
saw	1
conflict	1
forgive	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
dislike	1
what	1
i	1
said	1
he	1
said	1
humbly	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
courteously	1
deferentially	1
yet	1
so	1
firmly	1
so	1
stubbornly	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
no	1
answer	1
it	1
s	1
wrong	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
and	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
to	1
forget	1
what	1
you	1
ve	1
said	1
as	1
i	1
forget	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
not	1
one	1
word	1
not	1
one	1
gesture	1
of	1
yours	1
shall	1
i	1
could	1
i	1
ever	1
forget	1
enough	1
enough	1
she	1
cried	1
trying	1
assiduously	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
stern	1
expression	1
to	1
her	1
face	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
gazing	1
greedily	1
and	1
clutching	1
at	1
the	1
cold	1
door	1
post	1
she	1
clambered	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
got	1
rapidly	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
corridor	1
she	1
paused	1
going	1
over	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
recall	1
her	1
own	1
words	1
or	1
his	1
she	1
realized	1
instinctively	1
that	1
the	1
momentary	1
conversation	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
fearfully	1
closer	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
panic	1
stricken	1
and	1
blissful	1
at	1
it	1
after	1
standing	1
still	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
the	1
overstrained	1
condition	1
which	1
had	1
tormented	1
her	1
before	1
did	1
not	1
only	1
come	1
back	1
but	1
was	1
intensified	1
and	1
reached	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
every	1
minute	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
snap	1
within	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
excessive	1
tension	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
all	1
night	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
nervous	1
tension	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
that	1
filled	1
her	1
imagination	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
disagreeable	1
or	1
gloomy	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
blissful	1
glowing	1
and	1
exhilarating	1
towards	1
morning	1
anna	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
doze	1
sitting	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
waked	1
it	1
was	1
daylight	1
and	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
near	1
petersburg	1
at	1
once	1
thoughts	1
of	1
home	1
of	1
husband	1
and	1
of	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
at	1
petersburg	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
train	1
stopped	1
and	1
she	1
got	1
out	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
that	1
attracted	1
her	1
attention	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
oh	1
mercy	1
why	1
do	1
his	1
ears	1
look	1
like	1
that	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
frigid	1
and	1
imposing	1
figure	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
ears	1
that	1
struck	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
as	1
propping	1
up	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
his	1
round	1
hat	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
his	1
lips	1
falling	1
into	1
their	1
habitual	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
tired	1
eyes	1
looking	1
straight	1
at	1
her	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
sensation	1
gripped	1
at	1
her	1
heart	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
his	1
obstinate	1
and	1
weary	1
glance	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
different	1
she	1
was	1
especially	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
experienced	1
on	1
meeting	1
him	1
that	1
feeling	1
was	1
an	1
intimate	1
familiar	1
feeling	1
like	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
which	1
she	1
experienced	1
in	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
but	1
hitherto	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
note	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
clearly	1
and	1
painfully	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
yes	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
your	1
tender	1
spouse	1
as	1
devoted	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
after	1
marriage	1
burned	1
with	1
impatience	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
deliberate	1
high	1
pitched	1
voice	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
tone	1
which	1
he	1
almost	1
always	1
took	1
with	1
her	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
jeering	1
at	1
anyone	1
who	1
should	1
say	1
in	1
earnest	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
is	1
seryozha	1
quite	1
well	1
she	1
asked	1
and	1
is	1
this	1
all	1
the	1
reward	1
said	1
he	1
for	1
my	1
ardor	1

vronsky	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
tried	1
to	1
sleep	1
all	1
that	1
night	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
or	1
scanning	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
got	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
indeed	1
on	1
previous	1
occasions	1
struck	1
and	1
impressed	1
people	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
air	1
of	1
unhesitating	1
composure	1
he	1
seemed	1
now	1
more	1
haughty	1
and	1
self	1
possessed	1
than	1
ever	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
people	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
things	1
a	1
nervous	1
young	1
man	1
a	1
clerk	1
in	1
a	1
law	1
court	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
him	1
hated	1
him	1
for	1
that	1
look	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
asked	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
pushed	1
against	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
but	1
a	1
person	1
but	1
vronsky	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
made	1
a	1
wry	1
face	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
losing	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1
under	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
this	1
refusal	1
to	1
recognize	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
person	1
vronsky	1
saw	1
nothing	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
a	1
king	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
impression	1
on	1
anna	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
believe	1
that	1
but	1
because	1
the	1
impression	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
him	1
gave	1
him	1
happiness	1
and	1
pride	1
what	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
forces	1
hitherto	1
dissipated	1
wasted	1
were	1
centered	1
on	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
bent	1
with	1
fearful	1
energy	1
on	1
one	1
blissful	1
goal	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
at	1
it	1
he	1
knew	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
the	1
only	1
meaning	1
in	1
life	1
for	1
him	1
now	1
lay	1
in	1
seeing	1
and	1
hearing	1
her	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
at	1
bologova	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
seltzer	1
water	1
and	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
anna	1
involuntarily	1
his	1
first	1
word	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
now	1
and	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
all	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
kept	1
unceasingly	1
going	1
over	1
every	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
every	1
word	1
she	1
had	1
uttered	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
fancy	1
making	1
his	1
heart	1
faint	1
with	1
emotion	1
floated	1
pictures	1
of	1
a	1
possible	1
future	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
train	1
at	1
petersburg	1
he	1
felt	1
after	1
his	1
sleepless	1
night	1
as	1
keen	1
and	1
fresh	1
as	1
after	1
a	1
cold	1
bath	1
he	1
paused	1
near	1
his	1
compartment	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
smiling	1
unconsciously	1
once	1
more	1
i	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
walk	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
will	1
say	1
something	1
turn	1
her	1
head	1
glance	1
smile	1
maybe	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
husband	1
whom	1
the	1
station	1
master	1
was	1
deferentially	1
escorting	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
ah	1
yes	1
the	1
husband	1
only	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
did	1
vronsky	1
realize	1
clearly	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
attached	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
husband	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
husband	1
but	1
had	1
hardly	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
only	1
now	1
fully	1
believed	1
in	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
shoulders	1
and	1
his	1
legs	1
clad	1
in	1
black	1
trousers	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
this	1
husband	1
calmly	1
take	1
her	1
arm	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
property	1
seeing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
with	1
his	1
petersburg	1
face	1
and	1
severely	1
self	1
confident	1
figure	1
in	1
his	1
round	1
hat	1
with	1
his	1
rather	1
prominent	1
spine	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
sensation	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
feel	1
tortured	1
by	1
thirst	1
who	1
on	1
reaching	1
a	1
spring	1
should	1
find	1
a	1
dog	1
a	1
sheep	1
or	1
a	1
pig	1
who	1
has	1
drunk	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
muddied	1
the	1
water	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
manner	1
of	1
walking	1
with	1
a	1
swing	1
of	1
the	1
hips	1
and	1
flat	1
feet	1
particularly	1
annoyed	1
vronsky	1
he	1
could	1
recognize	1
in	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
himself	1
an	1
indubitable	1
right	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
affected	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
physically	1
reviving	1
him	1
stirring	1
him	1
and	1
filling	1
his	1
soul	1
with	1
rapture	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
german	1
valet	1
who	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
second	1
class	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
things	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
first	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
and	1
noted	1
with	1
a	1
lover	1
s	1
insight	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
slight	1
reserve	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
no	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
cannot	1
love	1
him	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
approaching	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
he	1
noticed	1
too	1
with	1
joy	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
near	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
him	1
turned	1
again	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
have	1
you	1
passed	1
a	1
good	1
night	1
he	1
asked	1
bowing	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
together	1
and	1
leaving	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
bow	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
account	1
and	1
to	1
recognize	1
it	1
or	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
fit	1
thank	1
you	1
very	1
good	1
she	1
answered	1
her	1
face	1
looked	1
weary	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
play	1
of	1
eagerness	1
in	1
it	1
peeping	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
as	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
although	1
the	1
flash	1
died	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
for	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
he	1
knew	1
vronsky	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
looked	1
at	1
vronsky	1
with	1
displeasure	1
vaguely	1
recalling	1
who	1
this	1
was	1
vronsky	1
s	1
composure	1
and	1
self	1
confidence	1
here	1
struck	1
like	1
a	1
scythe	1
against	1
a	1
stone	1
upon	1
the	1
cold	1
self	1
confidence	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
count	1
vronsky	1
said	1
anna	1
ah	1
we	1
are	1
acquainted	1
i	1
believe	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
indifferently	1
giving	1
his	1
hand	1
you	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
you	1
return	1
with	1
the	1
son	1
he	1
said	1
articulating	1
each	1
syllable	1
as	1
though	1
each	1
were	1
a	1
separate	1
favor	1
he	1
was	1
bestowing	1
you	1
re	1
back	1
from	1
leave	1
i	1
suppose	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
his	1
jesting	1
tone	1
well	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
tears	1
shed	1
at	1
moscow	1
at	1
parting	1
by	1
addressing	1
his	1
wife	1
like	1
this	1
he	1
gave	1
vronsky	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
and	1
turning	1
slightly	1
towards	1
him	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
hat	1
but	1
vronsky	1
turned	1
to	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
calling	1
on	1
you	1

said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
glanced	1
with	1
his	1
weary	1
eyes	1
at	1
vronsky	1
delighted	1
he	1
said	1
coldly	1
on	1
mondays	1
we	1
re	1
at	1
home	1
most	1
fortunate	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
dismissing	1
vronsky	1
altogether	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
just	1
have	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
prove	1
my	1
devotion	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
jesting	1
tone	1
you	1
lay	1
too	1
much	1
stress	1
on	1
your	1
devotion	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
value	1
it	1
much	1
she	1
responded	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
jesting	1
tone	1
involuntarily	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
vronsky	1
s	1
steps	1
behind	1
them	1
but	1
what	1
has	1
it	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
asking	1
her	1

in	1
anna	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1

better	1
than	1

down	1

the	1

enjoy	1
him	1

almost	1
physical	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
his	1
nearness	1
and	1
his	1
caresses	1
and	1
moral	1
soothing	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
his	1
simple	1
confiding	1
and	1
loving	1
glance	1
and	1
heard	1

naïve	1
questions	1

out	1
the	1

so	1
nice	1
as	1
she	1
asked	1

when	1
the	1

was	1
announced	1
the	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
stout	1
woman	1
with	1
an	1
unhealthily	1
sallow	1
face	1
and	1
splendid	1
pensive	1
black	1
eyes	1
anna	1
liked	1
her	1
but	1
today	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
seeing	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
defects	1
well	1
my	1
dear	1
so	1
you	1
took	1
the	1
olive	1
branch	1
inquired	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
over	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
much	1
less	1
serious	1
than	1
we	1
had	1
supposed	1
answered	1
anna	1
my	1
belle	1
sœur	1
is	1
in	1
general	1
too	1
hasty	1
but	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
everything	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
concern	1
her	1
had	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
never	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
interested	1
her	1
she	1
interrupted	1
anna	1
yes	1
there	1
s	1
plenty	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
worried	1
today	1
oh	1
why	1
asked	1
anna	1
trying	1
to	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
i	1
m	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
weary	1
of	1
fruitlessly	1
championing	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
sometimes	1
i	1
m	1
quite	1
unhinged	1
by	1
it	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
sisters	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
religiously	1
patriotic	1
philanthropic	1
institution	1
was	1
going	1
splendidly	1
but	1
with	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
added	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
ironical	1
submission	1
to	1
destiny	1
they	1
pounce	1
on	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
distort	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
work	1
it	1
out	1
so	1
pettily	1
and	1
unworthily	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
people	1
your	1
husband	1
among	1
them	1
understand	1
all	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1

the	1
others	1
simply	1
drag	1
it	1
down	1
yesterday	1
pravdin	1
wrote	1
to	1
me	1
pravdin	1

a	1
well	1
known	1
panslavist	1
abroad	1
and	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
described	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
then	1
the	1
countess	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
more	1
disagreements	1
and	1
intrigues	1
against	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
unification	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
and	1
departed	1
in	1
haste	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
some	1
society	1
and	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
slavonic	1
committee	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
before	1
of	1

why	1
was	1
it	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
notice	1
it	1
before	1
anna	1
asked	1
herself	1
or	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
very	1
much	1
irritated	1
today	1
it	1
s	1
really	1
ludicrous	1
her	1
object	1
is	1
doing	1
good	1
she	1
a	1
christian	1
yet	1
she	1
s	1
always	1
angry	1
and	1
she	1
always	1
has	1
enemies	1

all	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
at	1
three	1

she	1

at	1
the	1

spent	1
the	1
time	1
till	1
dinner	1
in	1
assisting	1
at	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
dinner	1
he	1
dined	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
parents	1
and	1
in	1
putting	1
her	1
things	1
in	1
order	1
and	1
in	1
reading	1
and	1
answering	1
the	1
notes	1
and	1
letters	1
which	1
had	1
accumulated	1
on	1
her	1
table	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
causeless	1
shame	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
on	1
the	1
journey	1
and	1
her	1
excitement	1
too	1
had	1
completely	1
vanished	1
in	1
the	1
habitual	1
conditions	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
she	1
felt	1
again	1
resolute	1
and	1
irreproachable	1
she	1
recalled	1
with	1
wonder	1
her	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
nothing	1
vronsky	1
said	1
something	1
silly	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
and	1
i	1
answered	1
as	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
husband	1
would	1
be	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
attach	1
importance	1
to	1
what	1
has	1
no	1
importance	1
she	1
remembered	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
husband	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
declaration	1
made	1
her	1
at	1
petersburg	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
subordinates	1
and	1
how	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
answered	1
that	1
every	1
woman	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
exposed	1
to	1
such	1
incidents	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
fullest	1
confidence	1
in	1
her	1
tact	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
lower	1
her	1
and	1
himself	1
by	1
jealousy	1
so	1
then	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
indeed	1
thank	1
god	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
she	1
told	1
herself	1

as	1

the	1
people	1

for	1
him	1
with	1

in	1
wearing	1
a	1
white	1

and	1
evening	1

with	1
two	1
stars	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
directly	1
after	1
dinner	1
every	1
minute	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
life	1
was	1
portioned	1
out	1
and	1
occupied	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
all	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
adhered	1
to	1
the	1
strictest	1
punctuality	1
unhasting	1
and	1
unresting	1
was	1
his	1
motto	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
hall	1
greeted	1
everyone	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
sat	1
down	1
smiling	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
yes	1
my	1
solitude	1
is	1
over	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
how	1
uncomfortable	1
he	1
laid	1
stress	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
uncomfortable	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
dine	1
alone	1
at	1
dinner	1
he	1
talked	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
about	1
moscow	1
matters	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
asked	1
her	1
after	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
but	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
general	1
dealing	1
with	1
petersburg	1
official	1
and	1
public	1
news	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
spent	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
with	1
his	1
guests	1
and	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
pressed	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
hand	1
withdrew	1
and	1
drove	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
council	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
that	1
evening	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
betsy	1
tverskaya	1
who	1
hearing	1
of	1
her	1
return	1
had	1
invited	1
her	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
theater	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
box	1
for	1
that	1
evening	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
principally	1
because	1
the	1
dress	1
she	1
had	1
reckoned	1
upon	1
was	1
not	1
ready	1
altogether	1
anna	1
on	1
turning	1
after	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
her	1
guests	1
to	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
her	1
attire	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
annoyed	1
she	1
was	1
generally	1
a	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
dressing	1
well	1
without	1
great	1
expense	1
and	1
before	1
leaving	1
moscow	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
dressmaker	1
three	1
dresses	1
to	1
transform	1
the	1
dresses	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
altered	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
recognized	1
and	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
ready	1
three	1
days	1
before	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
two	1
dresses	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
done	1
at	1
all	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
altered	1
as	1
anna	1
had	1
intended	1
the	1
dressmaker	1
came	1
to	1
explain	1
declaring	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
and	1
anna	1
was	1
so	1
furious	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
afterwards	1
to	1
regain	1
her	1
serenity	1
completely	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
with	1
her	1
son	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
bed	1
herself	1
signed	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
tucked	1
him	1
up	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
out	1
anywhere	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
so	1
well	1
she	1
felt	1
so	1
light	1
hearted	1
and	1
serene	1
she	1
saw	1
so	1
clearly	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
important	1
on	1
her	1
railway	1
journey	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
trivial	1
incidents	1
of	1
fashionable	1
life	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
before	1
anyone	1
else	1
or	1
before	1
herself	1
anna	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
hearth	1
with	1
an	1
english	1
novel	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
exactly	1
at	1
half	1
past	1
nine	1
she	1
heard	1
his	1
ring	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
observed	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
altogether	1
then	1
i	1
see	1
your	1
visit	1
was	1
a	1
success	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
oh	1
yes	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
about	1
everything	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
her	1
journey	1
with	1
countess	1
vronskaya	1
her	1
arrival	1
the	1
accident	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
then	1
she	1
described	1
the	1
pity	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
first	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
afterwards	1
for	1
dolly	1
i	1
imagine	1
one	1
cannot	1
exonerate	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
blame	1
though	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
brother	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
severely	1
anna	1
smiled	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
simply	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
family	1
considerations	1
could	1
not	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1
expressing	1
his	1
genuine	1
opinion	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
characteristic	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
liked	1
it	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
it	1
has	1
all	1
ended	1
so	1
satisfactorily	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
back	1
again	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
come	1
what	1
do	1
they	1
say	1
about	1
the	1
new	1
act	1
i	1
have	1
got	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
council	1
anna	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
this	1
act	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
conscience	1
stricken	1
at	1
having	1
been	1
able	1
so	1
readily	1
to	1
forget	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
such	1
importance	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
other	1

to	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

knew	1
his	1

a	1
necessity	1
of	1

swallowed	1
up	1
almost	1
the	1

hopelessly	1
in	1

locked	1
up	1
after	1

addressing	1

whom	1
she	1
called	1
pierre	1

a	1
contraction	1
of	1

the	1
baroness	1
detaining	1

telling	1
him	1
with	1
many	1
jokes	1
about	1
her	1
last	1
new	1
plans	1
of	1

asking	1
his	1

contemptuously	1

wants	1
to	1

the	1

of	1
my	1

vronsky	1
heard	1
with	1
pleasure	1
this	1
light	1
hearted	1
prattle	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
agreed	1
with	1
her	1
gave	1
her	1
half	1
joking	1
counsel	1
and	1
altogether	1
dropped	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
tone	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
such	1
women	1
in	1
his	1
petersburg	1
world	1
all	1
people	1
were	1
divided	1
into	1
utterly	1
opposed	1
classes	1
one	1
the	1
lower	1
class	1
vulgar	1
stupid	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
ridiculous	1
people	1
who	1
believe	1
that	1
one	1
husband	1
ought	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
the	1
one	1
wife	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
lawfully	1
married	1
that	1
a	1
girl	1
should	1
be	1
innocent	1
a	1
woman	1
modest	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
manly	1
self	1
controlled	1
and	1
strong	1
that	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
one	1
s	1
children	1
earn	1
one	1
s	1
bread	1
and	1
pay	1
one	1
s	1
debts	1
and	1
various	1
similar	1
absurdities	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
old	1
fashioned	1
and	1
ridiculous	1
people	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
class	1
of	1
people	1
the	1
real	1
people	1
to	1
this	1
class	1
they	1
all	1
belonged	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
great	1
thing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
elegant	1
generous	1
plucky	1
gay	1
to	1
abandon	1
oneself	1
without	1
a	1
blush	1
to	1
every	1
passion	1
and	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
everything	1
else	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
only	1
vronsky	1
was	1
startled	1
after	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
world	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
moscow	1
but	1
immediately	1
as	1
though	1
slipping	1
his	1
feet	1
into	1
old	1
slippers	1
he	1
dropped	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
hearted	1
pleasant	1
world	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
coffee	1
was	1
never	1
really	1
made	1
but	1
spluttered	1
over	1
everyone	1
and	1
boiled	1
away	1
doing	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
required	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
is	1
providing	1
much	1
cause	1
for	1
much	1
noise	1
and	1
laughter	1
and	1
spoiling	1
a	1
costly	1
rug	1
and	1
the	1
baroness	1
s	1
gown	1
well	1
now	1
good	1
bye	1
or	1
you	1
ll	1
never	1
get	1
washed	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
have	1
on	1
my	1
conscience	1
the	1
worst	1
sin	1
a	1
gentleman	1
can	1
commit	1
so	1
you	1
would	1
advise	1
a	1
knife	1
to	1
his	1
throat	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
and	1
manage	1
that	1
your	1
hand	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
his	1
lips	1
he	1
ll	1
kiss	1
your	1
hand	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
end	1
satisfactorily	1
answered	1
vronsky	1
so	1
at	1
the	1
français	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
rustle	1
of	1
her	1
skirts	1
she	1
vanished	1
kamerovsky	1
got	1
up	1
too	1
and	1
vronsky	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
shook	1
hands	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
dressing	1
room	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
washing	1
petritsky	1
described	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
brief	1
outlines	1
his	1
position	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
vronsky	1
had	1
left	1
petersburg	1
no	1
money	1
at	1
all	1
his	1
father	1
said	1
he	1
wouldn	1
t	1
give	1
him	1
any	1
and	1
pay	1
his	1
debts	1
his	1
tailor	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
locked	1
up	1
and	1
another	1
fellow	1
too	1

with	1
the	1

1	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
in	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
a	1
consultation	1
was	1
being	1
held	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
pronounce	1
on	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
health	1
and	1
the	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
restore	1
her	1
failing	1
strength	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
ill	1
and	1
as	1
spring	1
came	1
on	1
she	1
grew	1
worse	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
gave	1
her	1
cod	1
liver	1
oil	1
then	1
iron	1
then	1
nitrate	1
of	1
silver	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
were	1
alike	1
in	1
doing	1
no	1
good	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
advice	1
when	1
spring	1
came	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
a	1
celebrated	1
physician	1
was	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
celebrated	1
physician	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
man	1
still	1
youngish	1
asked	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
patient	1
he	1
maintained	1
with	1
peculiar	1
satisfaction	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
maiden	1
modesty	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
relic	1
of	1
barbarism	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
still	1
youngish	1
to	1
handle	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
naked	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
natural	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
felt	1
and	1
thought	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
no	1
harm	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
and	1
consequently	1
he	1
considered	1
modesty	1
in	1
the	1
girl	1
not	1
merely	1
as	1
a	1
relic	1
of	1
barbarism	1
but	1
also	1
as	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
himself	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
submit	1
since	1
although	1
all	1
the	1
doctors	1
had	1
studied	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
school	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
same	1
books	1
and	1
learned	1
the	1
same	1
science	1
and	1
though	1
some	1
people	1
said	1
this	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
doctor	1
in	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
household	1
and	1
circle	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
accepted	1
that	1
this	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
alone	1
had	1
some	1
special	1
knowledge	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
save	1
kitty	1
after	1
a	1
careful	1
examination	1
and	1
sounding	1
of	1
the	1
bewildered	1
patient	1
dazed	1
with	1
shame	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
having	1
scrupulously	1
washed	1
his	1
hands	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
the	1
prince	1
frowned	1
and	1
coughed	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
something	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
neither	1
a	1
fool	1
nor	1
an	1
invalid	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
faith	1
in	1
medicine	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
furious	1
at	1
the	1
whole	1
farce	1
specially	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
perhaps	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
fully	1
comprehended	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
illness	1
conceited	1
blockhead	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
s	1
chatter	1
about	1
his	1
daughter	1
s	1
symptoms	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
meantime	1
with	1
difficulty	1
restraining	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
this	1
old	1
gentleman	1
and	1
with	1
difficulty	1
condescending	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
his	1
intelligence	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
principal	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
mother	1
before	1
her	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
scatter	1
his	1
pearls	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
the	1
prince	1
withdrew	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
ridiculous	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
whole	1
performance	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
distracted	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
had	1
sinned	1
against	1
kitty	1
well	1
doctor	1
decide	1
our	1
fate	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
tell	1
me	1
everything	1
is	1
there	1
hope	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
her	1
lips	1
quivered	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
the	1
question	1
well	1
doctor	1
immediately	1
princess	1
i	1
will	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
my	1
colleague	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
laying	1
my	1
opinion	1
before	1
you	1
so	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
leave	1
you	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
the	1
princess	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
when	1
the	1
doctors	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
began	1
timidly	1
explaining	1
his	1
opinion	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
commencement	1
of	1
tuberculous	1
trouble	1
but	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
sentence	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
big	1
gold	1
watch	1
yes	1
said	1
he	1
but	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
respectfully	1
ceased	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
observations	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
tuberculous	1
process	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
aware	1
able	1
to	1
define	1
till	1
there	1
are	1
cavities	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
definite	1
but	1
we	1
may	1
suspect	1
it	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
indications	1
malnutrition	1
nervous	1
excitability	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
question	1
stands	1
thus	1
in	1
presence	1
of	1
indications	1
of	1
tuberculous	1
process	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
maintain	1
nutrition	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
moral	1
spiritual	1
causes	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
in	1
these	1
cases	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
permitted	1
himself	1
to	1
interpolate	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
an	1
understood	1
thing	1
responded	1
the	1
celebrated	1
physician	1
again	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
beg	1
pardon	1
is	1
the	1
yausky	1
bridge	1
done	1
yet	1
or	1
shall	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
drive	1
around	1
he	1
asked	1
ah	1
it	1
is	1
oh	1
well	1
then	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
so	1
we	1
were	1
saying	1
the	1
problem	1
may	1
be	1
put	1
thus	1
to	1
maintain	1
nutrition	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
tone	1
to	1
the	1
nerves	1
the	1
one	1
is	1
in	1
close	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
must	1
attack	1
both	1
sides	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
how	1
about	1
a	1
tour	1
abroad	1
asked	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
i	1
ve	1
no	1
liking	1
for	1
foreign	1
tours	1
and	1
take	1
note	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
early	1
stage	1
of	1
tuberculous	1
process	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
be	1
certain	1
a	1
foreign	1
tour	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
what	1
is	1
wanted	1
is	1
means	1
of	1
improving	1
nutrition	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
lowering	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
expounded	1
his	1
plan	1
of	1
treatment	1
with	1
soden	1
waters	1
a	1
remedy	1
obviously	1
prescribed	1
primarily	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
harm	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
listened	1
attentively	1
and	1
respectfully	1
but	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
foreign	1
travel	1
i	1
would	1
urge	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
habits	1
the	1
removal	1
from	1
conditions	1
calling	1
up	1
reminiscences	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
mother	1
wishes	1
it	1
he	1
added	1
ah	1
well	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
only	1
those	1
german	1
quacks	1
are	1
mischievous	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
well	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
then	1
he	1
glanced	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
oh	1
time	1
s	1
up	1
already	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
announced	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
from	1
him	1
dictated	1
his	1
doing	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
patient	1
once	1
more	1
what	1
another	1
examination	1
cried	1
the	1
mother	1
with	1
horror	1
oh	1
no	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
details	1
princess	1
come	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
doctor	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
kitty	1
wasted	1
and	1
flushed	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
glitter	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
left	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
shame	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
through	1
kitty	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
when	1
the	1
doctor	1
came	1
in	1
she	1
flushed	1
crimson	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
all	1
her	1
illness	1
and	1
treatment	1
struck	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
stupid	1
ludicrous	1
even	1
doctoring	1
her	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
absurd	1
as	1
putting	1
together	1
the	1
pieces	1
of	1
a	1
broken	1
vase	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
broken	1
why	1
would	1
they	1
try	1
to	1
cure	1
her	1
with	1
pills	1
and	1
powders	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
grieve	1
her	1
mother	1
especially	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
considered	1
herself	1
to	1
blame	1
may	1
i	1
trouble	1
you	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
princess	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
facing	1
her	1
felt	1
her	1
pulse	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
asking	1
her	1
tiresome	1
questions	1
she	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
got	1
up	1
furious	1
excuse	1
me	1
doctor	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
really	1
no	1
object	1
in	1
this	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
you	1
ve	1
asked	1
me	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
offense	1
nervous	1
irritability	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
when	1
kitty	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
however	1
i	1
had	1
finished	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
began	1
scientifically	1
explaining	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
as	1
an	1
exceptionally	1
intelligent	1
woman	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
princess	1
and	1
concluded	1
by	1
insisting	1
on	1
the	1
drinking	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
which	1
were	1
certainly	1
harmless	1
at	1
the	1
question	1
should	1
they	1
go	1
abroad	1
the	1
doctor	1
plunged	1
into	1
deep	1
meditation	1
as	1
though	1
resolving	1
a	1
weighty	1
problem	1
finally	1
his	1
decision	1
was	1
pronounced	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
but	1
to	1
put	1
no	1
faith	1
in	1
foreign	1
quacks	1
and	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
any	1
need	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
piece	1
of	1
good	1
fortune	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
gone	1
the	1
mother	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
cheerful	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
kitty	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
cheerful	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
almost	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
pretending	1
now	1
really	1
i	1
m	1
quite	1
well	1
mamma	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
tour	1
she	1
began	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
chapter	1
2	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
doctor	1
dolly	1
had	1
arrived	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
consultation	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
up	1
after	1
her	1
confinement	1
she	1
had	1
another	1
baby	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
born	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
trouble	1
and	1
anxiety	1
enough	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
tiny	1
baby	1
and	1
a	1
sick	1
child	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
hear	1
kitty	1
s	1
fate	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
that	1
day	1
well	1
well	1
she	1
said	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
hat	1
you	1
re	1
all	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
good	1
news	1
then	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
what	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
said	1
but	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
talked	1
distinctly	1
enough	1
and	1
at	1
great	1
length	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
to	1
report	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
the	1
only	1
point	1
of	1
interest	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
abroad	1
dolly	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
sighing	1
her	1
dearest	1
friend	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
and	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
cheerful	1
one	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
after	1
their	1
reconciliation	1
had	1
become	1
humiliating	1
the	1
union	1
anna	1
had	1
cemented	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
solid	1
character	1
and	1
family	1
harmony	1
was	1
breaking	1
down	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
nothing	1
definite	1
but	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
hardly	1
ever	1
at	1
home	1
money	1
too	1
was	1
hardly	1
ever	1
forthcoming	1
and	1
dolly	1
was	1
continually	1
tortured	1
by	1
suspicions	1
of	1
infidelity	1
which	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
dismiss	1
dreading	1
the	1
agonies	1
of	1
jealousy	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
through	1
already	1
the	1
first	1
onslaught	1
of	1
jealousy	1
once	1
lived	1
through	1
could	1
never	1
come	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
infidelities	1
could	1
never	1
now	1
affect	1
her	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
such	1
a	1
discovery	1
now	1
would	1
only	1
mean	1
breaking	1
up	1
family	1
habits	1
and	1
she	1
let	1
herself	1
be	1
deceived	1
despising	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
weakness	1
besides	1
this	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
large	1
family	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
worry	1
to	1
her	1
first	1
the	1
nursing	1
of	1
her	1
young	1
baby	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
well	1
then	1
the	1
nurse	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
now	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
had	1
fallen	1
ill	1
well	1
how	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
asked	1
her	1
mother	1
ah	1
mamma	1
we	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
troubles	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
lili	1
is	1
ill	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
it	1
s	1
scarlatina	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
here	1
now	1
to	1
hear	1
about	1
kitty	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
shall	1
shut	1
myself	1
up	1
entirely	1
if	1
god	1
forbid	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
scarlatina	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
too	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
from	1
his	1
study	1
after	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
departure	1
and	1
after	1
presenting	1
his	1
cheek	1
to	1
dolly	1
and	1
saying	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
settled	1
it	1
you	1
re	1
going	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
suppose	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
stay	1
here	1
alexander	1
said	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
s	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
mamma	1
why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
father	1
come	1
with	1
us	1
said	1
kitty	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
nicer	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
us	1
too	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
stroked	1
kitty	1
s	1
hair	1
she	1
lifted	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
smile	1
it	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
her	1
better	1
than	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
much	1
about	1
her	1
being	1
the	1
youngest	1
she	1
was	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
favorite	1
and	1
she	1
fancied	1
that	1
his	1
love	1
gave	1
him	1
insight	1
when	1
now	1
her	1
glance	1
met	1
his	1
blue	1
kindly	1
eyes	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
her	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
right	1
through	1
her	1
and	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
good	1
that	1
was	1
passing	1
within	1
her	1
reddening	1
she	1
stretched	1
out	1
towards	1
him	1
expecting	1
a	1
kiss	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
patted	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
said	1
these	1
stupid	1
chignons	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
getting	1
at	1
the	1
real	1
daughter	1
one	1
simply	1
strokes	1
the	1
bristles	1
of	1
dead	1
women	1
well	1
dolinka	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
elder	1
daughter	1
what	1
s	1
your	1
young	1
buck	1
about	1
hey	1
nothing	1
father	1
answered	1
dolly	1
understanding	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
meant	1
he	1
s	1
always	1
out	1
i	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
see	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
adding	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
why	1
hasn	1
t	1
he	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
yet	1
to	1
see	1
about	1
selling	1
that	1
forest	1
no	1
he	1
s	1
still	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
oh	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
so	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
be	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
journey	1
too	1
at	1
your	1
service	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
sitting	1
down	1
and	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
katia	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
younger	1
daughter	1
you	1
must	1
wake	1
up	1
one	1
fine	1
day	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
yourself	1
why	1
i	1
m	1
quite	1
well	1
and	1
merry	1
and	1
going	1
out	1
again	1
with	1
father	1
for	1
an	1
early	1
morning	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
frost	1
hey	1
what	1
her	1
father	1
said	1
seemed	1
simple	1
enough	1
yet	1
at	1
these	1
words	1
kitty	1
became	1
confused	1
and	1
overcome	1
like	1
a	1
detected	1
criminal	1
yes	1
he	1
sees	1
it	1
all	1
he	1
understands	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
s	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
though	1
i	1
m	1
ashamed	1
i	1
must	1
get	1
over	1
my	1
shame	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
pluck	1
up	1
spirit	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
answer	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
begin	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
and	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
see	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
your	1
jokes	1
the	1
princess	1
pounced	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
you	1
re	1
always	1
she	1
began	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
reproaches	1
the	1
prince	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
scolding	1
rather	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
without	1
speaking	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frowning	1
she	1
s	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
poor	1
child	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
and	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
feel	1
how	1
it	1
hurts	1
her	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
slightest	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
ah	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
mistaken	1
in	1
people	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
tone	1
both	1
dolly	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
knew	1

speaking	1
of	1

base	1
dishonorable	1
people	1
ah	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
gloomily	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
low	1
chair	1
and	1
seeming	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
yet	1
stopping	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
there	1
are	1
laws	1
madam	1
and	1
since	1
you	1
ve	1
challenged	1
me	1
to	1

and	1
call	1
in	1
these	1
quacks	1
the	1
prince	1
apparently	1
had	1
plenty	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
princess	1
heard	1
his	1
tone	1
she	1
subsided	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
became	1
penitent	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
on	1
serious	1
occasions	1
alexander	1
alexander	1
she	1
whispered	1
moving	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
weep	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
the	1
prince	1
too	1
calmed	1
down	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
there	1
that	1
s	1
enough	1
that	1
s	1
enough	1

be	1
helped	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
great	1
harm	1
done	1
god	1
is	1
merciful	1
thanks	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
responded	1
to	1
the	1
tearful	1
kiss	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
this	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
kitty	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
tears	1
dolly	1
with	1
her	1
motherly	1
family	1
instincts	1
had	1
promptly	1
perceived	1
that	1
here	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
work	1
lay	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
prepared	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
she	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
hat	1
and	1
morally	1
speaking	1
tucked	1
up	1
her	1
sleeves	1
and	1
prepared	1
for	1
action	1
while	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
attacking	1
her	1
father	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
mother	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
filial	1
reverence	1
would	1
allow	1
during	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
outburst	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
she	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
for	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
tender	1
towards	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
so	1
quickly	1
being	1
kind	1
again	1
but	1
when	1
her	1
father	1
left	1
them	1
she	1
made	1
ready	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
needful	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
kitty	1
and	1
console	1
her	1
i	1
d	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
something	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1

make	1
kitty	1
an	1
offer	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
he	1
told	1
stiva	1
so	1
well	1
what	1
then	1
i	1
don	1

kitty	1
perhaps	1
refuse	1
him	1

no	1
she	1
has	1
said	1
nothing	1

all	1
on	1

refused	1
him	1
if	1

for	1
the	1
other	1
i	1

and	1
then	1
he	1
has	1
deceived	1
her	1
so	1
horribly	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
terrible	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
sinned	1
against	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
she	1
broke	1
out	1
angrily	1
oh	1

t	1
understand	1
nowadays	1
they	1

way	1
and	1
mothers	1

the	1

with	1
what	1

her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
immovably	1
on	1

corner	1

at	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
rather	1
ill	1
tempered	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
i	1

down	1
beside	1
her	1
i	1

to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
what	1

swiftly	1
lifting	1
her	1
head	1
in	1
dismay	1
what	1
should	1
it	1
be	1

your	1
trouble	1

a	1
stern	1
expression	1

s	1
not	1
worth	1
your	1
grieving	1
over	1
him	1
pursued	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
coming	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
no	1
because	1
he	1
has	1
treated	1
me	1
with	1
contempt	1
said	1
kitty	1
in	1
a	1
breaking	1
voice	1
don	1

of	1
it	1

you	1
so	1
no	1
one	1

said	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
certain	1
he	1
was	1
in	1

with	1
you	1

would	1
still	1
be	1
in	1

with	1
you	1
if	1
it	1

oh	1
the	1
most	1
awful	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
me	1
is	1
this	1
sympathizing	1
shrieked	1
kitty	1
suddenly	1
flying	1
into	1
a	1
passion	1
she	1
turned	1
round	1
on	1
her	1
chair	1
flushed	1
crimson	1
and	1
rapidly	1
moving	1
her	1
fingers	1
pinched	1
the	1
clasp	1
of	1
her	1
belt	1
first	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
dolly	1
knew	1
this	1
trick	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
of	1
clenching	1
her	1
hands	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
excited	1
she	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
in	1
moments	1
of	1
excitement	1
kitty	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
forgetting	1
herself	1
and	1
saying	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
dolly	1
would	1
have	1
soothed	1
her	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
what	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
feel	1
eh	1
said	1
kitty	1
quickly	1
that	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
didn	1

for	1
me	1

that	1
i	1
m	1
dying	1
of	1

for	1
him	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
sister	1
who	1
imagines	1
that	1
that	1
that	1
she	1

i	1

and	1
humbug	1
kitty	1
you	1

you	1
tormenting	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
i	1
see	1
you	1

unhappy	1
but	1
kitty	1
in	1
her	1
fury	1
did	1
not	1

her	1
i	1
ve	1
nothing	1
to	1
grieve	1
over	1
and	1
be	1
comforted	1
about	1
i	1
am	1
too	1
proud	1
ever	1

myself	1
to	1

for	1
a	1
man	1
who	1

taking	1
her	1
by	1
the	1

me	1
did	1
levin	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
name	1
seemed	1
to	1
deprive	1
kitty	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
vestige	1
of	1
self	1
control	1
she	1
leaped	1
up	1
from	1
her	1
chair	1
and	1
flinging	1
her	1
clasp	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
she	1
gesticulated	1
rapidly	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
said	1
why	1
bring	1
levin	1
in	1
too	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
torment	1
me	1
for	1
i	1
ve	1
told	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
say	1
it	1
again	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
some	1
pride	1
and	1
never	1
never	1
would	1
i	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
doing	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
s	1
deceived	1
you	1
who	1
has	1
cared	1
for	1
another	1
woman	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
you	1
may	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
and	1
saying	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
dolly	1
sat	1
silent	1
her	1
head	1
mournfully	1
bowed	1
kitty	1
instead	1
of	1
running	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
sat	1
down	1
near	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
the	1
silence	1
lasted	1
for	1
two	1
minutes	1
dolly	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
herself	1
that	1
humiliation	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
conscious	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
bitterness	1
when	1
her	1
sister	1
reminded	1
her	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
looked	1
for	1
such	1
cruelty	1
in	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
suddenly	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
a	1
skirt	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
heart	1
rending	1
smothered	1
sobbing	1
and	1
felt	1
arms	1
about	1
her	1
neck	1
kitty	1
was	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
before	1
her	1
dolinka	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
so	1
wretched	1
she	1
whispered	1
penitently	1
and	1
the	1
sweet	1
face	1
covered	1
with	1
tears	1
hid	1
itself	1
in	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
skirt	1
as	1
though	1
tears	1
were	1
the	1
indispensable	1
oil	1
without	1
which	1
the	1
machinery	1
of	1
mutual	1
confidence	1
could	1
not	1
run	1
smoothly	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
sisters	1
the	1
sisters	1
after	1
their	1
tears	1
talked	1
not	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
uppermost	1
in	1
their	1
minds	1
but	1
though	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
outside	1
matters	1
they	1
understood	1
each	1
other	1
kitty	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
had	1
uttered	1
in	1
anger	1
about	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
infidelity	1
and	1
her	1
humiliating	1
position	1
had	1
cut	1
her	1
poor	1
sister	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
forgiven	1
her	1
dolly	1
for	1
her	1
part	1
knew	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
she	1
felt	1
certain	1
that	1
her	1
surmises	1
were	1
correct	1
that	1
kitty	1
s	1
misery	1
her	1
inconsolable	1
misery	1
was	1
due	1
precisely	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
levin	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
refused	1
him	1
and	1
vronsky	1
had	1
deceived	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
fully	1
prepared	1
to	1
love	1
levin	1
and	1
to	1
detest	1
vronsky	1
kitty	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
talked	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
miserable	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
calmer	1
but	1
can	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
everything	1
has	1
become	1
hateful	1
loathsome	1
coarse	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
myself	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
what	1
loathsome	1
thoughts	1
i	1
have	1
about	1
everything	1
why	1
whatever	1
loathsome	1
thoughts	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
asked	1
dolly	1
smiling	1
the	1
most	1
utterly	1
loathsome	1
and	1
coarse	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
unhappiness	1
or	1
low	1
spirits	1
but	1
much	1
worse	1
as	1
though	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
me	1
was	1
all	1
hidden	1
away	1
and	1
nothing	1
was	1
left	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
loathsome	1
come	1
how	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1

went	1
on	1

the	1
puzzled	1

in	1

began	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
me	1
just	1
now	1

all	1
i	1
want	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
mother	1
takes	1
me	1
to	1
a	1

to	1

only	1
takes	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
me	1
married	1
off	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
and	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
me	1
i	1
know	1
it	1

not	1
the	1
truth	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
drive	1
away	1
such	1
thoughts	1

as	1
they	1
call	1
them	1
i	1
can	1

to	1
me	1
they	1

taking	1
stock	1
of	1
me	1

me	1
up	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere	1
in	1
a	1
ball	1

joy	1
to	1

myself	1
now	1

ashamed	1
and	1
awkward	1
and	1
then	1
the	1

then	1
kitty	1
hesitated	1

wanted	1
to	1
say	1
further	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
this	1
change	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
her	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
become	1
insufferably	1
repulsive	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
grossest	1
and	1
most	1
hideous	1
conceptions	1
rising	1
before	1
her	1
imagination	1
oh	1
well	1
everything	1
presents	1
itself	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
coarsest	1
most	1
loathsome	1
light	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
that	1
s	1
my	1
illness	1
perhaps	1
it	1
will	1
pass	1
off	1
but	1
you	1
mustn	1

about	1
it	1

she	1

since	1
her	1

to	1
moscow	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
avoided	1

went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
fashionable	1

there	1
she	1
met	1
vronsky	1
and	1
experienced	1
an	1
agitating	1
joy	1
at	1
those	1
meetings	1
she	1
met	1
vronsky	1
specially	1
often	1
at	1
betsy	1
s	1
for	1
betsy	1
was	1
a	1
vronsky	1
by	1
birth	1
and	1
his	1
cousin	1
vronsky	1
was	1
everywhere	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
chance	1
of	1
meeting	1
anna	1
and	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
encouragement	1
but	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
met	1
him	1
there	1
surged	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
that	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
quickened	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
her	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
railway	1
carriage	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
herself	1
that	1
her	1
delight	1
sparkled	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
curved	1
her	1
lips	1
into	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
quench	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
this	1
delight	1
at	1
first	1
anna	1
sincerely	1
believed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
displeased	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
daring	1
to	1
pursue	1
her	1
soon	1
after	1
her	1
return	1
from	1
moscow	1
on	1
arriving	1
at	1
a	1
soirée	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
him	1
there	1
she	1
realized	1
distinctly	1
from	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
disappointment	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
deceiving	1
herself	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
pursuit	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
not	1
distasteful	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
the	1
whole	1
interest	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
the	1
celebrated	1
singer	1

singing	1
for	1
the	1

went	1
to	1
her	1
box	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1

she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
i	1

at	1
the	1
second	1
sight	1
of	1
lovers	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
she	1
wasn	1
t	1
there	1
but	1
come	1
after	1
the	1
opera	1
vronsky	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
her	1
she	1
nodded	1
he	1
thanked	1
her	1
by	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
but	1
how	1
i	1
remember	1
your	1
jeers	1
continued	1
princess	1
betsy	1
who	1
took	1
a	1
peculiar	1
pleasure	1
in	1
following	1
up	1
this	1
passion	1
to	1
a	1
successful	1
issue	1
what	1

dear	1
boy	1
that	1
s	1
my	1
one	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
caught	1
answered	1
vronsky	1
with	1
his	1
serene	1
good	1
humored	1
smile	1
if	1
i	1
complain	1
of	1
anything	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
caught	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1

begin	1
to	1
lose	1
hope	1
why	1
whatever	1
hope	1

you	1
have	1
said	1
betsy	1
offended	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
her	1
friend	1
entendons	1

	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
there	1
were	1
gleams	1
of	1
light	1
that	1
betrayed	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
perfectly	1
and	1
precisely	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
what	1
hope	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
none	1
whatever	1
said	1
vronsky	1
laughing	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
even	1
rows	1
of	1
teeth	1
excuse	1
me	1
he	1
added	1
taking	1
an	1
opera	1
glass	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
proceeding	1
to	1
scrutinize	1
over	1
her	1
bare	1
shoulder	1
the	1
row	1
of	1
boxes	1
facing	1
them	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
i	1
m	1
becoming	1
ridiculous	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
ran	1
no	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
ridiculous	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
betsy	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
fashionable	1
people	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
an	1
unsuccessful	1
lover	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
woman	1
free	1
to	1
marry	1
might	1
be	1
ridiculous	1
but	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
pursuing	1
a	1
married	1
woman	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
everything	1
staking	1
his	1

something	1
fine	1
and	1
grand	1
about	1

and	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
ridiculous	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
proud	1
and	1
gay	1
smile	1
under	1
his	1
mustaches	1
that	1
he	1
lowered	1
the	1
opera	1
glass	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
cousin	1
but	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
come	1
to	1

well	1
then	1
sit	1
down	1

down	1
again	1

this	1
is	1
rather	1
indiscreet	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
good	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
awful	1
temptation	1
to	1
tell	1

looking	1
at	1

with	1
his	1

not	1

so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
well	1
listen	1
two	1
festive	1
young	1
men	1
were	1
driving	1
officers	1
of	1
your	1
regiment	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
say	1
they	1
were	1
officers	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
lunching	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
drinking	1
possibly	1
they	1
were	1
driving	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
dinner	1
with	1
a	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
festive	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
they	1
beheld	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
hired	1
sledge	1
she	1
overtakes	1
them	1
looks	1
round	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
fancy	1
anyway	1
nods	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
laughs	1
they	1
of	1
course	1
follow	1
her	1
they	1
gallop	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
to	1
their	1
amazement	1
the	1
fair	1
one	1
alights	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
house	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
the	1
fair	1
one	1
darts	1
upstairs	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
story	1
they	1
get	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
red	1
lips	1
under	1
a	1
short	1
veil	1
and	1
exquisite	1
little	1
feet	1
you	1
describe	1
it	1
with	1
such	1
feeling	1
that	1
i	1
fancy	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
and	1
after	1
what	1
you	1
said	1
just	1
now	1
well	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
their	1
comrade	1
s	1
he	1
was	1
giving	1
a	1
farewell	1
dinner	1
there	1
they	1
certainly	1
did	1
drink	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
much	1
as	1
one	1
always	1
does	1
at	1
farewell	1
dinners	1
and	1
at	1
dinner	1
they	1
inquire	1
who	1
lives	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
no	1
one	1
knows	1
only	1
their	1
host	1

valet	1
in	1

to	1
their	1
inquiry	1
whether	1
any	1
young	1
ladies	1
are	1
living	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
floor	1
answered	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
about	1
there	1
after	1
dinner	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
go	1
into	1
their	1
host	1
s	1
study	1
and	1
write	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
unknown	1
fair	1
one	1
they	1
compose	1
an	1
ardent	1
epistle	1
a	1
declaration	1
in	1
fact	1
and	1
they	1
carry	1
the	1
letter	1
upstairs	1
themselves	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
elucidate	1
whatever	1
might	1
appear	1
not	1
perfectly	1
intelligible	1
in	1
the	1
letter	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
telling	1
me	1
these	1
horrible	1
stories	1
well	1

ring	1
a	1
maid	1

her	1

in	1

that	1
they	1

die	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
maid	1
stupefied	1
carries	1
in	1
their	1
messages	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
gentleman	1
appears	1
with	1
whiskers	1
like	1
sausages	1

red	1
as	1
a	1
lobster	1
announces	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1

that	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
happy	1
couple	1
a	1
government	1
clerk	1
and	1
his	1
lady	1
the	1

ah	1

shall	1
hear	1
we	1
apologize	1
in	1
due	1
form	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
despair	1
we	1
entreat	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
misunderstanding	1
the	1
government	1
clerk	1
with	1
the	1

begins	1
to	1
melt	1
but	1
he	1
too	1
desires	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
sentiments	1

as	1
soon	1
as	1
ever	1
he	1
begins	1
to	1
express	1
them	1
he	1
begins	1
to	1
get	1
hot	1
and	1
say	1
nasty	1
things	1
and	1
again	1
i	1
m	1
obliged	1
to	1
trot	1
out	1
all	1
my	1
diplomatic	1
talents	1
i	1
allowed	1
that	1
their	1
conduct	1
was	1
bad	1
but	1
i	1
urged	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
into	1
consideration	1
their	1
heedlessness	1
their	1
youth	1
then	1
too	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
been	1
lunching	1
together	1
you	1
understand	1
they	1
regret	1
it	1
deeply	1
and	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
overlook	1
their	1
misbehavior	1
the	1
government	1
clerk	1
was	1
softened	1
once	1
more	1
i	1
consent	1
count	1
and	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
overlook	1
it	1
but	1
you	1
perceive	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
my	1
wife	1
s	1
a	1
respectable	1
woman	1
has	1
been	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
persecution	1
and	1
insults	1
and	1
effrontery	1
of	1
young	1
upstarts	1
scoundrels	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
the	1
young	1
upstarts	1
are	1
present	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
and	1
i	1

to	1

with	1

twitched	1
down	1

worked	1
up	1

drove	1
to	1
the	1
french	1

where	1
he	1
really	1
had	1
to	1

never	1
missed	1
a	1

returning	1
from	1
his	1
office	1
heard	1
a	1
ring	1
at	1

went	1
out	1

it	1
s	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
said	1
the	1

invited	1
to	1

t	1
let	1
it	1
drop	1
he	1
ll	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
thing	1
vronsky	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
thanklessness	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
of	1
a	1
duel	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
everything	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
soften	1
the	1
government	1
clerk	1
and	1
hush	1
the	1
matter	1
up	1
the	1
colonel	1
had	1
called	1
in	1
vronsky	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
honorable	1
and	1
intelligent	1
man	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
cared	1
for	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
they	1
talked	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
decided	1
that	1
petritsky	1
and	1
kedrov	1
must	1
go	1
with	1
vronsky	1
to	1
venden	1
s	1
to	1
apologize	1
the	1
colonel	1
and	1
vronsky	1
were	1
both	1
fully	1
aware	1
that	1
vronsky	1
s	1
name	1
and	1
rank	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
contribute	1
greatly	1
to	1
the	1
softening	1
of	1
the	1
injured	1
husband	1
s	1
feelings	1
and	1
these	1
two	1
influences	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
fact	1
without	1
effect	1
though	1
the	1
result	1
remained	1
as	1
vronsky	1
had	1
described	1
uncertain	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
french	1
theater	1
vronsky	1
retired	1
to	1
the	1
foyer	1
with	1
the	1
colonel	1
and	1
reported	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
success	1
or	1
non	1
success	1
the	1
colonel	1
thinking	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
matter	1
further	1
but	1
then	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
satisfaction	1
proceeded	1
to	1
cross	1
examine	1
vronsky	1
about	1
his	1
interview	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
restrain	1
his	1
laughter	1
as	1
vronsky	1
described	1
how	1
the	1
government	1
clerk	1
after	1
subsiding	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
would	1
suddenly	1
flare	1
up	1
again	1
as	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
details	1
and	1
how	1
vronsky	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
half	1

of	1
conciliation	1
skillfully	1
manœuvered	1
a	1
retreat	1

for	1

of	1

with	1
freshly	1

in	1
black	1
velvet	1
with	1
sharply	1
defined	1
black	1
eyebrows	1
in	1
both	1
groups	1
conversation	1
wavered	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
does	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
few	1
minutes	1
broken	1
up	1
by	1
meetings	1
greetings	1
offers	1
of	1
tea	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
feeling	1
about	1
for	1
something	1
to	1
rest	1
upon	1
she	1
s	1
exceptionally	1
good	1
as	1
an	1
actress	1
one	1
can	1
see	1
she	1
s	1
studied	1
kaulbach	1
said	1
a	1
diplomatic	1
attaché	1
in	1
the	1
group	1
round	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
did	1
you	1
notice	1
how	1
she	1
fell	1
down	1
oh	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
nilsson	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
possibly	1
say	1
anything	1
new	1
about	1
her	1
said	1
a	1
fat	1
red	1
faced	1
flaxen	1
headed	1
lady	1
without	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
chignon	1
wearing	1
an	1
old	1
silk	1
dress	1
this	1
was	1
princess	1
myakaya	1
noted	1
for	1
her	1
simplicity	1
and	1
the	1
roughness	1
of	1
her	1
manners	1
and	1
nicknamed	1
enfant	1
terrible	1
princess	1
myakaya	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
groups	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
both	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
first	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
three	1
people	1
have	1
used	1
that	1
very	1
phrase	1
about	1
kaulbach	1
to	1
me	1
today	1
already	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
compact	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
see	1
why	1
they	1
liked	1
that	1
remark	1
so	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
cut	1
short	1
by	1
this	1
observation	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
subject	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
again	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
something	1
amusing	1
but	1
not	1
spiteful	1
said	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
a	1
great	1
proficient	1
in	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
that	1
elegant	1
conversation	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
english	1
small	1
talk	1
she	1
addressed	1
the	1
attaché	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
now	1
what	1
to	1
begin	1
upon	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
difficult	1
task	1
that	1
nothing	1
s	1
amusing	1
that	1
isn	1
t	1
spiteful	1
he	1
began	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
but	1
i	1
ll	1
try	1
get	1
me	1
a	1
subject	1
it	1
all	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
subject	1
if	1
a	1
subject	1
s	1
given	1
me	1
it	1
s	1
easy	1
to	1
spin	1
something	1
round	1
it	1
i	1
often	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
celebrated	1
talkers	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
century	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
talk	1
cleverly	1
now	1
everything	1
clever	1
is	1
so	1
stale	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
long	1
ago	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
interrupted	1
him	1
laughing	1
the	1
conversation	1
began	1
amiably	1
but	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
amiable	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop	1
again	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
sure	1
never	1
failing	1
topic	1
gossip	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
think	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
louis	1
quinze	1
about	1
tushkevitch	1
he	1
said	1
glancing	1
towards	1
a	1
handsome	1
fair	1
haired	1
young	1
man	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
oh	1
yes	1
he	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
as	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
often	1
here	1
this	1
conversation	1
was	1
maintained	1
since	1
it	1
rested	1
on	1
allusions	1
to	1
what	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
talked	1
of	1
in	1
that	1
room	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
relations	1
of	1
tushkevitch	1
with	1
their	1
hostess	1
round	1
the	1
samovar	1
and	1
the	1

inevitable	1
topics	1
the	1
latest	1
piece	1
of	1
public	1
news	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
luckless	1

the	1
sensation	1
produced	1
by	1
princess	1
myakaya	1
s	1
speeches	1
was	1
always	1
unique	1
and	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
sensation	1
she	1
produced	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
spoke	1
not	1
always	1
appropriately	1
as	1
now	1
she	1
said	1
simple	1
things	1
with	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
lived	1
such	1
plain	1
statements	1
produced	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
wittiest	1
epigram	1
princess	1
myakaya	1
could	1
never	1
see	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
that	1
effect	1
but	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
had	1
and	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
everyone	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
while	1
princess	1
myakaya	1
spoke	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
conversation	1
around	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
had	1
dropped	1
princess	1
betsy	1
tried	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
together	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1

the	1

responded	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
begun	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
conversation	1
they	1
were	1
criticizing	1
the	1
karenins	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
anna	1

something	1
strange	1
about	1

punishment	1
for	1
something	1
i	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
punishment	1
but	1
a	1
woman	1
must	1
dislike	1
being	1
without	1
a	1
shadow	1
yes	1

simply	1
a	1
fool	1

it	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
but	1
doesn	1
t	1
it	1
really	1
make	1
everything	1
clear	1
before	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
consider	1
him	1
clever	1
i	1
kept	1
looking	1
for	1
his	1
ability	1
and	1
thought	1
myself	1
a	1
fool	1
for	1
not	1
seeing	1
it	1
but	1
directly	1
i	1
said	1
he	1

a	1
fool	1
	1

of	1

joined	1
the	1
group	1
at	1
the	1

with	1
a	1
smile	1
as	1

sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1

towards	1
the	1

he	1
was	1
meeting	1
here	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
all	1
every	1
day	1

he	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
quiet	1
manner	1
with	1
which	1
one	1
enters	1
a	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
people	1
from	1
whom	1
one	1
has	1
only	1
just	1
parted	1
where	1

in	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
question	1
from	1
the	1
ambassador	1

wife	1
well	1
there	1

seen	1
it	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
and	1
always	1
with	1
fresh	1
enjoyment	1
it	1
s	1
exquisite	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
disgraceful	1
but	1
i	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
at	1
the	1
opera	1
and	1
i	1
sit	1
out	1
the	1
opera	1
bouffe	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
minute	1
and	1
enjoy	1
it	1
this	1
evening	1

mentioned	1
a	1
french	1
actress	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
something	1
about	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
ambassador	1

wife	1
with	1
playful	1
horror	1
cut	1
him	1
short	1
please	1

t	1
tell	1
us	1
about	1
that	1
horror	1
all	1
right	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
especially	1
as	1
everyone	1
knows	1
those	1
horrors	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
all	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
accepted	1
as	1
the	1
correct	1
thing	1
like	1
the	1
opera	1

in	1

chapter	1
7	1
steps	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
princess	1
betsy	1
knowing	1
it	1
was	1
madame	1
karenina	1
glanced	1
at	1
vronsky	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
strange	1
new	1
expression	1
joyfully	1
intently	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
timidly	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
approaching	1
figure	1
and	1
slowly	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
anna	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
holding	1
herself	1
extremely	1
erect	1
as	1
always	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
moving	1
with	1
her	1
swift	1
resolute	1
and	1
light	1
step	1
that	1
distinguished	1
her	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
society	1
women	1
she	1
crossed	1
the	1
short	1
space	1
to	1
her	1
hostess	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
her	1
smiled	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
looked	1
around	1
at	1
vronsky	1
vronsky	1
bowed	1
low	1
and	1
pushed	1
a	1
chair	1
up	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
acknowledged	1
this	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
slight	1
nod	1
flushed	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
frowned	1
but	1
immediately	1
while	1
rapidly	1
greeting	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
shaking	1
the	1
hands	1
proffered	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
addressed	1

told	1
us	1
about	1
the	1
life	1
in	1
india	1
most	1
interesting	1
things	1
the	1
conversation	1
interrupted	1
by	1
her	1
coming	1
in	1
flickered	1
up	1
again	1
like	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
lamp	1
being	1
blown	1
out	1
sir	1
john	1
yes	1
sir	1
john	1

in	1

topov	1
yes	1
they	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
quite	1
a	1
settled	1
thing	1
i	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
parents	1
they	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
marriage	1
for	1
love	1
for	1
love	1
what	1
antediluvian	1
notions	1
you	1
have	1
can	1
one	1
talk	1
of	1
love	1
in	1
these	1
days	1

the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
foolish	1
old	1
fashion	1
that	1
s	1
kept	1
up	1
still	1
said	1
vronsky	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
fashion	1
the	1
only	1
happy	1
marriages	1
i	1
know	1
are	1
marriages	1
of	1
prudence	1
yes	1
but	1
then	1
how	1
often	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
these	1
prudent	1
marriages	1
flies	1
away	1
like	1
dust	1
just	1
because	1
that	1
passion	1
turns	1
up	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
refused	1
to	1
recognize	1
said	1
vronsky	1
but	1
by	1
marriages	1
of	1
prudence	1
we	1
mean	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
both	1
parties	1
have	1
sown	1
their	1
wild	1
oats	1
already	1
that	1
s	1
like	1
scarlatina	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
it	1
and	1
get	1
it	1
over	1
then	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
how	1

with	1
a	1
fainting	1

waiting	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
he	1
sighed	1
as	1
after	1
a	1
danger	1
escaped	1
when	1
she	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
anna	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
to	1

a	1
cup	1
of	1

standing	1
at	1
her	1

while	1

was	1
pouring	1
out	1
the	1
tea	1
vronsky	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
anna	1
what	1

it	1
they	1
write	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
repeated	1
i	1
often	1

no	1
understanding	1
of	1
what	1
s	1
not	1
honorable	1
though	1
they	1
re	1
always	1
talking	1
of	1
it	1
said	1
anna	1
without	1
answering	1
him	1
i	1
ve	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
so	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
added	1
and	1
moving	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
away	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
covered	1
with	1
albums	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
quite	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
your	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
handing	1
her	1
the	1
cup	1
she	1
glanced	1
towards	1
the	1
sofa	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
instantly	1
sat	1
down	1
yes	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
wanting	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
you	1
behaved	1
wrongly	1
very	1
wrongly	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
ve	1
acted	1
wrongly	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
doing	1
so	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
glancing	1
severely	1
at	1
him	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
for	1
he	1
answered	1
boldly	1
and	1
joyfully	1
meeting	1
her	1
glance	1
and	1
not	1
dropping	1
his	1
eyes	1
not	1
he	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
confused	1
that	1
only	1
shows	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
heart	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
heart	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
what	1
you	1
spoke	1
of	1
just	1
now	1
was	1
a	1
mistake	1
and	1
not	1
love	1
remember	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
forbidden	1
you	1
to	1
utter	1
that	1
word	1
that	1
hateful	1
word	1
said	1
anna	1
with	1
a	1
shudder	1
but	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
by	1
that	1
very	1
word	1
forbidden	1
she	1
had	1
shown	1
that	1
she	1
acknowledged	1
certain	1
rights	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
very	1
fact	1
was	1
encouraging	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
love	1
i	1
have	1
long	1
meant	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
this	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
looking	1
resolutely	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
hot	1
all	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
burning	1
flush	1
on	1
her	1
cheeks	1
i	1
ve	1
come	1
on	1
purpose	1
this	1
evening	1
knowing	1
i	1
should	1
meet	1
you	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
end	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
blushed	1
before	1
anyone	1
and	1
you	1
force	1
me	1
to	1
feel	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
something	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
spiritual	1
beauty	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
wish	1
of	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
simply	1
and	1
seriously	1
i	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
moscow	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
kitty	1
s	1
forgiveness	1
she	1
said	1
you	1
don	1
t	1

that	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
saw	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
what	1
she	1
forced	1
herself	1
to	1
say	1
not	1
what	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
if	1
you	1
love	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
she	1
whispered	1
do	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
his	1
face	1
grew	1
radiant	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
all	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
no	1
peace	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
all	1

apart	1

to	1
me	1
and	1

before	1

of	1

for	1
me	1
or	1
for	1
you	1

bliss	1
what	1
bliss	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
murmured	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
but	1
she	1
heard	1
she	1
strained	1
every	1
effort	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
let	1
her	1
eyes	1
rest	1
on	1
him	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
it	1
s	1
come	1
he	1
thought	1
in	1
ecstasy	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
despair	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
end	1
it	1
s	1
come	1
she	1
loves	1
me	1
she	1
owns	1
it	1
then	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
me	1
never	1
say	1
such	1
things	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
friends	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
words	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
spoke	1
quite	1
differently	1
friends	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
yourself	1
whether	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
happiest	1
or	1
the	1
wretchedest	1
of	1
people	1
that	1
s	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
something	1
but	1
he	1
interrupted	1
her	1
i	1
ask	1
one	1
thing	1
only	1
i	1
ask	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
hope	1
to	1
suffer	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
but	1
if	1
even	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1

me	1
to	1
disappear	1
and	1
i	1
disappear	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me	1
if	1
my	1
presence	1
is	1
distasteful	1
to	1
you	1

away	1

he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
shaky	1
voice	1
here	1
s	1
your	1
husband	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
did	1
in	1
fact	1
walk	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
calm	1
awkward	1
gait	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
vronsky	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
began	1
talking	1
in	1
his	1
deliberate	1
always	1
audible	1
voice	1
in	1
his	1
habitual	1
tone	1
of	1
banter	1
ridiculing	1
someone	1
your	1
rambouillet	1
is	1
in	1
full	1
conclave	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
party	1
the	1
graces	1
and	1
the	1
muses	1
but	1
princess	1
betsy	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
sneering	1
as	1
she	1
called	1
it	1
using	1
the	1
english	1
word	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
skillful	1
hostess	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
serious	1
conversation	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
universal	1
conscription	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
immediately	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
began	1
seriously	1
defending	1
the	1
new	1
imperial	1
decree	1
against	1
princess	1
betsy	1
who	1
had	1
attacked	1
it	1
vronsky	1
and	1
anna	1
still	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
this	1
is	1
getting	1
indecorous	1
whispered	1
one	1
lady	1
with	1
an	1
expressive	1
glance	1
at	1
madame	1
karenina	1
vronsky	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
what	1
did	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
said	1
anna	1

friend	1
but	1
not	1
only	1
those	1
ladies	1
almost	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
even	1
the	1
princess	1
myakaya	1
and	1
betsy	1
herself	1
looked	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
who	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
circle	1
as	1
though	1
that	1
were	1
a	1
disturbing	1
fact	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
look	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
diverted	1
from	1
the	1
interesting	1
discussion	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
upon	1
noticing	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
made	1
on	1
everyone	1
princess	1

slipped	1
someone	1
else	1
into	1
her	1
place	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
anna	1
i	1
m	1
always	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
clearness	1
and	1
precision	1
of	1
your	1
husband	1
s	1
language	1
she	1
said	1
the	1
most	1
transcendental	1
ideas	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
within	1
my	1
grasp	1
when	1
he	1
s	1
speaking	1
oh	1
yes	1
said	1
anna	1
radiant	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
not	1
understanding	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
betsy	1
had	1
said	1
she	1
crossed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
table	1
and	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
after	1
staying	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
suggested	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
home	1
together	1
but	1
she	1
answered	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
staying	1
to	1
supper	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
made	1
his	1
bows	1
and	1
withdrew	1

with	1
difficulty	1
holding	1

of	1
grays	1
chilled	1
with	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
rearing	1
at	1

with	1
her	1
quick	1

unfastening	1
the	1
lace	1
of	1
her	1
sleeve	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
hook	1
of	1
her	1
fur	1
cloak	1
and	1
with	1
bent	1
head	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
vronsky	1
murmured	1
as	1
he	1
escorted	1
her	1
down	1
you	1
ve	1
said	1
nothing	1
of	1
course	1
and	1
i	1
ask	1
nothing	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
friendship	1
s	1
not	1
what	1
i	1
want	1
that	1
there	1
s	1
only	1
one	1
happiness	1
in	1

for	1
me	1
that	1
word	1
that	1
you	1
dislike	1
so	1
yes	1
love	1
love	1
she	1
repeated	1
slowly	1
in	1
an	1
inner	1
voice	1
and	1
suddenly	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
she	1
unhooked	1
the	1
lace	1
she	1
added	1
why	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
means	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
me	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
can	1
understand	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
au	1
revoir	1
	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
rapid	1
springy	1
step	1
she	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
porter	1
and	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
her	1
glance	1
the	1
touch	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
set	1
him	1
aflame	1
he	1
kissed	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
touched	1
it	1
and	1
went	1
home	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1

aims	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
seen	1
nothing	1
striking	1
or	1
improper	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
vronsky	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
apart	1
in	1
eager	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
something	1
but	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
this	1
appeared	1
something	1
striking	1
and	1
improper	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
too	1
to	1
be	1
improper	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
on	1
reaching	1
home	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
as	1
he	1
usually	1
did	1
seated	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
low	1
chair	1
opened	1
a	1
book	1
on	1
the	1
papacy	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
the	1
paper	1
knife	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
read	1
till	1
one	1
o	1
clock	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
usually	1
did	1
but	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
rubbed	1
his	1
high	1
forehead	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
drive	1
away	1
something	1
at	1
his	1
usual	1
time	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
toilet	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
went	1
upstairs	1
but	1
this	1
evening	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
thoughts	1
and	1
meditations	1
upon	1
official	1
details	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
absorbed	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
something	1
disagreeable	1
connected	1
with	1
her	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
habit	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
bed	1
but	1
fell	1
to	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
rooms	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
clasped	1
behind	1
his	1
back	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
feeling	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
absolutely	1
needful	1
for	1
him	1
first	1
to	1
think	1
thoroughly	1
over	1
the	1
position	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
arisen	1
when	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
about	1
it	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
a	1
very	1
easy	1
and	1
simple	1
matter	1
but	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
presented	1
itself	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
very	1
complicated	1
and	1
difficult	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
not	1
jealous	1
jealousy	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
notions	1
was	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
one	1
s	1
wife	1
and	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
wife	1
why	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
confidence	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
complete	1
conviction	1
that	1
his	1
young	1
wife	1
would	1
always	1
love	1
him	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
himself	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
experience	1
of	1
lack	1
of	1
confidence	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
confidence	1
in	1
her	1
and	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
now	1
though	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
jealousy	1
was	1
a	1
shameful	1
feeling	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
feel	1
confidence	1
had	1
not	1
broken	1
down	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
something	1
illogical	1
and	1
irrational	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
standing	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
life	1
with	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
loving	1
someone	1
other	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
very	1
irrational	1
and	1
incomprehensible	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
life	1
itself	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
lived	1
and	1
worked	1
in	1
official	1
spheres	1
having	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
reflection	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
stumbled	1
against	1
life	1
itself	1
he	1
had	1
shrunk	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
now	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
while	1
calmly	1
crossing	1
a	1
precipice	1
by	1
a	1
bridge	1
should	1
suddenly	1
discover	1
that	1
the	1
bridge	1
is	1
broken	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
chasm	1
below	1
that	1
chasm	1
was	1
life	1
itself	1
the	1
bridge	1
that	1
artificial	1
life	1
in	1
which	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
lived	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
question	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
loving	1
someone	1
else	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
it	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
undress	1
but	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
regular	1
tread	1
over	1
the	1
resounding	1
parquet	1
of	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
where	1
one	1
lamp	1
was	1
burning	1
over	1
the	1
carpet	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
drawing	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
light	1
was	1
reflected	1
on	1
the	1
big	1
new	1
portrait	1
of	1
himself	1
hanging	1
over	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
across	1
her	1
boudoir	1
where	1
two	1
candles	1
burned	1
lighting	1
up	1
the	1
portraits	1
of	1
her	1
parents	1
and	1
woman	1
friends	1
and	1
the	1
pretty	1
knick	1
knacks	1
of	1
her	1
writing	1
table	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
he	1
walked	1
across	1
her	1
boudoir	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
door	1
and	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
at	1
each	1
turn	1
in	1
his	1
walk	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
parquet	1
of	1
the	1
lighted	1
dining	1
room	1
he	1
halted	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
yes	1
this	1
i	1
must	1
decide	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
i	1
must	1
express	1
my	1
view	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
my	1
decision	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
but	1
express	1
what	1
what	1
decision	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
no	1
reply	1
but	1
after	1
all	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
before	1
turning	1
into	1
the	1
boudoir	1
what	1
has	1
occurred	1
nothing	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
what	1
of	1
that	1
surely	1
women	1
in	1
society	1
can	1
talk	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
please	1
and	1
then	1
jealousy	1
means	1
lowering	1
both	1
myself	1
and	1
her	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
boudoir	1
but	1
this	1
dictum	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
such	1
weight	1
with	1
him	1
before	1
had	1
now	1
no	1
weight	1
and	1
no	1
meaning	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom	1
door	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
dark	1
drawing	1
room	1
some	1
inner	1
voice	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
others	1
noticed	1
it	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
yes	1
i	1
must	1
decide	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
express	1
my	1
view	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
decide	1
how	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
and	1
answered	1
nothing	1
and	1
recollected	1
that	1
jealousy	1
was	1
a	1
feeling	1
insulting	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
but	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
his	1
thoughts	1
like	1
his	1
body	1
went	1
round	1
a	1
complete	1
circle	1
without	1
coming	1
upon	1
anything	1
new	1
he	1
noticed	1
this	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
boudoir	1
there	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
malachite	1
blotting	1
case	1
lying	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
and	1
an	1
unfinished	1
letter	1
his	1
thoughts	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
pictured	1
vividly	1
to	1
himself	1
her	1
personal	1
life	1
her	1
ideas	1
her	1
desires	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
separate	1
life	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
alarming	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
dispel	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
chasm	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
peep	1
into	1
to	1
put	1
himself	1
in	1
thought	1
and	1
feeling	1
in	1
another	1
person	1
s	1
place	1
was	1
a	1
spiritual	1
exercise	1
not	1
natural	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
this	1
spiritual	1
exercise	1
as	1
a	1
harmful	1
and	1
dangerous	1
abuse	1
of	1
the	1
fancy	1
and	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
thought	1
he	1
is	1
that	1
just	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
my	1
great	1
work	1
is	1
approaching	1
completion	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
project	1
he	1
was	1
bringing	1
forward	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
i	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
mental	1
peace	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
energies	1
just	1
now	1
this	1
stupid	1
worry	1
should	1
fall	1
foul	1
of	1
me	1
but	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
submit	1
to	1
uneasiness	1
and	1
worry	1
without	1
having	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
character	1
to	1
face	1
them	1
i	1
must	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
decision	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mind	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
passed	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
passing	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
affair	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
her	1
conscience	1
and	1
falls	1
under	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
religion	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
feeling	1
consolation	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
to	1
which	1
division	1
of	1
regulating	1
principles	1
this	1
new	1
circumstance	1
could	1
be	1
properly	1
referred	1
and	1
so	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
feelings	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
are	1
questions	1
for	1
her	1
conscience	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
can	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
my	1
duty	1
is	1
clearly	1
defined	1
as	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
person	1
bound	1
in	1
duty	1
to	1
guide	1
her	1
and	1
consequently	1
in	1
part	1
the	1
person	1
responsible	1
i	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
danger	1
i	1
perceive	1
to	1
warn	1
her	1
even	1
to	1
use	1
my	1
authority	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
speak	1
plainly	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1

would	1
say	1

his	1
wife	1

clear	1
shape	1
in	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1

thinking	1
over	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
he	1
somewhat	1
regretted	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
time	1
and	1
mental	1
powers	1
for	1
domestic	1
consumption	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
to	1
show	1
for	1
it	1

in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
the	1
form	1
and	1
contents	1
of	1
the	1
speech	1
before	1
him	1
shaped	1
itself	1
as	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
a	1
ministerial	1
report	1
i	1
must	1
say	1
and	1
express	1
fully	1
the	1
following	1
points	1

of	1
the	1
value	1
to	1

the	1
cracking	1
of	1
his	1

soothed	1
him	1
and	1
gave	1
precision	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts	1
so	1
needful	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
juncture	1
there	1
was	1
the	1

of	1

mounting	1

alexey	1

ready	1
for	1

was	1

that	1

was	1
close	1

though	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1

this	1

was	1

it	1
s	1
necessary	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
with	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
wonderingly	1
she	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
dressing	1
room	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
why	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
what	1
about	1
she	1
asked	1
sitting	1
down	1
well	1
let	1
s	1
talk	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
necessary	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
sleep	1
anna	1
said	1
what	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
marveled	1
hearing	1
herself	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
capacity	1
for	1
lying	1
how	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
were	1
her	1
words	1
and	1
how	1
likely	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
simply	1
sleepy	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
clad	1
in	1
an	1
impenetrable	1
armor	1
of	1
falsehood	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
some	1
unseen	1
force	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
aid	1
and	1
was	1
supporting	1
her	1
anna	1
i	1
must	1
warn	1
you	1
he	1
began	1
warn	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
so	1
simply	1
so	1
brightly	1
that	1
anyone	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
knew	1
her	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
noticed	1
anything	1
unnatural	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
or	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
words	1
but	1
to	1
him	1
knowing	1
her	1
knowing	1
that	1
whenever	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
five	1
minutes	1
later	1
than	1
usual	1
she	1
noticed	1
it	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
the	1
reason	1
to	1
him	1
knowing	1
that	1
every	1
joy	1
every	1
pleasure	1
and	1
pain	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
communicated	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
notice	1
his	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
herself	1
meant	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
inmost	1
recesses	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
that	1
had	1
always	1
hitherto	1
lain	1
open	1
before	1
him	1
were	1
closed	1
against	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
from	1
her	1
tone	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
perturbed	1
at	1
that	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
said	1
straight	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
shut	1
up	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
future	1
now	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
returning	1
home	1
and	1
finding	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
locked	1
up	1
but	1
perhaps	1
the	1
key	1
may	1
yet	1
be	1
found	1
thought	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
warn	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
that	1
through	1
thoughtlessness	1
and	1
lack	1
of	1
caution	1
you	1
may	1
cause	1
yourself	1
to	1
be	1
talked	1
about	1
in	1
society	1
your	1
too	1
animated	1
conversation	1
this	1
evening	1
with	1
count	1
vronsky	1
he	1
enunciated	1
the	1
name	1
firmly	1
and	1
with	1
deliberate	1
emphasis	1
attracted	1
attention	1
he	1
talked	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
laughing	1
eyes	1
which	1
frightened	1
him	1
now	1
with	1
their	1
impenetrable	1
look	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
he	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
uselessness	1
and	1
idleness	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
you	1
re	1
always	1
like	1
that	1
she	1
answered	1
as	1
though	1
completely	1
misapprehending	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
only	1
taking	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
phrase	1
one	1
time	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
my	1
being	1
dull	1
and	1
another	1
time	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
my	1
being	1
lively	1
i	1
wasn	1
t	1
dull	1
does	1
that	1
offend	1
you	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
shivered	1
and	1
bent	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
joints	1
crack	1
oh	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
do	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
so	1
dislike	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
anna	1
is	1
this	1
you	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
quietly	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
over	1
himself	1
and	1
restraining	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
about	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
such	1
genuine	1
and	1
droll	1
wonder	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
me	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
paused	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
doing	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
intended	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
warning	1
his	1
wife	1
against	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
become	1
agitated	1
over	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
her	1
conscience	1
and	1
was	1
struggling	1
against	1
the	1
barrier	1
he	1
fancied	1
between	1
them	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
i	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
coldly	1
and	1
composedly	1
and	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
it	1
i	1
consider	1
jealousy	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
a	1
humiliating	1
and	1
degrading	1
feeling	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
allow	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
influenced	1
by	1
it	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
rules	1
of	1
decorum	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
disregarded	1
with	1
impunity	1
this	1
evening	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
i	1
observed	1
it	1
but	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
impression	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
company	1
everyone	1
observed	1
that	1
your	1
conduct	1
and	1
deportment	1
were	1
not	1
altogether	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
desired	1
i	1
positively	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
said	1
anna	1
shrugging	1
her	1
shoulders	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
care	1
she	1
thought	1
but	1
other	1
people	1
noticed	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
upsets	1
him	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
well	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
she	1
added	1
and	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
he	1
moved	1
forward	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
stop	1
her	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
ugly	1
and	1
forbidding	1
as	1
anna	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
him	1
she	1
stopped	1
and	1
bending	1
her	1
head	1
back	1
and	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
began	1
with	1
her	1
rapid	1
hand	1
taking	1
out	1
her	1
hairpins	1
well	1
i	1
m	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
come	1
she	1
said	1
calmly	1
and	1
ironically	1
and	1
indeed	1
i	1
listen	1
with	1
interest	1
for	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
she	1
spoke	1
and	1
marveled	1
at	1
the	1
confident	1
calm	1
and	1
natural	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
and	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
your	1
feelings	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
and	1
besides	1
i	1
regard	1
that	1
as	1
useless	1
and	1
even	1
harmful	1
began	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
ferreting	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
soul	1
one	1
often	1
ferrets	1
out	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
lain	1
there	1
unnoticed	1
your	1
feelings	1
are	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
conscience	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
duty	1
bound	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
to	1
god	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
you	1
your	1
duties	1
our	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
joined	1
not	1
by	1
man	1
but	1
by	1
god	1
that	1
union	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
severed	1
by	1
a	1
crime	1
and	1
a	1
crime	1
of	1
that	1
nature	1
brings	1
its	1
own	1
chastisement	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
oh	1
dear	1
how	1
sleepy	1
i	1
am	1
unluckily	1
she	1
said	1
rapidly	1
passing	1
her	1
hand	1
through	1
her	1
hair	1
feeling	1
for	1
the	1
remaining	1
hairpins	1
anna	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
don	1
t	1
speak	1
like	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
gently	1
perhaps	1
i	1
am	1
mistaken	1
but	1
believe	1
me	1
what	1
i	1
say	1
i	1
say	1
as	1
much	1
for	1
myself	1
as	1
for	1
you	1
i	1
am	1
your	1
husband	1
and	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
her	1
face	1
fell	1
and	1
the	1
mocking	1
gleam	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
died	1
away	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
love	1
threw	1
her	1
into	1
revolt	1
again	1
she	1
thought	1
love	1
can	1
he	1
love	1
if	1
he	1
hadn	1
t	1
heard	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
love	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
word	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
love	1
is	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
really	1
i	1
don	1
t	1

she	1
said	1
define	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
find	1
pardon	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
all	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
myself	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
persons	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
are	1
our	1
son	1
and	1
yourself	1
it	1
may	1
very	1
well	1
be	1
i	1
repeat	1
that	1
my	1
words	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
utterly	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
called	1
forth	1
by	1
my	1
mistaken	1
impression	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
conscious	1
yourself	1
of	1
even	1
the	1
smallest	1
foundation	1
for	1
them	1
then	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
think	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
if	1
your	1
heart	1
prompts	1
you	1
to	1
speak	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
unconsciously	1
saying	1
something	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
besides	1
she	1
said	1
hurriedly	1
with	1
difficulty	1
repressing	1
a	1
smile	1
it	1
s	1
really	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
bed	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
sighed	1
and	1
without	1
saying	1
more	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
bed	1
his	1
lips	1
were	1
sternly	1
compressed	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
looked	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
anna	1
got	1
into	1
her	1
bed	1
and	1
lay	1
expecting	1
every	1
minute	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
again	1
she	1
both	1
feared	1
his	1
speaking	1
and	1
wished	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
she	1
waited	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
without	1
moving	1
and	1
had	1
forgotten	1
about	1
him	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
other	1
she	1
pictured	1
him	1
and	1
felt	1
how	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
flooded	1
with	1
emotion	1
and	1
guilty	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
suddenly	1
she	1
heard	1
an	1
even	1
tranquil	1
snore	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
seemed	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
appalled	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
snoring	1
and	1
ceased	1
but	1
after	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
two	1
breathings	1
the	1
snore	1
sounded	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
tranquil	1
rhythm	1
it	1
s	1
late	1
it	1
s	1
late	1
she	1
whispered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
lay	1
not	1
moving	1
with	1
open	1
eyes	1
whose	1
brilliance	1
she	1
almost	1
fancied	1
she	1
could	1
herself	1

in	1
the	1
darkness	1
chapter	1
10	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
a	1
new	1
life	1
began	1
for	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
nothing	1
special	1
happened	1
anna	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
society	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
done	1
was	1
particularly	1
often	1
at	1
princess	1
betsy	1
s	1
and	1
met	1
vronsky	1
everywhere	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
this	1
but	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
all	1
his	1
efforts	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
into	1
open	1
discussion	1
she	1
confronted	1
with	1
a	1
barrier	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
penetrate	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
amused	1
perplexity	1
outwardly	1
everything	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
but	1
their	1
inner	1
relations	1
were	1
completely	1
changed	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
politics	1
felt	1
himself	1
helpless	1
in	1
this	1
like	1
an	1
ox	1
with	1
head	1
bent	1
submissively	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
blow	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
was	1
lifted	1
over	1
him	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
try	1
once	1
more	1
that	1
by	1
kindness	1
tenderness	1
and	1
persuasion	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
hope	1
of	1
saving	1
her	1
of	1
bringing	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
made	1
ready	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
evil	1
and	1
deceit	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
had	1
possession	1
of	1
him	1
too	1
and	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
quite	1
unlike	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
talk	1
involuntarily	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
habitual	1
tone	1
of	1
jeering	1
at	1
anyone	1
who	1
should	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
tone	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1

almost	1
a	1
whole	1

the	1
one	1
absorbing	1

his	1

besought	1
her	1

said	1
sobbing	1
pressing	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
her	1
bosom	1
she	1
felt	1
so	1
sinful	1
so	1
guilty	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
left	1
her	1

to	1
humiliate	1

he	1
felt	1
what	1
a	1

must	1
feel	1
when	1

he	1
has	1
robbed	1

him	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
their	1
love	1
the	1
first	1
stage	1
of	1
their	1
love	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
awful	1
and	1
revolting	1
in	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
bought	1
at	1
this	1
fearful	1
price	1
of	1
shame	1
shame	1
at	1
their	1
spiritual	1
nakedness	1
crushed	1
her	1
and	1
infected	1
him	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
murderer	1
s	1
horror	1
before	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
victim	1
he	1
must	1

to	1

the	1

must	1
use	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
gained	1
by	1
his	1
murder	1
and	1
with	1
fury	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
passion	1
the	1
murderer	1
falls	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
drags	1
it	1
and	1
hacks	1
at	1
it	1
so	1
he	1
covered	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
shoulders	1
with	1
kisses	1
she	1
held	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
stir	1
yes	1
these	1
kisses	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
bought	1
by	1
this	1
shame	1
yes	1
and	1
one	1
hand	1
which	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
mine	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
accomplice	1
she	1
lifted	1
up	1
that	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
he	1
sank	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
face	1
but	1
she	1
hid	1
it	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
at	1
last	1
as	1
though	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
over	1
herself	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
still	1
as	1
beautiful	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
more	1
pitiful	1
for	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
she	1
said	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
never	1
forget	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
whole	1
life	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
of	1
this	1
happiness	1
happiness	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
loathing	1
and	1
her	1
horror	1
unconsciously	1
infected	1
him	1
for	1
pity	1
s	1
sake	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
more	1
she	1
rose	1
quickly	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
more	1
she	1
repeated	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
chill	1
despair	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
parted	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
put	1
into	1
words	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
of	1
rapture	1
and	1
of	1
horror	1
at	1
this	1
stepping	1
into	1
a	1
new	1
life	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
vulgarize	1
this	1
feeling	1
by	1
inappropriate	1
words	1
but	1
later	1
too	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
she	1
still	1
found	1
no	1
words	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
express	1
the	1
complexity	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
indeed	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
find	1
thoughts	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
clearly	1
think	1
out	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
no	1
just	1
now	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
later	1
on	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
calmer	1
but	1
this	1
calm	1
for	1
thought	1
never	1
came	1
every	1
time	1
the	1
thought	1
rose	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
horror	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
drove	1
those	1
thoughts	1
away	1
later	1
later	1
she	1
said	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
calmer	1
but	1
in	1
dreams	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
control	1
over	1
her	1
thoughts	1
her	1
position	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
hideous	1
nakedness	1
one	1
dream	1
haunted	1
her	1
almost	1
every	1
night	1
she	1
dreamed	1
that	1
both	1
were	1
her	1
husbands	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
both	1
were	1
lavishing	1
caresses	1
on	1
her	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
weeping	1
kissing	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
saying	1
how	1
happy	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
and	1
alexey	1
vronsky	1
was	1
there	1
too	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
marveling	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
once	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
explaining	1
to	1
them	1
laughing	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
simpler	1
and	1
that	1
now	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
happy	1
and	1
contented	1
but	1
this	1
dream	1
weighed	1
on	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
nightmare	1
and	1
she	1
awoke	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
terror	1
chapter	1
12	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
moscow	1
whenever	1
levin	1
shuddered	1
and	1
grew	1
red	1
remembering	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
his	1
rejection	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
this	1
was	1
just	1
how	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
shudder	1
and	1
blush	1
thinking	1
myself	1
utterly	1
lost	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
plucked	1
in	1
physics	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
my	1
remove	1
and	1
how	1
i	1
thought	1
myself	1
utterly	1
ruined	1
after	1
i	1
had	1
mismanaged	1
that	1
affair	1
of	1
my	1
sister	1
s	1
that	1
was	1
entrusted	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
yet	1
now	1
that	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
i	1
recall	1
it	1
and	1
wonder	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
distress	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
too	1
with	1
this	1
trouble	1
time	1
will	1
go	1
by	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
mind	1
about	1
this	1
either	1
but	1
three	1
months	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
left	1
off	1
minding	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
painful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
those	1
first	1
days	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
because	1
after	1
dreaming	1
so	1
long	1
of	1
family	1
life	1
and	1
feeling	1
himself	1
so	1
ripe	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
not	1
married	1
and	1
was	1
further	1
than	1
ever	1
from	1
marriage	1
he	1
was	1
painfully	1
conscious	1
himself	1
as	1
were	1
all	1
about	1
him	1
that	1
at	1
his	1
years	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
well	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
before	1
starting	1
for	1
moscow	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
cowman	1
nikolay	1
a	1
simple	1
hearted	1
peasant	1
whom	1
he	1
liked	1
talking	1
to	1
well	1
nikolay	1
i	1
mean	1
to	1
get	1
married	1
and	1
how	1
nikolay	1
had	1
promptly	1
answered	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
matter	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
possible	1
doubt	1
and	1
high	1
time	1
too	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
but	1
marriage	1
had	1
now	1
become	1
further	1
off	1
than	1
ever	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
taken	1
and	1
whenever	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
girls	1
he	1
knew	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
moreover	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
rejection	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
played	1
in	1
the	1
affair	1
tortured	1
him	1
with	1
shame	1
however	1
often	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
recollection	1
like	1
other	1
humiliating	1
reminiscences	1
of	1
a	1
similar	1
kind	1
made	1
him	1
twinge	1
and	1
blush	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
past	1
as	1
in	1
every	1
man	1
s	1
actions	1
recognized	1
by	1
him	1
as	1
bad	1
for	1
which	1
his	1
conscience	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
tormented	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
these	1
evil	1
actions	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
causing	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
suffering	1
as	1
those	1
trivial	1
but	1
humiliating	1
reminiscences	1
these	1
wounds	1
never	1
healed	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
memories	1
was	1
now	1
ranged	1
his	1
rejection	1
and	1
the	1
pitiful	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
appeared	1
to	1
others	1
that	1
evening	1
but	1
time	1
and	1
work	1
did	1
their	1
part	1
bitter	1
memories	1
were	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
covered	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
incidents	1
paltry	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
but	1
really	1
important	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
life	1
every	1
week	1
he	1
thought	1
less	1
often	1
of	1
kitty	1
he	1
was	1
impatiently	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
married	1
or	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
hoping	1
that	1
such	1
news	1
would	1
like	1
having	1
a	1
tooth	1
out	1
completely	1
cure	1
him	1
meanwhile	1
spring	1
came	1
on	1
beautiful	1
and	1
kindly	1
without	1
the	1
delays	1
and	1
treacheries	1
of	1
spring	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
springs	1
in	1
which	1
plants	1
beasts	1
and	1
man	1
rejoice	1
alike	1
this	1
lovely	1
spring	1
roused	1
levin	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
strengthened	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
resolution	1
of	1
renouncing	1
all	1
his	1
past	1
and	1
building	1
up	1
his	1
lonely	1
life	1
firmly	1
and	1
independently	1
though	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
plans	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
carried	1
out	1
still	1
his	1
most	1
important	1
resolution	1
that	1
of	1
purity	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
by	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
free	1
from	1
that	1
shame	1
which	1
had	1
usually	1
harassed	1
him	1
after	1
a	1
fall	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
look	1
everyone	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
in	1
february	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
s	1
health	1
was	1
getting	1
worse	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
advice	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
letter	1
levin	1
went	1
to	1
moscow	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
and	1
succeeded	1
in	1
persuading	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
doctor	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
watering	1
place	1
abroad	1
he	1
succeeded	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
persuading	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
in	1
lending	1
him	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
without	1
irritating	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
himself	1
in	1
that	1
matter	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
his	1
farming	1
which	1
called	1
for	1
special	1
attention	1
in	1
spring	1
and	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
reading	1
levin	1
had	1
begun	1
that	1
winter	1
a	1
work	1
on	1
agriculture	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
which	1
turned	1
on	1
taking	1
into	1
account	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
laborer	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
unalterable	1
data	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
like	1
the	1
climate	1
and	1
the	1
soil	1
and	1
consequently	1
deducing	1
all	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
scientific	1
culture	1
not	1
simply	1
from	1
the	1
data	1
of	1
soil	1
and	1
climate	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
data	1
of	1
soil	1
climate	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
unalterable	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
laborer	1
thus	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
solitude	1
or	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
his	1
solitude	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
full	1
only	1
rarely	1
he	1
suffered	1
from	1
an	1
unsatisfied	1

communicate	1
his	1
stray	1
ideas	1
to	1
someone	1
besides	1
agafea	1

a	1

brooded	1
over	1

that	1

levin	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
big	1
boots	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
a	1
cloth	1
jacket	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
fur	1
cloak	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
his	1
farm	1
stepping	1
over	1
streams	1
of	1
water	1
that	1
flashed	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
dazzled	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
treading	1
one	1
minute	1
on	1

and	1
the	1
next	1
into	1
sticky	1
mud	1
spring	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
plans	1
and	1
projects	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
farmyard	1
levin	1
like	1
a	1
tree	1
in	1
spring	1
that	1
knows	1
not	1
what	1
form	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
shoots	1
and	1
twigs	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
its	1
swelling	1
buds	1
hardly	1
knew	1
what	1
undertakings	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
begin	1
upon	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
farm	1
work	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
splendid	1
plans	1
and	1
projects	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
cattle	1
the	1
cows	1
had	1
been	1
let	1
out	1
into	1
their	1
paddock	1
and	1
their	1
smooth	1
sides	1
were	1
already	1
shining	1
with	1
their	1
new	1
sleek	1
spring	1
coats	1
they	1
basked	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
lowed	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
meadow	1
levin	1
gazed	1
admiringly	1
at	1
the	1
cows	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
intimately	1
to	1
the	1
minutest	1
detail	1
of	1
their	1
condition	1
and	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
meadow	1
and	1
the	1
calves	1
to	1
be	1
let	1
into	1

picking	1
up	1
their	1

splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud	1
with	1
bare	1
legs	1
still	1
white	1
not	1
yet	1
brown	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
waving	1
brush	1
wood	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
chasing	1
the	1
calves	1
that	1
frolicked	1
in	1
the	1
mirth	1
of	1
spring	1
after	1
admiring	1
the	1
young	1
ones	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
who	1
were	1
particularly	1
fine	1
the	1
early	1
calves	1
were	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
peasant	1

daughter	1
at	1
three	1
months	1

as	1
big	1
as	1
a	1

orders	1
for	1
a	1
trough	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
out	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
fed	1
in	1
the	1
paddock	1
but	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
paddock	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
used	1
during	1
the	1
winter	1
the	1
hurdles	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
broken	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
carpenter	1
who	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
orders	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
work	1
at	1
the	1
thrashing	1
machine	1
but	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
the	1
carpenter	1
was	1
repairing	1
the	1
harrows	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
repaired	1
before	1
lent	1
this	1
was	1
very	1
annoying	1
to	1
levin	1
it	1
was	1
annoying	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
that	1
everlasting	1
slovenliness	1
in	1
the	1
farm	1
work	1
against	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
striving	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
the	1
hurdles	1
as	1
he	1
ascertained	1
being	1
not	1
wanted	1
in	1
winter	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
cart	1
horses	1
stable	1
and	1
there	1
broken	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
light	1
construction	1
only	1
meant	1
for	1
feeding	1
calves	1
moreover	1
it	1
was	1
apparent	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
harrows	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
agricultural	1
implements	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
directed	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
over	1
and	1
repaired	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
for	1
which	1
very	1
purpose	1
he	1
had	1
hired	1
three	1
carpenters	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
put	1
into	1
repair	1
and	1
the	1
harrows	1
were	1
being	1
repaired	1
when	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
harrowing	1
the	1
field	1
levin	1
sent	1
for	1
his	1
bailiff	1
but	1
immediately	1
went	1
off	1
himself	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
bailiff	1
beaming	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
everyone	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
sheepskin	1
bordered	1
with	1
astrachan	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
barn	1
twisting	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
straw	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
why	1
isn	1
t	1
the	1
carpenter	1
at	1
the	1
thrashing	1
machine	1
oh	1
i	1
meant	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
yesterday	1
the	1
harrows	1
want	1
repairing	1
here	1
it	1
s	1
time	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
but	1
what	1
were	1
they	1
doing	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
then	1
but	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
want	1
the	1
carpenter	1
for	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
hurdles	1
for	1
the	1
calves	1
paddock	1
i	1
ordered	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
ready	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
with	1
those	1
peasants	1
said	1
the	1
bailiff	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
those	1
peasants	1
but	1
this	1
bailiff	1
said	1
levin	1
getting	1
angry	1
why	1
what	1
do	1
i	1
keep	1
you	1
for	1
he	1
cried	1
but	1
bethinking	1
himself	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
help	1
matters	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
sentence	1
and	1
merely	1
sighed	1
well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
can	1
sowing	1
begin	1
he	1
asked	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
behind	1
turkin	1
tomorrow	1
or	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
they	1
might	1
begin	1
and	1
the	1
clover	1
i	1
ve	1
sent	1
vassily	1
and	1
mishka	1
they	1
re	1
sowing	1
only	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
if	1
they	1
ll	1
manage	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
slushy	1
how	1
many	1
acres	1
about	1
fifteen	1
why	1
not	1
sow	1
all	1
cried	1
levin	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
sowing	1
the	1
clover	1
on	1
fifteen	1
acres	1
not	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
forty	1
five	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
annoying	1
to	1
him	1
clover	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
both	1
from	1
books	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
experience	1
never	1
did	1
well	1
except	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
sown	1
as	1
early	1
as	1
possible	1
almost	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
yet	1
levin	1
could	1
never	1
get	1
this	1
done	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
send	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
peasants	1
three	1
haven	1
t	1
turned	1
up	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
semyon	1
well	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
taken	1
some	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
thatching	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
have	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
peasants	1
then	1
five	1
are	1
making	1
compôte	1
which	1
meant	1
compost	1
four	1
are	1
shifting	1
the	1
oats	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
mildew	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
levin	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
mildew	1
meant	1
that	1
his	1
english	1
seed	1
oats	1
were	1
already	1
ruined	1
again	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
ordered	1
why	1
but	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
during	1
lent	1
to	1
put	1
in	1
pipes	1
he	1
cried	1
don	1
t	1
put	1
yourself	1
out	1
we	1
shall	1
get	1
it	1
all	1
done	1
in	1
time	1
levin	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
angrily	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
granary	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
oats	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
stable	1
the	1
oats	1
were	1
not	1
yet	1
spoiled	1
but	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
carrying	1
the	1
oats	1
in	1
spades	1
when	1
they	1
might	1
simply	1
let	1
them	1
slide	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
lower	1
granary	1
and	1
arranging	1
for	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
taking	1
two	1
workmen	1
from	1
there	1
for	1
sowing	1
clover	1
levin	1
got	1
over	1
his	1
vexation	1
with	1
the	1
bailiff	1
indeed	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
lovely	1
day	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
ignat	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
coachman	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
sleeves	1
tucked	1
up	1
was	1
washing	1
the	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
saddle	1
me	1
which	1
sir	1
well	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
kolpik	1
yes	1
sir	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
saddling	1
his	1
horse	1
levin	1
again	1
called	1
up	1
the	1
bailiff	1
who	1
was	1
hanging	1
about	1
in	1
sight	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
spring	1
operations	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
his	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
farm	1
the	1
wagons	1
were	1
to	1
begin	1
carting	1
manure	1
earlier	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
all	1
done	1
before	1
the	1
early	1
mowing	1
and	1
the	1
ploughing	1
of	1
the	1
further	1
land	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
without	1
a	1
break	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
ripen	1
lying	1
fallow	1
and	1
the	1
mowing	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
done	1
by	1
hired	1
labor	1
not	1
on	1
half	1
profits	1
the	1
bailiff	1
listened	1
attentively	1
and	1
obviously	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
approve	1
of	1
his	1
employer	1
s	1
projects	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
look	1
levin	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
always	1
irritated	1
him	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
hopelessness	1
and	1
despondency	1
that	1
look	1
said	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
as	1
god	1
wills	1
nothing	1
mortified	1
levin	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
tone	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
tone	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
bailiffs	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
had	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
taken	1
up	1
that	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
plans	1
and	1
so	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
angered	1
by	1
it	1
but	1
mortified	1
and	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
roused	1
to	1
struggle	1
against	1
this	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
elemental	1
force	1
continually	1
ranged	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
other	1
expression	1
than	1
as	1
god	1
wills	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
manage	1
it	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
said	1
the	1
bailiff	1
why	1
ever	1
shouldn	1
t	1
you	1
manage	1
it	1
we	1
positively	1
must	1
have	1
another	1
fifteen	1
laborers	1
and	1
they	1
don	1

left	1
in	1

covered	1
with	1

over	1

on	1

to	1
his	1

better	1
than	1

to	1
plant	1
all	1
his	1
fields	1
with	1

along	1
the	1
southern	1
borders	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
snow	1
should	1
not	1
lie	1
under	1
them	1
to	1
divide	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
six	1
fields	1
of	1
arable	1
and	1
three	1
of	1
pasture	1
and	1
hay	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
cattle	1
yard	1
at	1
the	1
further	1
end	1
of	1
the	1

to	1
dig	1
a	1

to	1
construct	1
movable	1

for	1
the	1

as	1
a	1

absorbed	1
in	1

carefully	1
keeping	1
his	1
horse	1
by	1
the	1
hedges	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
trample	1
his	1
young	1

rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

been	1
sent	1
to	1
sow	1
clover	1
a	1
cart	1
with	1

standing	1
not	1
at	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
crop	1
and	1
the	1

had	1
been	1
torn	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
trampled	1
by	1
the	1
horse	1
both	1
the	1
laborers	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
hedge	1
probably	1
smoking	1
a	1
pipe	1
together	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
cart	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
seed	1
was	1
mixed	1
was	1
not	1
crushed	1
to	1

crusted	1
together	1
or	1
adhering	1
in	1
clods	1
seeing	1
the	1

the	1

vassily	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
cart	1
while	1
mishka	1
set	1
to	1

sowing	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be	1

with	1
the	1
laborers	1
levin	1
seldom	1
lost	1
his	1
temper	1
when	1
vassily	1
came	1
up	1
levin	1
told	1
him	1
to	1

up	1

vassily	1
taking	1
up	1
some	1
seed	1
and	1
rolling	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
his	1
palms	1
vassily	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
their	1
having	1
filled	1
up	1
his	1
cart	1
with	1
unsifted	1
earth	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
annoying	1
levin	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
already	1
tried	1
a	1
way	1
he	1
knew	1
for	1
stifling	1
his	1
anger	1
and	1
turning	1
all	1
that	1
seemed	1
dark	1
right	1
again	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
that	1
way	1
now	1
he	1
watched	1
how	1
mishka	1
strode	1
along	1
swinging	1
the	1
huge	1
clods	1
of	1
earth	1
that	1
clung	1
to	1
each	1
foot	1
and	1
getting	1
off	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
sieve	1
from	1
vassily	1
and	1
started	1
sowing	1
himself	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
stop	1
vassily	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
mark	1
with	1
his	1
foot	1
and	1
levin	1
went	1
forward	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
scattering	1
the	1
seed	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
walking	1
was	1
as	1
difficult	1
as	1
on	1

by	1

ended	1
the	1

was	1
in	1
a	1

the	1

the	1

coming	1
up	1
in	1

had	1
survived	1
everything	1

stood	1
up	1

green	1
through	1
the	1
broken	1

of	1

the	1

sank	1
in	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

he	1
drew	1
each	1
hoof	1
with	1
a	1
sucking	1
sound	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
thawed	1
ground	1
over	1
the	1
ploughland	1

only	1
keep	1
a	1
foothold	1
where	1
there	1
was	1

in	1
the	1

furrows	1
he	1
sank	1
deep	1
in	1
at	1

the	1

in	1
splendid	1
condition	1

back	1
across	1
the	1

would	1
have	1

down	1

across	1

startled	1
two	1
ducks	1
there	1

just	1
as	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
turning	1
homewards	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
forest	1

who	1
confirmed	1
his	1
theory	1
about	1
the	1

went	1
home	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
eat	1
his	1
dinner	1

get	1
his	1
gun	1
ready	1
for	1

as	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
levin	1
heard	1
the	1
bell	1
ring	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
someone	1
from	1
the	1
railway	1

he	1
thought	1
just	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
here	1
from	1
the	1
moscow	1
train	1
who	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
what	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
he	1
did	1
say	1
maybe	1
i	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
waters	1
or	1
maybe	1
i	1
ll	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
felt	1
dismayed	1
and	1
vexed	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
s	1
presence	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
disturb	1
his	1
happy	1
mood	1
of	1
spring	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
opened	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
softened	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
expectation	1
now	1
he	1
hoped	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
pricked	1
up	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
riding	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
acacias	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
hired	1
three	1
horse	1

from	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
and	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
a	1
fur	1

it	1
was	1
not	1
his	1

oh	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
some	1
nice	1
person	1
one	1
could	1
talk	1

joyfully	1

up	1
both	1

on	1
that	1
delicious	1
spring	1
day	1
he	1
felt	1

well	1

said	1
levin	1
with	1
a	1
genuine	1
smile	1
of	1
childlike	1
delight	1
levin	1
led	1
his	1
friend	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
set	1
apart	1
for	1
visitors	1
where	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
things	1
were	1

also	1
a	1
bag	1
a	1
gun	1
in	1
a	1

for	1
cigars	1
leaving	1
him	1
there	1
to	1
wash	1
and	1
change	1
his	1
clothes	1
levin	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
the	1
ploughing	1
and	1
clover	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
always	1
very	1
anxious	1
for	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
inquiries	1
about	1
dinner	1
do	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
only	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bailiff	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
washed	1
and	1
combed	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
smile	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
upstairs	1
together	1
well	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
i	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
to	1
you	1
now	1
i	1
shall	1
understand	1
what	1
the	1
mysterious	1
business	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
absorbed	1
in	1
here	1
no	1
really	1
i	1
envy	1
you	1
what	1
a	1
house	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
so	1
bright	1
so	1
cheerful	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
forgetting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
spring	1
and	1
fine	1
weather	1
like	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
your	1
nurse	1
is	1
simply	1
charming	1
a	1
pretty	1
maid	1
in	1
an	1
apron	1
might	1
be	1
even	1
more	1
agreeable	1
perhaps	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
severe	1
monastic	1
style	1
it	1
does	1
very	1
well	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
told	1
him	1
many	1
interesting	1
pieces	1
of	1
news	1
especially	1
interesting	1
to	1
levin	1
was	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
intending	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
a	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
not	1
one	1
word	1
did	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
say	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
kitty	1
and	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
he	1
merely	1
gave	1
him	1
greetings	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
levin	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
delicacy	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
his	1
visitor	1
as	1
always	1
happened	1
with	1
him	1
during	1
his	1
solitude	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
ideas	1
and	1
feelings	1
had	1
been	1
accumulating	1
within	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
communicate	1
to	1
those	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
his	1
poetic	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
and	1
his	1
failures	1
and	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
and	1
criticisms	1
on	1
the	1
books	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
reading	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
book	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
which	1
really	1
was	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
unaware	1
of	1
it	1
himself	1
a	1
criticism	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
books	1
on	1
agriculture	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
always	1
charming	1
understanding	1
everything	1
at	1
the	1
slightest	1
reference	1
was	1
particularly	1
charming	1
on	1
this	1
visit	1
and	1
levin	1
noticed	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
special	1
tenderness	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
tone	1
of	1
respect	1
that	1
flattered	1
him	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
and	1
the	1
cook	1
that	1
the	1
dinner	1
should	1
be	1
particularly	1
good	1
only	1
ended	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
famished	1
friends	1
attacking	1
the	1
preliminary	1
course	1
eating	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
butter	1
salt	1
goose	1
and	1
salted	1
mushrooms	1
and	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
finally	1
ordering	1
the	1
soup	1
to	1
be	1
served	1
without	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
little	1
pies	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
cook	1
had	1
particularly	1
meant	1
to	1
impress	1
their	1
visitor	1
but	1
though	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
very	1
different	1
dinners	1
he	1
thought	1
everything	1
excellent	1
the	1
herb	1
brandy	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
the	1
butter	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
salt	1
goose	1
and	1
the	1
mushrooms	1
and	1
the	1
nettle	1
soup	1
and	1
the	1
chicken	1
in	1
white	1
sauce	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
crimean	1
wine	1
everything	1
was	1
superb	1
and	1
delicious	1
splendid	1
splendid	1
he	1
said	1
lighting	1
a	1
fat	1
cigar	1
after	1
the	1
roast	1
i	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
coming	1
to	1
you	1
i	1
had	1
landed	1
on	1
a	1
peaceful	1
shore	1
after	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
jolting	1
of	1
a	1
steamer	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
maintain	1
that	1
the	1
laborer	1
himself	1
is	1
an	1
element	1
to	1
be	1
studied	1
and	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
methods	1
in	1
agriculture	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
m	1
an	1
ignorant	1
outsider	1
but	1
i	1
should	1
fancy	1
theory	1
and	1
its	1
application	1
will	1
have	1
its	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
laborer	1
too	1
yes	1
but	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
talking	1
of	1
political	1
economy	1
i	1
m	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
agriculture	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
natural	1
sciences	1
and	1
to	1
observe	1
given	1
phenomena	1
and	1
the	1
laborer	1
in	1
his	1
economic	1
ethnographical	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
jam	1
oh	1

at	1

said	1
nothing	1
levin	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
oblonsky	1
for	1
noticing	1
with	1
his	1
never	1

tact	1
that	1
he	1
dreaded	1
conversation	1
about	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1

so	1
saying	1
nothing	1
about	1
them	1
but	1
now	1
levin	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
tormenting	1
him	1
so	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1

me	1
how	1
things	1
are	1
going	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
levin	1
bethinking	1
himself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1

of	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
only	1
of	1

the	1

flash	1
of	1

that	1
cry	1
asked	1

a	1

whistle	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1

in	1
the	1
exact	1
time	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
the	1

could	1
be	1

levin	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
to	1

there	1
just	1

him	1
against	1

above	1
the	1
confused	1
mass	1
of	1

saw	1
the	1
flying	1
bird	1
it	1
was	1
flying	1
straight	1
towards	1
him	1
the	1
guttural	1
cry	1
like	1
the	1
even	1
tearing	1
of	1
some	1
strong	1
stuff	1
sounded	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
ear	1
the	1
long	1
beak	1
and	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
bird	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
when	1
levin	1
was	1
taking	1
aim	1
behind	1
the	1
bush	1
where	1
oblonsky	1
stood	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
red	1
lightning	1
the	1
bird	1
dropped	1
like	1
an	1
arrow	1
and	1
darted	1
upwards	1
again	1
again	1
came	1
the	1
red	1
flash	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
blow	1
and	1
fluttering	1
its	1
wings	1
as	1
though	1
trying	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
the	1
bird	1
halted	1
stopped	1
still	1

only	1
whistling	1

at	1
the	1

heads	1
of	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
four	1
shots	1
and	1
like	1
swallows	1
the	1

turned	1
swift	1

light	1
low	1
down	1
in	1

out	1
the	1

again	1

to	1

little	1
longer	1
till	1
venus	1

he	1
saw	1
below	1
a	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1

was	1
quite	1
still	1
now	1
in	1

and	1
not	1
a	1

was	1
stirring	1
let	1
s	1
stay	1
a	1

answered	1
levin	1

standing	1
now	1
about	1
fifteen	1
paces	1
from	1

law	1

yet	1
or	1
when	1
she	1
s	1
going	1

levin	1
felt	1
so	1
resolute	1
and	1
serene	1
that	1
no	1
answer	1
he	1
fancied	1
could	1
affect	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
dreamed	1
of	1

never	1

reproachfully	1
at	1

at	1
that	1
very	1
instant	1
both	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
a	1
shrill	1
whistle	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
smote	1
on	1
their	1
ears	1
and	1
both	1
suddenly	1
seized	1
their	1
guns	1
and	1
two	1
flashes	1
gleamed	1
and	1
two	1
bangs	1
sounded	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
snipe	1
flying	1
high	1
above	1
instantly	1
folded	1
its	1
wings	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
thicket	1
bending	1
down	1
the	1
delicate	1
shoots	1
splendid	1
together	1
cried	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
with	1
laska	1
into	1
the	1
thicket	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
snipe	1
oh	1
yes	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
he	1

taking	1
the	1
warm	1
bird	1
from	1

s	1
mouth	1
and	1
packing	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
almost	1
full	1
game	1
bag	1
i	1
ve	1
got	1
it	1
stiva	1
he	1
shouted	1
chapter	1
16	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
home	1
levin	1
asked	1
all	1
details	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
illness	1
and	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
plans	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
ashamed	1
to	1
admit	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
heard	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
hope	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
pleased	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
suffering	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
suffer	1
so	1
much	1
but	1
when	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
illness	1
and	1
mentioned	1
vronsky	1
s	1
name	1
levin	1
cut	1
him	1
short	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
whatever	1
to	1
know	1
family	1
matters	1
and	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
them	1
either	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
hardly	1
perceptibly	1
catching	1
the	1
instantaneous	1
change	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
as	1
gloomy	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
bright	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
have	1
you	1
quite	1
settled	1
about	1
the	1
forest	1
with	1
ryabinin	1
asked	1
levin	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
settled	1
the	1
price	1
is	1
magnificent	1
thirty	1
eight	1
thousand	1
eight	1
straight	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
in	1
six	1
years	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
bothering	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
ever	1
so	1
long	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
give	1
more	1
then	1
you	1
ve	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
given	1
away	1
your	1
forest	1
for	1
nothing	1
said	1
levin	1
gloomily	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
for	1
nothing	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
humored	1
smile	1
knowing	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
be	1
right	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
eyes	1
now	1
because	1
the	1
forest	1
is	1
worth	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
roubles	1
the	1
acre	1
answered	1
levin	1
oh	1
these	1
farmers	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
playfully	1
your	1
tone	1
of	1
contempt	1
for	1
us	1
poor	1
townsfolk	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
business	1
we	1
do	1
it	1
better	1
than	1
anyone	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
i	1
have	1
reckoned	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
forest	1
is	1
fetching	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
price	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
of	1
this	1
fellow	1
s	1
crying	1
off	1
in	1
fact	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
timber	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
hoping	1
by	1
this	1
distinction	1
to	1
convince	1
levin	1
completely	1
of	1
the	1
unfairness	1
of	1
his	1
doubts	1
and	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
run	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
five	1
yards	1
of	1
fagots	1
per	1
acre	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
giving	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
seventy	1
roubles	1
the	1
acre	1
levin	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
i	1
know	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
fashion	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
him	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
city	1
people	1
who	1
after	1
being	1
twice	1
in	1
ten	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
pick	1
up	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
phrases	1
and	1
use	1
them	1
in	1
season	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
season	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
timber	1
run	1
to	1
so	1
many	1
yards	1
the	1
acre	1
	1
he	1
says	1
those	1
words	1
without	1
understanding	1
them	1
himself	1
i	1
wouldn	1

attempt	1

ryabinin	1
with	1
contemptuous	1

that	1

with	1

smiled	1
contemptuously	1

arkadyevitch	1
went	1
upstairs	1
with	1
his	1
pocket	1
bulging	1
with	1
notes	1
which	1
the	1

had	1

him	1
for	1
three	1

was	1
over	1
the	1

in	1
his	1
pocket	1
their	1
shooting	1
had	1
been	1
excellent	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
felt	1
specially	1
anxious	1
to	1
dissipate	1
the	1
ill	1
humor	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
levin	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
day	1
at	1
supper	1
as	1
pleasantly	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
begun	1
levin	1
certainly	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
humor	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
affectionate	1
and	1
cordial	1
to	1
his	1
charming	1
visitor	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
his	1
mood	1
the	1
intoxication	1
of	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
kitty	1
was	1
not	1
married	1
had	1
gradually	1
begun	1
to	1
work	1
upon	1
him	1
kitty	1
was	1
not	1
married	1
but	1
ill	1
and	1
ill	1
from	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
slighted	1
her	1
this	1
slight	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
rebounded	1
upon	1
him	1
vronsky	1
had	1
slighted	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
slighted	1
him	1
levin	1
consequently	1
vronsky	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
despise	1
levin	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
his	1
enemy	1
but	1
all	1
this	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
out	1
he	1
vaguely	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
insulting	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
angry	1
now	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
disturbed	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
fell	1
foul	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
presented	1
itself	1

stupid	1
sale	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
the	1
fraud	1

and	1
do	1
you	1

why	1
because	1
excuse	1
me	1
of	1
your	1
stupid	1
sale	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
frowned	1
good	1
humoredly	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
feels	1
himself	1
teased	1
and	1
attacked	1
for	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
come	1
enough	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
did	1
anybody	1
ever	1
sell	1
anything	1
without	1
being	1
told	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
sale	1
it	1
was	1
worth	1
much	1
more	1
but	1
when	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
sell	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
give	1
anything	1
no	1
i	1
see	1
you	1
ve	1
a	1
grudge	1
against	1
that	1
unlucky	1
ryabinin	1
maybe	1
i	1
have	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
ll	1
say	1
again	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
reactionist	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
terrible	1
word	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
it	1
does	1
annoy	1
and	1
anger	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
the	1
impoverishing	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
to	1
which	1
i	1
belong	1

in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
amalgamation	1
of	1
classes	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
to	1
belong	1
and	1
their	1
impoverishment	1
is	1
not	1
due	1
to	1
extravagance	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
living	1
in	1
good	1
style	1
that	1
s	1
the	1

joking	1
with	1

assuring	1
her	1
that	1

wanted	1
to	1
put	1

he	1
could	1
not	1

into	1

levin	1
still	1
lingered	1
in	1
his	1

talking	1
of	1
various	1

with	1

scowled	1
the	1
humiliation	1
of	1
his	1

stung	1
him	1
to	1

as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
fresh	1

he	1

interrupting	1
oblonsky	1
you	1

of	1

allow	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
it	1
consists	1
in	1
that	1
aristocracy	1
of	1
vronsky	1
or	1
of	1
anybody	1
else	1

a	1
man	1
whose	1

up	1
from	1

whom	1
she	1
wasn	1
t	1
mixed	1
up	1
with	1
no	1
excuse	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
consider	1
myself	1
aristocratic	1
and	1
people	1
like	1
me	1
who	1
can	1
point	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
to	1
three	1

four	1
honorable	1
generations	1
of	1

at	1

vronsky	1

mother	1
on	1
hearing	1
of	1
his	1
connection	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
pleased	1
at	1
it	1
because	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
gave	1
such	1
a	1
finishing	1
touch	1
to	1
a	1
brilliant	1
young	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
liaison	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
too	1
that	1
madame	1
karenina	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
taken	1
her	1
fancy	1
and	1
had	1
talked	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
was	1
after	1
all	1
just	1
like	1
all	1
other	1
pretty	1
and	1
well	1
bred	1
women	1
at	1
least	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
vronskaya	1
s	1
ideas	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
late	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
had	1
refused	1
a	1
position	1
offered	1
him	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
his	1
career	1
simply	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
constantly	1
seeing	1
madame	1
karenina	1
she	1
learned	1
that	1
great	1
personages	1
were	1
displeased	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
this	1
account	1
and	1
she	1
changed	1
her	1
opinion	1
she	1
was	1
vexed	1
too	1
that	1
from	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
learn	1
of	1
this	1
connection	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
brilliant	1
graceful	1
worldly	1
liaison	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
welcomed	1
but	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
wertherish	1
desperate	1
passion	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
told	1
which	1
might	1
well	1
lead	1
him	1
into	1
imprudence	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
his	1
abrupt	1
departure	1
from	1
moscow	1
and	1
she	1
sent	1
her	1
elder	1
son	1
to	1
bid	1
him	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
this	1
elder	1
son	1
too	1
was	1
displeased	1
with	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
distinguish	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
love	1
his	1
might	1
be	1
big	1
or	1
little	1
passionate	1
or	1
passionless	1
lasting	1
or	1
passing	1
he	1
kept	1
a	1
ballet	1
girl	1
himself	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
lenient	1
in	1
these	1
matters	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
love	1
affair	1
was	1
viewed	1
with	1
displeasure	1
by	1
those	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
please	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
conduct	1
besides	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
society	1
vronsky	1
had	1
another	1
great	1
interest	1
horses	1
he	1
was	1
passionately	1
fond	1
of	1
horses	1
that	1
year	1
races	1
and	1
a	1
steeplechase	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
for	1
the	1
officers	1
vronsky	1
had	1
put	1
his	1
name	1
down	1
bought	1
a	1
thoroughbred	1
english	1
mare	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
affair	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
races	1
with	1
intense	1
though	1
reserved	1
excitement	1
these	1
two	1
passions	1
did	1
not	1
interfere	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
needed	1
occupation	1
and	1
distraction	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
love	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
recruit	1
and	1
rest	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
violent	1
emotions	1
that	1
agitated	1
him	1
chapter	1
19	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
races	1
at	1
krasnoe	1
selo	1
vronsky	1
had	1
come	1
earlier	1
than	1
usual	1
to	1
eat	1
beefsteak	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
messroom	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
strict	1
with	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
very	1
quickly	1
been	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
required	1
light	1
weight	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
avoid	1
gaining	1
flesh	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
eschewed	1
farinaceous	1
and	1
sweet	1
dishes	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
coat	1
unbuttoned	1
over	1
a	1
white	1
waistcoat	1
resting	1
both	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
while	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
steak	1
he	1
had	1
ordered	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
french	1
novel	1
that	1
lay	1
open	1
on	1
his	1
plate	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
book	1
to	1
avoid	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
coming	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
promise	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
that	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
races	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
today	1
or	1
not	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
last	1
interview	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
his	1
cousin	1
betsy	1
s	1
summer	1
villa	1
he	1
visited	1
the	1
karenins	1
summer	1
villa	1
as	1
rarely	1
as	1
possible	1
now	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
and	1
he	1
pondered	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
shall	1
say	1
betsy	1
has	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
whether	1
she	1
s	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
races	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
ll	1
go	1
he	1
decided	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
vividly	1
pictured	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
his	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
send	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
have	1
out	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
three	1
horses	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
steak	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
silver	1
dish	1
and	1
moving	1
the	1
dish	1
up	1
he	1
began	1
eating	1
from	1
the	1
billiard	1
room	1
next	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
balls	1
knocking	1
of	1
talk	1
and	1
laughter	1
two	1
officers	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
door	1
one	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
with	1
a	1
feeble	1
delicate	1
face	1
who	1
had	1
lately	1
joined	1
the	1
regiment	1
from	1
the	1
corps	1
of	1
pages	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
plump	1
elderly	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bracelet	1
on	1
his	1
wrist	1
and	1
little	1
eyes	1
lost	1
in	1
fat	1
vronsky	1
glanced	1
at	1
them	1
frowned	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
book	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
them	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
read	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
what	1
fortifying	1
yourself	1
for	1
your	1
work	1
said	1
the	1
plump	1
officer	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
responded	1
vronsky	1
knitting	1
his	1
brows	1
wiping	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
so	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
getting	1
fat	1
said	1
the	1
latter	1
turning	1
a	1
chair	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
what	1
said	1
vronsky	1
angrily	1
making	1
a	1
wry	1
face	1
of	1
disgust	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
even	1
teeth	1

vronsky	1
without	1
replying	1
and	1
moving	1
the	1
book	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
the	1
plump	1
officer	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
wines	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
you	1
choose	1
what	1
we	1
re	1
to	1

said	1
handing	1
him	1
the	1
card	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
rhine	1
wine	1
please	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
stealing	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
at	1
vronsky	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
pull	1
his	1
scarcely	1
visible	1
mustache	1
seeing	1
that	1
vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
round	1

young	1
officer	1

up	1
let	1

go	1
into	1
the	1
billiard	1
room	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
plump	1
officer	1
rose	1
submissively	1
and	1
they	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
there	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
tall	1
and	1
well	1
built	1
captain	1
yashvin	1
nodding	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
lofty	1
contempt	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
officers	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
vronsky	1
ah	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
he	1
cried	1
bringing	1
his	1
big	1
hand	1
down	1
heavily	1
on	1
his	1
epaulet	1
vronsky	1
looked	1
round	1
angrily	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
immediately	1
with	1
his	1
characteristic	1
expression	1
of	1
genial	1
and	1
manly	1
serenity	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
alexey	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
in	1
his	1
loud	1
baritone	1
you	1
must	1
just	1
eat	1
a	1
mouthful	1
now	1
and	1
drink	1
only	1
one	1
tiny	1
glass	1
oh	1

the	1
inseparables	1
yashvin	1
dropped	1
glancing	1
sarcastically	1
at	1
the	1
two	1
officers	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
leaving	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
swathed	1
in	1
tight	1
riding	1
breeches	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
chair	1
too	1
low	1
for	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
knees	1
were	1
cramped	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
sharp	1
angle	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1

was	1
late	1
at	1
the	1
tverskoys	1
said	1
vronsky	1
ah	1
responded	1
yashvin	1
yashvin	1
a	1
gambler	1
and	1
a	1
rake	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
merely	1
without	1
moral	1
principles	1
but	1
of	1
immoral	1
principles	1
yashvin	1
was	1
vronsky	1
s	1
greatest	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
vronsky	1
liked	1
him	1
both	1
for	1
his	1
exceptional	1
physical	1
strength	1
which	1
he	1
showed	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
by	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
drink	1
like	1
a	1
fish	1
and	1
do	1
without	1
sleep	1
without	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
degree	1
affected	1
by	1
it	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
strength	1
of	1
character	1
which	1
he	1
showed	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
comrades	1
and	1
superior	1
officers	1
commanding	1
both	1
fear	1
and	1
respect	1
and	1
also	1
at	1
cards	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
play	1
for	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
and	1
however	1
much	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
drunk	1
always	1
with	1
such	1
skill	1
and	1
decision	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
reckoned	1
the	1
best	1
player	1
in	1
the	1
english	1
club	1
vronsky	1
respected	1
and	1
liked	1
yashvin	1
particularly	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
yashvin	1
liked	1
him	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
his	1
money	1
but	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
with	1
whom	1
vronsky	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
yashvin	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
apparent	1
contempt	1
for	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
feeling	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
so	1
he	1
fancied	1
comprehend	1
the	1
intense	1
passion	1
which	1
now	1
filled	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
moreover	1
he	1
felt	1
certain	1
that	1
yashvin	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
took	1
no	1
delight	1
in	1
gossip	1
and	1
scandal	1
and	1
interpreted	1
his	1
feeling	1
rightly	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
knew	1
and	1
believed	1
that	1
this	1
passion	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
jest	1
not	1
a	1
pastime	1
but	1
something	1
more	1
serious	1
and	1
important	1
vronsky	1
had	1
never	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
passion	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
right	1
interpretation	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
ah	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
announcement	1
that	1
vronsky	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
tverskoys	1
and	1
his	1
black	1
eyes	1
shining	1
he	1
plucked	1
at	1
his	1
left	1
mustache	1
and	1
began	1
twisting	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
mouth	1
a	1
bad	1
habit	1
he	1
had	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
yesterday	1
win	1
anything	1
asked	1
vronsky	1
eight	1
thousand	1
but	1
three	1

up	1

about	1

of	1

vronsky	1

crumpling	1
up	1
the	1

thrust	1
them	1
between	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
his	1

of	1

yashvin	1
standing	1
over	1

top	1
vronsky	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
beginning	1
prematurely	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
little	1
bald	1
he	1
laughed	1
gaily	1
showing	1
his	1
even	1
teeth	1
and	1
pulling	1
his	1
cap	1
over	1
the	1
thin	1
place	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
carriage	1
to	1
the	1
stables	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
pulling	1
out	1
the	1
letters	1
to	1
read	1
them	1
through	1
but	1
he	1
thought	1
better	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
put	1
off	1
reading	1
them	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
distract	1
his	1
attention	1
before	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
mare	1
later	1
chapter	1

the	1
temporary	1
stable	1
a	1
wooden	1
shed	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
up	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
and	1
there	1
his	1
mare	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
her	1
there	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
ridden	1
her	1
out	1
for	1
exercise	1
himself	1
but	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
trainer	1
and	1
so	1
now	1
he	1
positively	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
in	1
what	1
condition	1
his	1
mare	1
had	1
arrived	1
yesterday	1
and	1
was	1
today	1
he	1
had	1
scarcely	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
when	1
his	1
groom	1
the	1
so	1
called	1
stable	1
boy	1
recognizing	1
the	1
carriage	1
some	1
way	1
off	1
called	1
the	1
trainer	1
a	1
dry	1
looking	1
englishman	1
in	1
high	1
boots	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
jacket	1
clean	1
shaven	1
except	1
for	1
a	1
tuft	1
below	1
his	1
chin	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
walking	1
with	1
the	1
uncouth	1
gait	1
of	1
jockey	1
turning	1
his	1
elbows	1
out	1
and	1
swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
well	1
how	1
s	1
frou	1
frou	1
vronsky	1
asked	1
in	1
english	1
all	1
right	1
sir	1
the	1
englishman	1
s	1
voice	1
responded	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
his	1
throat	1
better	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
he	1
added	1
touching	1
his	1
hat	1
i	1

put	1
a	1
muzzle	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
mare	1

i	1
m	1
going	1
in	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
come	1
along	1
then	1
said	1
the	1
englishman	1
frowning	1
and	1
speaking	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
shut	1
and	1
with	1
swinging	1
elbows	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
front	1
with	1
his	1
disjointed	1
gait	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
yard	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
a	1
stable	1
boy	1
spruce	1
and	1
smart	1
in	1
his	1
holiday	1
attire	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
broom	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
followed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
shed	1
there	1
were	1
five	1
horses	1
in	1
their	1
separate	1
stalls	1
and	1
vronsky	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
chief	1
rival	1
gladiator	1
a	1
very	1
tall	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
there	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
standing	1
among	1
them	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
mare	1
vronsky	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
gladiator	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
etiquette	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
horse	1
but	1
improper	1
even	1
to	1
ask	1
questions	1
about	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
passing	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
the	1
boy	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
horse	1
box	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
and	1
vronsky	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
a	1
big	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
with	1
white	1
legs	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
gladiator	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
another	1
man	1
s	1
open	1
letter	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
went	1

at	1
the	1

to	1
his	1
riding	1
in	1
a	1
steeplechase	1
it	1
all	1
depends	1
on	1
riding	1
and	1
on	1
pluck	1
said	1
the	1
englishman	1
of	1
pluck	1
that	1
is	1
energy	1
and	1
courage	1
vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
enough	1
what	1
was	1
of	1
far	1
more	1
importance	1
he	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
have	1
more	1
of	1
this	1
pluck	1

mare	1
s	1
fidgety	1
he	1
added	1
nodding	1
towards	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
before	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
standing	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
restless	1
stamping	1
in	1
the	1
straw	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
vronsky	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
dimly	1
lighted	1
by	1
one	1
little	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
stood	1
a	1
dark	1
bay	1
mare	1
with	1
a	1
muzzle	1
on	1
picking	1
at	1
the	1
fresh	1
straw	1
with	1
her	1
hoofs	1
looking	1
round	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
vronsky	1
unconsciously	1
took	1
in	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
a	1
comprehensive	1
glance	1
all	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
his	1
favorite	1
mare	1
frou	1
frou	1
was	1
a	1
beast	1
of	1
medium	1
size	1
not	1
altogether	1
free	1
from	1
reproach	1
from	1
a	1
breeder	1
s	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
she	1
was	1
small	1
boned	1
all	1
over	1
though	1
her	1
chest	1
was	1
extremely	1
prominent	1
in	1
front	1
it	1
was	1
narrow	1
her	1
hind	1
quarters	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
drooping	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
fore	1
legs	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
in	1
her	1
hind	1
legs	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
noticeable	1
curvature	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
both	1
hind	1
and	1
fore	1
legs	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
thick	1
but	1
across	1
her	1
shoulders	1
the	1
mare	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
broad	1
a	1
peculiarity	1
specially	1
striking	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
lean	1
from	1
training	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
her	1
legs	1
below	1
the	1
knees	1
looked	1
no	1
thicker	1
than	1
a	1
finger	1
from	1
in	1
front	1
but	1
were	1
extraordinarily	1
thick	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
side	1
she	1
looked	1
altogether	1
except	1
across	1
the	1
shoulders	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
pinched	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
sides	1
and	1
pressed	1
out	1
in	1
depth	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
the	1
quality	1
that	1
makes	1
all	1
defects	1
forgotten	1
that	1
quality	1
was	1
blood	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
tells	1
as	1
the	1
english	1
expression	1
has	1
it	1
the	1
muscles	1
stood	1
up	1
sharply	1
under	1
the	1
network	1
of	1
sinews	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
delicate	1
mobile	1
skin	1
soft	1
as	1
satin	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
hard	1
as	1
bone	1
her	1
clean	1
cut	1
head	1
with	1
prominent	1
bright	1
spirited	1
eyes	1
broadened	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
nostrils	1
that	1
showed	1
the	1
red	1
blood	1
in	1
the	1
cartilage	1
within	1
about	1
all	1
her	1
figure	1
and	1
especially	1
her	1
head	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
expression	1
of	1
energy	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
of	1
softness	1
she	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
creatures	1
which	1
seem	1
only	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
because	1
the	1
mechanism	1
of	1
their	1
mouth	1
does	1
not	1
allow	1
them	1
to	1
to	1
vronsky	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
all	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
directly	1
vronsky	1
went	1
towards	1
her	1
she	1
drew	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
and	1
turning	1
back	1
her	1
prominent	1
eye	1
till	1
the	1
white	1
looked	1
bloodshot	1
she	1
started	1
at	1
the	1
approaching	1
figures	1
from	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
shaking	1
her	1
muzzle	1
and	1
shifting	1
lightly	1
from	1
one	1
leg	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
there	1
you	1
see	1
how	1
fidgety	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
the	1
englishman	1
there	1
darling	1
there	1
said	1
vronsky	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mare	1
and	1
speaking	1
soothingly	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
came	1
the	1
more	1
excited	1
she	1
grew	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
was	1
suddenly	1
quieter	1
while	1
the	1
muscles	1
quivered	1
under	1
her	1
soft	1
delicate	1
coat	1
vronsky	1
patted	1
her	1
strong	1
neck	1
straightened	1
over	1
her	1
sharp	1
withers	1
a	1
stray	1
lock	1
of	1
her	1
mane	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
and	1
moved	1
his	1
face	1
near	1
her	1
dilated	1
nostrils	1
transparent	1
as	1
a	1
bat	1
s	1
wing	1
she	1
drew	1
a	1
loud	1
breath	1
and	1
snorted	1
out	1
through	1
her	1
tense	1
nostrils	1
started	1
pricked	1
up	1
her	1
sharp	1
ear	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
her	1
strong	1
black	1
lip	1
towards	1
vronsky	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
nip	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
sleeve	1
but	1
remembering	1
the	1
muzzle	1
she	1
shook	1
it	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
restlessly	1
stamping	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
her	1
shapely	1
legs	1
quiet	1
darling	1
quiet	1
he	1
said	1
patting	1
her	1
again	1
over	1
her	1
hind	1
quarters	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
glad	1
sense	1
that	1
his	1
mare	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
condition	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
the	1
mare	1
s	1
excitement	1
had	1
infected	1
vronsky	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
throbbing	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
like	1
the	1
mare	1
longed	1
to	1
move	1
to	1
bite	1
it	1
was	1
both	1
dreadful	1
and	1
delicious	1
well	1
i	1
rely	1
on	1
you	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
englishman	1
half	1
past	1
six	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
all	1
right	1
said	1
the	1
englishman	1
oh	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
my	1
lord	1
he	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
using	1
the	1
title	1
my	1
lord	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
used	1
before	1
vronsky	1
in	1
amazement	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
stared	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
stare	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
englishman	1
s	1
eyes	1
but	1
at	1
his	1
forehead	1
astounded	1
at	1
the	1
impertinence	1
of	1
his	1
question	1
but	1
realizing	1
that	1
in	1
asking	1
this	1
the	1
englishman	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
employer	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
jockey	1
he	1
answered	1
i	1
ve	1
got	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bryansky	1
s	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
home	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
how	1
often	1
i	1
m	1
asked	1
that	1
question	1
today	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
blushed	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
rarely	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
englishman	1
looked	1
gravely	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
too	1
knew	1
where	1
vronsky	1
was	1
going	1
he	1
added	1
the	1
great	1
thing	1
s	1
to	1
keep	1
quiet	1
before	1
a	1
race	1
said	1
he	1
don	1
t	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
or	1
upset	1
about	1
anything	1
all	1
right	1
answered	1
vronsky	1
smiling	1
and	1
jumping	1
into	1
his	1
carriage	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
peterhof	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
many	1
paces	1
away	1
the	1
dark	1
clouds	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
threatening	1
rain	1
all	1
day	1
broke	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
heavy	1
downpour	1
of	1
rain	1
what	1
a	1
pity	1
thought	1
vronsky	1
putting	1
up	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
it	1
was	1
muddy	1
before	1
now	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
perfect	1
swamp	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
solitude	1
in	1
the	1
closed	1
carriage	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
letter	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
note	1
and	1
read	1
them	1
through	1
yes	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
everyone	1
his	1
mother	1
his	1
brother	1
everyone	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
interfere	1
in	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
this	1
interference	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
angry	1
hatred	1
a	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
rarely	1
known	1
before	1
what	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
theirs	1
why	1
does	1
everybody	1
feel	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
concern	1
himself	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
why	1
do	1
they	1
worry	1
me	1
so	1
just	1
because	1
they	1
see	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
something	1
they	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
common	1
vulgar	1
worldly	1
intrigue	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
alone	1
they	1
feel	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
something	1
different	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
mere	1
pastime	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
is	1
dearer	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
life	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
incomprehensible	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
it	1
annoys	1
them	1
whatever	1
our	1
destiny	1
is	1
or	1
may	1
be	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
ourselves	1
and	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
complain	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
we	1
linking	1
himself	1
with	1
anna	1
no	1
they	1
must	1
needs	1
teach	1
us	1
how	1
to	1
live	1
they	1
haven	1
t	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
happiness	1
is	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
that	1
without	1
our	1
love	1
for	1
us	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
happiness	1
nor	1
unhappiness	1
no	1
life	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
interference	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
right	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
anna	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
momentary	1
impulse	1
which	1
would	1
pass	1
as	1
worldly	1
intrigues	1
do	1
pass	1
leaving	1
no	1
other	1
traces	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
either	1
but	1
pleasant	1
or	1
unpleasant	1
memories	1
he	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
torture	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
her	1
position	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
there	1
was	1
for	1
them	1
conspicuous	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
concealing	1
their	1
love	1
in	1
lying	1
and	1
deceiving	1
and	1
in	1
lying	1
deceiving	1
feigning	1
and	1
continually	1
thinking	1
of	1
others	1
when	1
the	1
passion	1
that	1
united	1
them	1
was	1
so	1
intense	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
oblivious	1
of	1
everything	1
else	1
but	1
their	1
love	1
he	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
constantly	1
recurring	1
instances	1
of	1
inevitable	1
necessity	1
for	1
lying	1
and	1
deceit	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
against	1
his	1
natural	1
bent	1
he	1
recalled	1
particularly	1
vividly	1
the	1
shame	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
detected	1
in	1
her	1
at	1
this	1
necessity	1
for	1
lying	1
and	1
deceit	1
and	1
he	1
experienced	1
the	1
strange	1
feeling	1
that	1
had	1
sometimes	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
since	1
his	1
secret	1
love	1
for	1
anna	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
loathing	1
for	1
something	1
whether	1
for	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
or	1
for	1
himself	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
but	1
he	1
always	1
drove	1
away	1
this	1
strange	1
feeling	1
now	1
too	1
he	1
shook	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
continued	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
yes	1
she	1
was	1
unhappy	1
before	1
but	1
proud	1
and	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
feel	1
secure	1
in	1
her	1
dignity	1
though	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
show	1
it	1
yes	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
it	1
he	1
decided	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
idea	1
clearly	1
presented	1
itself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
essential	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
this	1
false	1
position	1
and	1
the	1
sooner	1
the	1
better	1
throw	1
up	1
everything	1
she	1
and	1
i	1
and	1
hide	1
ourselves	1
somewhere	1
alone	1
with	1
our	1
love	1

by	1

out	1

from	1

from	1

he	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
shower	1
spoiling	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
but	1
was	1
rejoicing	1
now	1
that	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
rain	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
alone	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
who	1
had	1
lately	1
returned	1
from	1
a	1
foreign	1
watering	1
place	1
had	1
not	1
moved	1
from	1
petersburg	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
alone	1
vronsky	1
alighted	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
to	1
avoid	1
attracting	1
attention	1
before	1
crossing	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
street	1
door	1
but	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
has	1
your	1
master	1
come	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
gardener	1
no	1
sir	1
the	1
mistress	1
is	1
at	1
home	1
but	1
will	1
you	1
please	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
there	1
are	1
servants	1
there	1
the	1
gardener	1
answered	1
they	1
ll	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
no	1
i	1
ll	1
go	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
feeling	1
satisfied	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
alone	1
and	1
wanting	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
by	1
surprise	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
today	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
certainly	1
not	1
expect	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
the	1
races	1
he	1
walked	1
holding	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
stepping	1
cautiously	1
over	1
the	1
sandy	1
path	1
bordered	1
with	1
flowers	1
to	1
the	1
terrace	1
that	1
looked	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
garden	1
vronsky	1
forgot	1
now	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
hardships	1
and	1
difficulties	1
of	1
their	1
position	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
her	1
directly	1
not	1
in	1
imagination	1
but	1
living	1
all	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
in	1
stepping	1
on	1
his	1
whole	1
foot	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
creak	1
up	1
the	1
worn	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
terrace	1
when	1
he	1
suddenly	1
remembered	1
what	1
he	1
always	1
forgot	1
and	1
what	1
caused	1
the	1
most	1
torturing	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
her	1
her	1
son	1
with	1
his	1
questioning	1
hostile	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
eyes	1
this	1
boy	1
was	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
anyone	1
else	1
a	1
check	1
upon	1
their	1
freedom	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
present	1
both	1
vronsky	1
and	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
avoid	1
speaking	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
repeated	1
before	1
everyone	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
allow	1
themselves	1
to	1
refer	1
by	1
hints	1
to	1
anything	1
the	1
boy	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
no	1
agreement	1
about	1
this	1
it	1
had	1
settled	1
itself	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
it	1
wounding	1
themselves	1
to	1
deceive	1
the	1
child	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
they	1
talked	1
like	1
acquaintances	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
caution	1
vronsky	1
often	1
saw	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
intent	1
bewildered	1
glance	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
shyness	1
uncertainty	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
friendliness	1
at	1
another	1
coldness	1
and	1
reserve	1
in	1
the	1
boy	1
s	1
manner	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
child	1
felt	1
that	1
between	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
there	1
existed	1
some	1
important	1
bond	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
as	1
a	1
fact	1
the	1
boy	1
did	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
this	1
relation	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
painfully	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
clear	1
to	1
himself	1
what	1
feeling	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
child	1
s	1
keen	1
instinct	1
for	1
every	1
manifestation	1
of	1
feeling	1
he	1
saw	1
distinctly	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
his	1
governess	1
his	1
nurse	1
all	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
dislike	1
vronsky	1
but	1
looked	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
aversion	1
though	1
they	1
never	1
said	1
anything	1
about	1
him	1
while	1
his	1
mother	1
looked	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
her	1
greatest	1
friend	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
how	1
ought	1
i	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
if	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
my	1
fault	1
either	1
i	1
m	1
stupid	1
or	1
a	1
naughty	1
boy	1
thought	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
caused	1
his	1
dubious	1
inquiring	1
sometimes	1
hostile	1
expression	1
and	1
the	1
shyness	1
and	1
uncertainty	1
which	1
vronsky	1
found	1
so	1
irksome	1
this	1
child	1
s	1
presence	1
always	1
and	1
infallibly	1
called	1
up	1
in	1
vronsky	1
that	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
inexplicable	1
loathing	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
of	1
late	1
this	1
child	1
s	1
presence	1
called	1
up	1
both	1
in	1
vronsky	1
and	1
in	1
anna	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
sailor	1
who	1
sees	1
by	1
the	1
compass	1
that	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
swiftly	1
moving	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
one	1
but	1
that	1
to	1
arrest	1
his	1
motion	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
that	1
every	1
instant	1
is	1
carrying	1
him	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
away	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
admit	1
to	1
himself	1
his	1
deviation	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
direction	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
admitting	1
his	1
certain	1
ruin	1
this	1
child	1
with	1
his	1
innocent	1
outlook	1
upon	1
life	1
was	1
the	1
compass	1
that	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
point	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
departed	1
from	1
what	1
they	1
knew	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
this	1
time	1
seryozha	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
completely	1
alone	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
for	1
his	1
walk	1
and	1
been	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
rain	1
she	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1
manservant	1
and	1
a	1
maid	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
gown	1
deeply	1
embroidered	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
terrace	1
behind	1
some	1
flowers	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him	1
bending	1
her	1
curly	1
black	1
head	1
she	1
pressed	1
her	1
forehead	1
against	1
a	1
cool	1
watering	1
pot	1
that	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
parapet	1
and	1
both	1
her	1
lovely	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
rings	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
clasped	1
the	1
pot	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
whole	1
figure	1
her	1
head	1
her	1
neck	1
her	1
hands	1
struck	1
vronsky	1
every	1
time	1
as	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
unexpected	1
he	1
stood	1
still	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
ecstasy	1
but	1
directly	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
step	1
to	1
come	1
nearer	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
watering	1
pot	1
and	1
turned	1
her	1
flushed	1
face	1
towards	1
him	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
you	1
are	1
ill	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
french	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
run	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
remembering	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
spectators	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
towards	1
the	1
balcony	1
door	1
and	1
reddened	1
a	1
little	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
reddened	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
and	1
be	1
on	1
his	1
guard	1
no	1
i	1
m	1
quite	1
well	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
pressing	1
his	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
tightly	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
thee	1
mercy	1
what	1
cold	1
hands	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
startled	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
i	1
m	1
alone	1
and	1
expecting	1
seryozha	1
he	1
s	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
they	1
ll	1
come	1
in	1
from	1
this	1
side	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
efforts	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
quivering	1
forgive	1
me	1
for	1
coming	1
but	1
i	1
couldn	1
t	1
pass	1
the	1
day	1
without	1
seeing	1
you	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
speaking	1
french	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
to	1
avoid	1
using	1
the	1
stiff	1
russian	1
plural	1
form	1
so	1
impossibly	1
frigid	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
dangerously	1
intimate	1
singular	1
forgive	1
you	1
i	1
m	1
so	1
glad	1
but	1
you	1
re	1
ill	1
or	1
worried	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
not	1
letting	1
go	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
bending	1
over	1
her	1
what	1
were	1
you	1
thinking	1
of	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
she	1
spoke	1
the	1
truth	1
if	1
ever	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
answered	1
truly	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
of	1
her	1
happiness	1
and	1
her	1
unhappiness	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
just	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
of	1
this	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
she	1
wondered	1
that	1
to	1
others	1
to	1
betsy	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
her	1
secret	1
connection	1
with	1
tushkevitch	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
easy	1
while	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
torture	1
today	1
this	1
thought	1
gained	1
special	1
poignancy	1
from	1
certain	1
other	1
considerations	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
races	1
he	1
answered	1
her	1
questions	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
agitated	1
trying	1
to	1
calm	1
her	1
he	1
began	1
telling	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
simplest	1
tone	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
races	1
tell	1
him	1
or	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
into	1
his	1
quiet	1
affectionate	1
eyes	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
happy	1
so	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
races	1
that	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
understand	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
understand	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
this	1
fact	1
to	1
us	1
but	1
you	1
haven	1
t	1
told	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
thinking	1
of	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
interrupting	1
his	1
narrative	1
please	1
tell	1
me	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
bending	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
she	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows	1
her	1
eyes	1
shining	1
under	1
their	1
long	1
lashes	1
her	1
hand	1
shook	1
as	1
it	1
played	1
with	1
a	1
leaf	1
she	1
had	1
picked	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
expressed	1
that	1
utter	1
subjection	1
that	1
slavish	1
devotion	1
which	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
win	1
her	1
i	1
see	1
something	1
has	1
happened	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
i	1
can	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
knowing	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
trouble	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
sharing	1
tell	1
me	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
he	1
repeated	1
imploringly	1
yes	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
realize	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
it	1
better	1
not	1
tell	1
why	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
proof	1
she	1
thought	1
still	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
and	1
feeling	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
held	1
the	1
leaf	1
was	1
trembling	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
he	1
repeated	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
shall	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
yes	1
yes	1
yes	1
i	1
m	1
with	1
child	1
she	1
said	1
softly	1
and	1
deliberately	1
the	1
leaf	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
shook	1
more	1
violently	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
watching	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
it	1
he	1
turned	1
white	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
something	1
but	1
stopped	1
he	1
dropped	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
sank	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
yes	1
he	1
realizes	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
gratefully	1
she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
mistaken	1
in	1
thinking	1
he	1
realized	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
as	1
she	1
a	1
woman	1
realized	1
it	1
on	1
hearing	1
it	1
he	1
felt	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
tenfold	1
intensity	1
that	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
loathing	1
of	1
someone	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
turning	1
point	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
longing	1
for	1
had	1
come	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
concealing	1
things	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
inevitable	1
in	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
soon	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
their	1
unnatural	1
position	1
but	1
besides	1
that	1
her	1
emotion	1
physically	1
affected	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
submissive	1
tenderness	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
terrace	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
going	1
up	1

the	1

alexey	1

said	1
softly	1

was	1
calmer	1
now	1
and	1
her	1

up	1

answered	1
scarcely	1
audibly	1
yes	1
but	1
altogether	1
altogether	1
but	1
how	1
alexey	1

me	1
how	1
she	1

in	1
melancholy	1

at	1

must	1
take	1
our	1
line	1

said	1
anything	1
s	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
re	1
living	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
see	1
how	1
you	1
torture	1
yourself	1
over	1
everything	1

and	1
your	1
son	1
and	1
your	1

oh	1

with	1
a	1

i	1

said	1
and	1
suddenly	1
a	1
hot	1
flush	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
her	1
cheeks	1
her	1
brow	1
her	1
neck	1
crimsoned	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
shame	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
we	1
won	1

of	1
him	1
chapter	1

vronsky	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
already	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
resolutely	1
as	1
now	1
tried	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
to	1
consider	1
their	1
position	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
confronted	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
superficiality	1
and	1
triviality	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
met	1
his	1
appeal	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
in	1
this	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
or	1
would	1
not	1
face	1
as	1
though	1
directly	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
this	1
she	1
the	1
real	1
anna	1
retreated	1
somehow	1
into	1
herself	1
and	1
another	1
strange	1
and	1
unaccountable	1
woman	1
came	1
out	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
feared	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
today	1
he	1
was	1
resolved	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
out	1
whether	1
he	1
knows	1
or	1
not	1
said	1
vronsky	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
quiet	1
and	1
resolute	1
tone	1
that	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
us	1
we	1
cannot	1
you	1
cannot	1
stay	1
like	1
this	1
especially	1
now	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
asked	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
frivolous	1
irony	1
she	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
feared	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
her	1
condition	1
too	1
lightly	1
was	1
now	1
vexed	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
deducing	1
from	1
it	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
taking	1
some	1
step	1
tell	1
him	1
everything	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
very	1
well	1
let	1
us	1
suppose	1
i	1
do	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
i	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
all	1
beforehand	1
and	1
a	1
wicked	1
light	1
gleamed	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
soft	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
eh	1
you	1
love	1
another	1
man	1
and	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
criminal	1
intrigues	1
with	1
him	1
mimicking	1
her	1
husband	1
she	1
threw	1
an	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
criminal	1
as	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
did	1
i	1
warned	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
results	1
in	1
the	1
religious	1
the	1
civil	1
and	1
the	1
domestic	1
relation	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
listened	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
i	1
cannot	1
let	1
you	1
disgrace	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
about	1
her	1
son	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
jest	1
disgrace	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
and	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
general	1
terms	1
he	1
ll	1
say	1
in	1
his	1
official	1
manner	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
distinctness	1
and	1
precision	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
but	1
will	1
take	1
all	1
measures	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
prevent	1
scandal	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
calmly	1
and	1
punctually	1
act	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
words	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
will	1
happen	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
a	1
machine	1
and	1
a	1
spiteful	1
machine	1
when	1
he	1
s	1
angry	1
she	1
added	1
recalling	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
his	1
figure	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking	1
and	1
reckoning	1
against	1
him	1
every	1
defect	1
she	1
could	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
softening	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
wrong	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
doing	1
him	1
but	1
anna	1
said	1
vronsky	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
and	1
persuasive	1
voice	1
trying	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
we	1
absolutely	1
must	1
anyway	1
tell	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
the	1
line	1
he	1
takes	1
what	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
why	1
not	1
run	1
away	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
how	1
we	1
can	1
keep	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
suffer	1
yes	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
become	1
your	1
mistress	1
she	1
said	1
angrily	1
anna	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
reproachful	1
tenderness	1
yes	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
become	1
your	1
mistress	1
and	1
complete	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
again	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
my	1
son	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
that	1
word	1
vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
how	1
she	1
with	1
her	1
strong	1
and	1
truthful	1
nature	1
could	1
endure	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
deceit	1
and	1
not	1
long	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
suspect	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
son	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
pronounce	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
future	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
abandoned	1
his	1
father	1
she	1
felt	1
such	1
terror	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
face	1
it	1
but	1
like	1
a	1
woman	1
could	1
only	1
try	1
to	1
comfort	1
herself	1
with	1
lying	1
assurances	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
remain	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
fearful	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
with	1
her	1
son	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
i	1
entreat	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
suddenly	1
taking	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
speaking	1
in	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
tone	1
sincere	1
and	1
tender	1
never	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
that	1
but	1
anna	1
never	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
baseness	1
all	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
arrange	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
do	1
what	1
i	1
say	1
never	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
do	1
you	1
promise	1
me	1
no	1
no	1

i	1
promise	1
everything	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1

after	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
when	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
i	1
she	1
repeated	1
yes	1
i	1
am	1
worried	1
sometimes	1
but	1
that	1
will	1
pass	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
talk	1
about	1
this	1
when	1
you	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
then	1
it	1
worries	1
me	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
know	1
she	1
interrupted	1
him	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
truthful	1
nature	1
to	1
lie	1
and	1
i	1
grieve	1
for	1
you	1
i	1
often	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
ruined	1
your	1
whole	1
life	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
just	1
thinking	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
thing	1
he	1
said	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
sacrifice	1
everything	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
myself	1
that	1
you	1

closer	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
ecstatic	1
smile	1
of	1
love	1
i	1
am	1
like	1
a	1

who	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
food	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
cold	1
and	1
dressed	1
in	1
rags	1
and	1
ashamed	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
unhappy	1
i	1
unhappy	1
no	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
unhappiness	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
voice	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
and	1
glancing	1
swiftly	1
round	1
the	1
terrace	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
impulsively	1
her	1
eyes	1
glowed	1
with	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
movement	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
lovely	1
hands	1
covered	1
with	1
rings	1
took	1
his	1
head	1
looked	1
a	1
long	1
look	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
putting	1
up	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
smiling	1
parted	1
lips	1
swiftly	1
kissed	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
both	1
eyes	1
and	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
but	1
he	1
held	1
her	1
back	1
when	1
he	1
murmured	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
gazing	1
in	1
ecstasy	1
at	1
her	1
tonight	1
at	1
one	1
o	1
clock	1
she	1
whispered	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
sigh	1
she	1
walked	1
with	1
her	1
light	1
swift	1
step	1
to	1
meet	1

been	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1

in	1

and	1
his	1
nurse	1
had	1
taken	1
shelter	1
in	1
an	1
arbor	1

vronsky	1
i	1
must	1
soon	1
be	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
races	1
betsy	1
promised	1
to	1
fetch	1
me	1
vronsky	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
went	1
away	1
hurriedly	1
chapter	1
24	1
when	1
vronsky	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
on	1
the	1
karenins	1
balcony	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
greatly	1
agitated	1
and	1
lost	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
figures	1
on	1
the	1
watch	1
s	1
face	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
in	1
what	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
highroad	1
and	1
walked	1
picking	1
his	1
way	1
carefully	1
through	1
the	1
mud	1
to	1
his	1
carriage	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
completely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
anna	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
what	1
o	1
clock	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bryansky	1
s	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
only	1
the	1
external	1
faculty	1
of	1
memory	1
that	1
points	1
out	1
each	1
step	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
take	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
coachman	1
who	1
was	1
dozing	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
already	1
lengthening	1
of	1
a	1
thick	1
limetree	1
he	1
admired	1
the	1
shifting	1
clouds	1
of	1
midges	1
circling	1
over	1
the	1
hot	1
horses	1
and	1
waking	1
the	1
coachman	1
he	1
jumped	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
bryansky	1
s	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
after	1
driving	1
nearly	1
five	1
miles	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sufficiently	1
recovered	1
himself	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
and	1
realize	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
half	1
past	1
five	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
late	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
races	1
fixed	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
mounted	1
guards	1
race	1
then	1
the	1
officers	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
race	1
then	1
the	1
three	1
mile	1
race	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
race	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
entered	1
he	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
his	1
race	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
bryansky	1
s	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
just	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
arrive	1
when	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pity	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
bryansky	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
drive	1
on	1
telling	1
the	1
coachman	1
not	1
to	1
spare	1
the	1
horses	1
he	1
reached	1
bryansky	1
s	1
spent	1
five	1
minutes	1
there	1
and	1
galloped	1
back	1
this	1
rapid	1
drive	1
calmed	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
painful	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
anna	1
all	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
indefiniteness	1
left	1
by	1
their	1
conversation	1
had	1
slipped	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
now	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
anyhow	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
blissful	1
interview	1
awaiting	1
him	1
that	1
night	1
flashed	1
across	1
his	1
imagination	1
like	1
a	1
flaming	1
light	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
race	1
gained	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
drove	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
into	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
the	1
races	1
overtaking	1
carriages	1
driving	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
summer	1
villas	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
petersburg	1
at	1
his	1
quarters	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
left	1
at	1
home	1
all	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
and	1
his	1
valet	1
was	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
changing	1
his	1
clothes	1
his	1
valet	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
second	1
race	1
had	1
begun	1
already	1
that	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
boy	1
had	1
twice	1
run	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
stables	1
dressing	1
without	1
hurry	1
he	1
never	1
hurried	1
himself	1
and	1
never	1
lost	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1
vronsky	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
sheds	1
from	1
the	1
sheds	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
perfect	1
sea	1
of	1
carriages	1
and	1
people	1
on	1
foot	1
soldiers	1
surrounding	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
and	1
pavilions	1
swarming	1
with	1
people	1
the	1
second	1
race	1
was	1
apparently	1
going	1
on	1
for	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sheds	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
bell	1
ringing	1
going	1
towards	1
the	1
stable	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
white	1
legged	1
chestnut	1
mahotin	1
s	1
gladiator	1
being	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
forage	1
horsecloth	1
with	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
huge	1
ears	1
edged	1
with	1
blue	1
where	1
s	1
cord	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
stable	1

on	1
the	1

all	1

said	1
the	1
englishman	1
don	1
t	1
upset	1
yourself	1
vronsky	1
once	1
more	1
took	1
in	1
in	1
one	1
glance	1
the	1
exquisite	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
favorite	1
mare	1
who	1
was	1
quivering	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
he	1
tore	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stable	1
he	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
pavilions	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
moment	1
for	1
escaping	1
attention	1
the	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
race	1
was	1
just	1
finishing	1
and	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
horse	1
guard	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
hussar	1
behind	1
urging	1
their	1
horses	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
last	1
effort	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
winning	1
post	1
from	1
the	1
center	1
and	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
ring	1
all	1
were	1
crowding	1
to	1
the	1
winning	1
post	1
and	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
guards	1
were	1
shouting	1
loudly	1
their	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
expected	1
triumph	1
of	1
their	1
officer	1
and	1
comrade	1
vronsky	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
unnoticed	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
bell	1
rang	1
at	1
the	1
finish	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
mudspattered	1
horse	1
guard	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
first	1
bending	1
over	1
the	1
saddle	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
his	1
panting	1
gray	1
horse	1
that	1
looked	1
dark	1
with	1
sweat	1
the	1
horse	1
stiffening	1
out	1
its	1
legs	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
stopped	1
its	1
rapid	1
course	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
guards	1
looked	1
round	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
waking	1
up	1
from	1
a	1
heavy	1
sleep	1
and	1
just	1
managed	1
to	1
smile	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
friends	1
and	1
outsiders	1
pressed	1
round	1
him	1
vronsky	1
intentionally	1
avoided	1
that	1
select	1
crowd	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
world	1
which	1
was	1
moving	1
and	1
talking	1
with	1
discreet	1
freedom	1
before	1
the	1
pavilions	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
madame	1
karenina	1
was	1
there	1
and	1
betsy	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wife	1
and	1
he	1
purposely	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
near	1
them	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
something	1
distracting	1
his	1
attention	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
met	1
and	1
stopped	1
by	1
acquaintances	1
who	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
previous	1
races	1
and	1
kept	1
asking	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
late	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
racers	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
pavilion	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
prizes	1
and	1
all	1
attention	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
that	1
point	1
vronsky	1
s	1
elder	1
brother	1
alexander	1
a	1
colonel	1
with	1
heavy	1
fringed	1
epaulets	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
tall	1
though	1
as	1
broadly	1
built	1
as	1
alexey	1
and	1
handsomer	1
and	1
rosier	1
than	1
he	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
red	1
nose	1
and	1
an	1
open	1
drunken	1
looking	1
face	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
my	1

of	1
the	1
dissolute	1
life	1
and	1
in	1
especial	1
the	1
drunken	1
habits	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
notorious	1
was	1
quite	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
circle	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
a	1
matter	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
might	1
be	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
kept	1
a	1
smiling	1
countenance	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
jesting	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
about	1
something	1
of	1
little	1
moment	1

rarely	1
with	1
him	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
warm	1
heart	1
he	1
was	1
seldom	1

when	1

was	1
angry	1

when	1

quivered	1
then	1
as	1

away	1
from	1

after	1

the	1
close	1

out	1

it	1

be	1
seen	1
that	1

approaching	1
the	1

in	1
twos	1

threes	1

one	1
behind	1

to	1
the	1
spectators	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
started	1
simultaneously	1

to	1
the	1
racers	1
there	1
were	1
seconds	1

had	1
great	1
value	1
to	1

had	1
lost	1
the	1
first	1

the	1
stream	1
vronsky	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
in	1
the	1
mare	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
force	1
as	1
she	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1

moving	1
lightly	1

rhythmically	1
up	1

down	1
exactly	1
in	1

of	1
vronsky	1

in	1
front	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
dainty	1
mare	1

bearing	1
kuzovlev	1
more	1
dead	1
than	1
alive	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
vronsky	1
was	1
not	1
master	1
either	1
of	1
himself	1
or	1
his	1
mare	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
obstacle	1
the	1
stream	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
guide	1
the	1
motions	1
of	1
his	1
mare	1
gladiator	1
and	1
diana	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
together	1
and	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
simultaneously	1
they	1
rose	1
above	1
the	1
stream	1
and	1
flew	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
frou	1
frou	1
darted	1
after	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
flying	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
vronsky	1
felt	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
he	1
suddenly	1
saw	1
almost	1
under	1
his	1
mare	1
s	1
hoofs	1
kuzovlev	1
who	1
was	1
floundering	1
with	1
diana	1
on	1
the	1
further	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
kuzovlev	1
had	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
reins	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
leap	1
and	1
the	1
mare	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
flying	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
those	1
details	1
vronsky	1
learned	1
later	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
all	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
that	1
just	1
under	1
him	1
where	1
frou	1
frou	1
must	1
alight	1
diana	1
s	1
legs	1
or	1
head	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
but	1
frou	1
frou	1
drew	1
up	1
her	1
legs	1
and	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
leaping	1
like	1
a	1
falling	1
cat	1
and	1
clearing	1
the	1
other	1
mare	1
alighted	1
beyond	1
her	1
o	1
the	1
darling	1
thought	1
vronsky	1
after	1
crossing	1
the	1
stream	1
vronsky	1
had	1
complete	1
control	1
of	1
his	1
mare	1
and	1
began	1
holding	1
her	1
in	1
intending	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
great	1
barrier	1
behind	1
mahotin	1
and	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
overtake	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
ground	1
of	1
about	1
five	1
hundred	1
yards	1
that	1
followed	1
it	1
the	1
great	1
barrier	1
stood	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
imperial	1
pavilion	1
the	1
tsar	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
court	1
and	1
crowds	1
of	1
people	1
were	1
all	1
gazing	1
at	1
them	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
mahotin	1
a	1
length	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
devil	1
as	1
the	1
solid	1
barrier	1
was	1
called	1
vronsky	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
those	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
upon	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
except	1
the	1
ears	1
and	1
neck	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
mare	1
the	1
ground	1
racing	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
back	1
and	1
white	1
legs	1
of	1
gladiator	1
beating	1
time	1
swiftly	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
keeping	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
distance	1
ahead	1
gladiator	1
rose	1
with	1
no	1
sound	1
of	1
knocking	1
against	1
anything	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
his	1
short	1
tail	1
he	1
disappeared	1
from	1
vronsky	1
s	1
sight	1
bravo	1
cried	1
a	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
under	1
vronsky	1
s	1
eyes	1
right	1
before	1
him	1
flashed	1
the	1
palings	1
of	1
the	1
barrier	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
action	1
his	1
mare	1
flew	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
palings	1
vanished	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
only	1
a	1
crash	1
behind	1
him	1
the	1
mare	1
excited	1
by	1
gladiator	1
s	1
keeping	1
ahead	1
had	1
risen	1
too	1
soon	1
before	1
the	1
barrier	1
and	1
grazed	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
hind	1
hoofs	1
but	1
her	1
pace	1
never	1
changed	1
and	1
vronsky	1
feeling	1
a	1
spatter	1
of	1
mud	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
same	1
distance	1
from	1
gladiator	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
perceived	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
back	1
and	1
short	1
tail	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
same	1
swiftly	1
moving	1
white	1
legs	1
that	1
got	1
no	1
further	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
vronsky	1
thought	1
that	1
now	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
overtake	1
mahotin	1
frou	1
frou	1
herself	1
understanding	1
his	1
thoughts	1
without	1
any	1
incitement	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
gained	1
ground	1
considerably	1
and	1
began	1
getting	1
alongside	1
of	1
mahotin	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
side	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
inner	1
cord	1
mahotin	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
pass	1
that	1
side	1
vronsky	1
had	1
hardly	1
formed	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
perhaps	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
side	1
when	1
frou	1
frou	1
shifted	1
her	1
pace	1
and	1
began	1
overtaking	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
frou	1
frou	1
s	1
shoulder	1
beginning	1
by	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
dark	1
with	1
sweat	1
was	1
even	1
with	1
gladiator	1
s	1
back	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
lengths	1
they	1
moved	1
evenly	1
but	1
before	1
the	1
obstacle	1
they	1
were	1
approaching	1
vronsky	1
began	1
working	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid	1
having	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
outer	1
circle	1
and	1
swiftly	1
passed	1
mahotin	1
just	1
upon	1
the	1
declivity	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
his	1
mud	1
stained	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
flashed	1
by	1
he	1
even	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
smiled	1
vronsky	1
passed	1
mahotin	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
immediately	1
aware	1
of	1
him	1
close	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
ceased	1
hearing	1
the	1
even	1
thudding	1
hoofs	1
and	1
the	1
rapid	1
and	1
still	1
quite	1
fresh	1
breathing	1
of	1
gladiator	1
the	1
next	1
two	1
obstacles	1
the	1
water	1
course	1
and	1
the	1
barrier	1
were	1
easily	1
crossed	1
but	1
vronsky	1
began	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
snorting	1
and	1
thud	1
of	1
gladiator	1
closer	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
urged	1
on	1
his	1
mare	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
delight	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
easily	1
quickened	1
her	1
pace	1
and	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
gladiator	1
s	1
hoofs	1
was	1
again	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
distance	1
away	1
vronsky	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
as	1
cord	1
had	1
advised	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
winner	1
his	1
excitement	1
his	1
delight	1
and	1
his	1
tenderness	1
for	1
frou	1
frou	1
grew	1
keener	1
and	1
keener	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
again	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
do	1
this	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
cool	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
urge	1
on	1
his	1
mare	1
so	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
same	1
reserve	1
of	1
force	1
in	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
gladiator	1
still	1
kept	1
there	1
remained	1
only	1
one	1
obstacle	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
cross	1
it	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
in	1
first	1
he	1
was	1
flying	1
towards	1
the	1
irish	1
barricade	1
frou	1
frou	1
and	1
he	1
both	1
together	1
saw	1
the	1
barricade	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
and	1
both	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
mare	1
had	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
hesitation	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
uncertainty	1
in	1
the	1
mare	1
s	1
ears	1
and	1
lifted	1
the	1
whip	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
fears	1
were	1
groundless	1
the	1
mare	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
wanted	1
she	1
quickened	1
her	1
pace	1
and	1
rose	1
smoothly	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
fancied	1
she	1
would	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
ground	1
gave	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
her	1
rush	1
which	1
carried	1
her	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
ditch	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
rhythm	1
without	1
effort	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
leg	1
forward	1
frou	1
frou	1
fell	1
back	1
into	1
her	1
pace	1
again	1
bravo	1
vronsky	1
he	1
heard	1
shouts	1
from	1
a	1
knot	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
knew	1
they	1
were	1
his	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
who	1
were	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
obstacle	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
recognize	1
yashvin	1
s	1
voice	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
o	1
my	1
sweet	1
he	1
said	1
inwardly	1
to	1
frou	1
frou	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
behind	1
he	1
s	1
cleared	1
it	1
he	1
thought	1
catching	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
gladiator	1
s	1
hoofs	1
behind	1
him	1
there	1
remained	1
only	1
the	1
last	1
ditch	1
filled	1
with	1
water	1
and	1
five	1
feet	1
wide	1
vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
but	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
first	1
began	1
sawing	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
lifting	1
the	1
mare	1
s	1
head	1
and	1
letting	1
it	1
go	1
in	1
time	1
with	1
her	1
paces	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
mare	1
was	1
at	1
her	1
very	1
last	1
reserve	1
of	1
strength	1
not	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1
merely	1
were	1
wet	1
but	1
the	1
sweat	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
drops	1
on	1
her	1
mane	1
her	1
head	1
her	1
sharp	1
ears	1
and	1
her	1
breath	1
came	1
in	1
short	1
sharp	1
gasps	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
strength	1
left	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
remaining	1
five	1
hundred	1
yards	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
from	1
feeling	1
himself	1
nearer	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
peculiar	1
smoothness	1
of	1
his	1
motion	1
that	1
vronsky	1
knew	1
how	1
greatly	1
the	1
mare	1
had	1
quickened	1
her	1
pace	1
she	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
ditch	1
as	1
though	1
not	1
noticing	1
it	1
she	1
flew	1
over	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
vronsky	1
to	1
his	1
horror	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
failed	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
mare	1
s	1
pace	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
made	1
a	1
fearful	1
unpardonable	1
mistake	1
in	1
recovering	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
position	1
had	1
shifted	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
something	1
awful	1
had	1
happened	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
yet	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
when	1
the	1
white	1
legs	1
of	1
a	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
flashed	1
by	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
mahotin	1
passed	1
at	1
a	1
swift	1
gallop	1
vronsky	1
was	1
touching	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
his	1
mare	1
was	1
sinking	1
on	1
that	1
foot	1
he	1
just	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
free	1
his	1
leg	1
when	1
she	1
fell	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
gasping	1
painfully	1
and	1
making	1
vain	1
efforts	1
to	1
rise	1
with	1
her	1
delicate	1
soaking	1
neck	1
she	1
fluttered	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
a	1
shot	1
bird	1
the	1
clumsy	1
movement	1
made	1
by	1
vronsky	1
had	1
broken	1
her	1
back	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
knew	1
much	1
later	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
knew	1
only	1
that	1
mahotin	1
had	1
flown	1
swiftly	1
by	1
while	1
he	1
stood	1
staggering	1
alone	1
on	1
the	1
muddy	1
motionless	1
ground	1
and	1
frou	1
frou	1
lay	1
gasping	1
before	1
him	1
bending	1
her	1
head	1
back	1
and	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
exquisite	1
eyes	1
still	1
unable	1
to	1

what	1
had	1
happened	1
vronsky	1
tugged	1
at	1
his	1
mare	1

all	1
over	1
like	1
a	1
fish	1

her	1
shoulders	1
setting	1
the	1

heaving	1
she	1
rose	1
on	1
her	1
front	1
legs	1

unable	1
to	1
lift	1
her	1
back	1
she	1
quivered	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
again	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
hideous	1
with	1
passion	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw	1
trembling	1
and	1
his	1
cheeks	1
white	1
vronsky	1
kicked	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
heel	1
in	1
the	1
stomach	1
and	1
again	1
fell	1
to	1
tugging	1
at	1
the	1

did	1
not	1
stir	1

thrusting	1
her	1

into	1

whole	1

unhurt	1

half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
vronsky	1
had	1
regained	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1

the	1
memory	1
of	1
that	1
race	1
remained	1
for	1
long	1
in	1

cruelest	1

bitterest	1
memory	1

chapter	1

the	1
external	1
relations	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
remained	1
unchanged	1
the	1
sole	1
difference	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
busily	1
occupied	1
than	1
ever	1
as	1
in	1
former	1
years	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
spring	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
foreign	1
watering	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
health	1
deranged	1
by	1
the	1
winter	1
s	1
work	1
that	1
every	1
year	1
grew	1
heavier	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
always	1
he	1
returned	1
in	1
july	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
fell	1
to	1
work	1
as	1
usual	1
with	1
increased	1
energy	1
as	1
usual	1
too	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
moved	1
for	1
the	1
summer	1
to	1
a	1
villa	1
out	1
of	1
town	1
while	1
he	1
remained	1
in	1
petersburg	1
from	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
after	1
the	1
party	1
at	1
princess	1
tverskaya	1
s	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
spoken	1
again	1
to	1
anna	1
of	1
his	1
suspicions	1
and	1
his	1
jealousies	1
and	1
that	1
habitual	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
bantering	1
mimicry	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
convenient	1
tone	1
possible	1
for	1
his	1
present	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
colder	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
simply	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
slightly	1
displeased	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
that	1
first	1
midnight	1
conversation	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
repelled	1
in	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
her	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
vexation	1
but	1
nothing	1
more	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
open	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
mentally	1
addressing	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you	1
now	1
you	1
may	1
beg	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
but	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
open	1
with	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
mentally	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
after	1
vainly	1
attempting	1
to	1
extinguish	1
a	1
fire	1
should	1
fly	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
with	1
his	1
vain	1
efforts	1
and	1
say	1
oh	1
very	1
well	1
then	1
you	1
shall	1
burn	1
for	1
this	1
this	1
man	1
so	1
subtle	1
and	1
astute	1
in	1
official	1
life	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
all	1
the	1
senselessness	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
it	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
terrible	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
realize	1
his	1
actual	1
position	1
and	1
he	1
shut	1
down	1
and	1
locked	1
and	1
sealed	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
secret	1
place	1
where	1
lay	1
hid	1
his	1
feelings	1
towards	1
his	1
family	1
that	1
is	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
son	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
careful	1
father	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
winter	1
become	1
peculiarly	1
frigid	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
adopted	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
bantering	1
tone	1
he	1
used	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
aha	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
greeting	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
met	1
him	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
asserted	1
and	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
in	1
any	1
previous	1
year	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
official	1
business	1
as	1
that	1
year	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
sought	1
work	1
for	1
himself	1
that	1
year	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
for	1
keeping	1
shut	1
that	1
secret	1
place	1
where	1
lay	1
hid	1
his	1
feelings	1
towards	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
about	1
them	1
which	1
became	1
more	1
terrible	1
the	1
longer	1
they	1
lay	1
there	1
if	1
anyone	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
ask	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
behavior	1
the	1
mild	1
and	1
peaceable	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
greatly	1
angered	1
with	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
should	1
question	1
him	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
there	1
positively	1
came	1
into	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
face	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
haughtiness	1
and	1
severity	1
whenever	1
anyone	1
inquired	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
health	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
at	1
all	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
behavior	1
and	1
he	1
actually	1
succeeded	1
in	1
not	1
thinking	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
all	1

permanent	1

and	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1

at	1
the	1

of	1

close	1
intimacy	1
with	1

vronsky	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
sternly	1
cut	1
her	1
short	1
roundly	1
declaring	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
be	1
above	1
suspicion	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
began	1
to	1
avoid	1

lidia	1
ivanovna	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
many	1
people	1
in	1
society	1
cast	1
dubious	1
glances	1
on	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
so	1
particularly	1
insisted	1
on	1
staying	1
at	1
tsarskoe	1
where	1
betsy	1
was	1
staying	1
and	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
vronsky	1

regiment	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
though	1
he	1
never	1
admitted	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
proofs	1
not	1
even	1
suspicious	1
evidence	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
knew	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
deceived	1
husband	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
profoundly	1
miserable	1
about	1
it	1
how	1
often	1
during	1
those	1
eight	1
years	1
of	1
happy	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
other	1
men	1
s	1
faithless	1
wives	1
and	1
other	1
deceived	1
husbands	1
and	1
asked	1
himself	1
how	1
can	1
people	1
descend	1
to	1
that	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
hideous	1
position	1
but	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
misfortune	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
himself	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
thinking	1
of	1
putting	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
position	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
recognize	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
would	1
not	1
recognize	1
it	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
awful	1
too	1
unnatural	1
since	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
abroad	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
twice	1
been	1
at	1
their	1
country	1
villa	1
once	1
he	1
dined	1
there	1
another	1
time	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
there	1
with	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
friends	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
stayed	1
the	1
night	1
there	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
habit	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
previous	1
years	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
races	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
busy	1
day	1
for	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
but	1
when	1
mentally	1
sketching	1
out	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
their	1
country	1
house	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
immediately	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
races	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
court	1
were	1
to	1
witness	1
and	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
once	1
a	1
week	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
appearances	1
and	1
besides	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
wife	1
some	1
money	1
for	1
her	1
expenses	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
usual	1
arrangement	1
with	1
his	1
habitual	1
control	1
over	1
his	1
thoughts	1
though	1
he	1
thought	1
all	1
this	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
his	1
thoughts	1
stray	1
further	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
morning	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
full	1
one	1
for	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
the	1
evening	1
before	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
pamphlet	1
by	1
a	1
celebrated	1
traveler	1
in	1
china	1
who	1
was	1
staying	1
in	1
petersburg	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
she	1
enclosed	1
a	1
note	1
begging	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
traveler	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
extremely	1
interesting	1
person	1
from	1
various	1
points	1
of	1
view	1
and	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
useful	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
pamphlet	1
through	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
finished	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
then	1
people	1
began	1
arriving	1
with	1
petitions	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
the	1
reports	1
interviews	1
appointments	1
dismissals	1
apportionment	1
of	1
rewards	1
pensions	1
grants	1
notes	1
the	1
workaday	1
round	1
as	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
called	1
it	1
that	1
always	1
took	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
private	1
business	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
a	1
visit	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
who	1
managed	1
his	1
property	1
the	1
steward	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
much	1
time	1
he	1
simply	1
gave	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
needed	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
brief	1
statement	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
his	1
affairs	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
altogether	1
satisfactory	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
happened	1
that	1
during	1
that	1
year	1
owing	1
to	1
increased	1
expenses	1
more	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
out	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deficit	1
but	1
the	1
doctor	1
a	1
celebrated	1
petersburg	1
doctor	1
who	1
was	1
an	1
intimate	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
time	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
him	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
was	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
visit	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
when	1
the	1
doctor	1
questioned	1
him	1
very	1
carefully	1
about	1
his	1
health	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
breathing	1
and	1
tapped	1
at	1
his	1
liver	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
friend	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
usual	1
that	1
year	1
had	1
begged	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
examine	1
him	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
the	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
russia	1
countess	1
replied	1
the	1
doctor	1
a	1
priceless	1
man	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
extremely	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
liver	1
considerably	1
enlarged	1
and	1
the	1
digestive	1
powers	1
weakened	1
while	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
mineral	1
waters	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
without	1
effect	1
he	1
prescribed	1
more	1
physical	1
exercise	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
less	1
mental	1
strain	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
no	1
worry	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
power	1
as	1
abstaining	1
from	1
breathing	1
then	1
he	1
withdrew	1
leaving	1
in	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
sense	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
wrong	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
curing	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
away	1
the	1
doctor	1
chanced	1
to	1
meet	1
on	1
the	1
staircase	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
his	1
sludin	1
who	1
was	1
secretary	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
department	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
comrades	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
rarely	1
met	1
they	1
thought	1
highly	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
were	1
excellent	1
friends	1
and	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
doctor	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
his	1
opinion	1
of	1
a	1
patient	1
so	1
freely	1
as	1
to	1
sludin	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
seeing	1
him	1
said	1
sludin	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
well	1
and	1
i	1
fancy	1
well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
beckoning	1
over	1
sludin	1
s	1
head	1
to	1
his	1
coachman	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
carriage	1
round	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
this	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
taking	1
a	1
finger	1
of	1
his	1
kid	1
glove	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
hands	1
and	1
pulling	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
strain	1
the	1
strings	1
and	1
then	1
try	1
to	1
break	1
them	1
you	1
ll	1
find	1
it	1
a	1
difficult	1
job	1
but	1
strain	1
a	1
string	1
to	1
its	1
very	1
utmost	1
and	1
the	1
mere	1
weight	1
of	1
one	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
strained	1
string	1
will	1
snap	1
it	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
close	1
assiduity	1
his	1
conscientious	1
devotion	1
to	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
s	1
strained	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
some	1
outside	1
burden	1
weighing	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
light	1
one	1
concluded	1
the	1
doctor	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
significantly	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
he	1
added	1
as	1
he	1
sank	1
into	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
yes	1
yes	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
does	1
waste	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
doctor	1
responded	1
vaguely	1
to	1
some	1
reply	1
of	1
sludin	1
s	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
caught	1
directly	1
after	1
the	1
doctor	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
came	1
the	1
celebrated	1
traveler	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
pamphlet	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
finished	1
reading	1
and	1
his	1
previous	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
subject	1
impressed	1
the	1
traveler	1
by	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
and	1
enlightenment	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
traveler	1
there	1
was	1
announced	1
a	1
provincial	1
marshal	1
of	1
nobility	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
petersburg	1
with	1
whom	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
conversation	1
after	1
his	1
departure	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
daily	1
routine	1
of	1
business	1
with	1
his	1
secretary	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
still	1
had	1
to	1
drive	1
round	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
great	1
personage	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
grave	1
and	1
serious	1
import	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
only	1
just	1
managed	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
by	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
his	1
dinner	1
hour	1
and	1
after	1
dining	1
with	1
his	1
secretary	1
he	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
drive	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
villa	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
races	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
always	1
tried	1
nowadays	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
third	1
person	1
in	1
his	1
interviews	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
chapter	1
27	1
anna	1
was	1
upstairs	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
with	1
annushka	1
s	1
assistance	1
pinning	1
the	1
last	1
ribbon	1
on	1
her	1
gown	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
crunching	1
the	1
gravel	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
it	1
s	1
too	1
early	1
for	1
betsy	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
glancing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
hat	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
the	1
ears	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
sticking	1
up	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
how	1
unlucky	1
can	1
he	1
be	1
going	1
to	1
stay	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
wondered	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
might	1
come	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
chance	1
struck	1
her	1
as	1
so	1
awful	1
and	1
terrible	1
that	1
without	1
dwelling	1
on	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
and	1
radiant	1
face	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
that	1
spirit	1
of	1
falsehood	1
and	1
deceit	1
in	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
late	1
she	1
abandoned	1
herself	1
to	1
that	1
spirit	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
hardly	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
ah	1
how	1
nice	1
of	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
giving	1
her	1
husband	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
greeting	1
sludin	1
who	1
was	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
you	1
re	1
staying	1
the	1
night	1
i	1
hope	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
word	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
falsehood	1
prompted	1
her	1
to	1
utter	1
and	1
now	1
we	1

said	1
turning	1
first	1
to	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
spoke	1
very	1
simply	1
and	1
naturally	1
but	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
too	1
fast	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
from	1
noticing	1
in	1
the	1
inquisitive	1
look	1
mihail	1

turned	1
on	1
her	1
that	1

an	1
hour	1
of	1
my	1
time	1

that	1
someone	1
of	1
our	1
friends	1
must	1
have	1
sent	1
him	1
my	1
health	1

so	1
precious	1
it	1
seems	1

what	1
did	1
he	1

she	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
health	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
rest	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
all	1
this	1

rapidly	1
and	1
with	1

alexey	1

did	1
not	1
now	1
attach	1
any	1
special	1
significance	1
to	1
this	1
tone	1
of	1
hers	1
he	1
heard	1
only	1
her	1
words	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
only	1
the	1
direct	1
sense	1
they	1
bore	1
and	1
he	1
answered	1
simply	1
though	1
jestingly	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
remarkable	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
conversation	1
but	1
never	1
after	1
could	1

recall	1
this	1
brief	1
scene	1
without	1
an	1
agonizing	1
pang	1
of	1
shame	1
seryozha	1
came	1
in	1
preceded	1
by	1
his	1
governess	1
if	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
observe	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
noticed	1
the	1
timid	1
and	1
bewildered	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
seryozha	1
glanced	1
first	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
his	1
mother	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
anything	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it	1
ah	1

been	1
shy	1
of	1

ever	1

had	1
taken	1
to	1
calling	1
him	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
since	1
that	1
insoluble	1
question	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
whether	1
vronsky	1
were	1
a	1
friend	1
or	1
a	1
foe	1
he	1
avoided	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
towards	1
his	1
mother	1
as	1
though	1
seeking	1
shelter	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
ease	1
meanwhile	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
holding	1
his	1
son	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
governess	1

was	1
so	1
miserably	1
uncomfortable	1

off	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
moving	1

watched	1
his	1
progress	1
towards	1
the	1

him	1
now	1
responding	1
condescendingly	1
to	1
an	1
ingratiating	1
bow	1
now	1
exchanging	1
friendly	1
nonchalant	1

with	1
his	1

trying	1
to	1

the	1

of	1
some	1

of	1
this	1

and	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1

to	1
get	1
on	1
that	1

all	1
there	1

they	1
are	1

so	1
many	1

his	1

he	1
was	1
staring	1
straight	1
at	1

did	1
not	1

his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
muslin	1
ribbons	1
feathers	1
parasols	1
and	1
flowers	1
she	1

that	1

he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1

smiled	1
to	1
his	1

as	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
smile	1
on	1
meeting	1
his	1
wife	1
after	1
only	1
just	1
parting	1
from	1

greeted	1

what	1
was	1
due	1
that	1

out	1

among	1
the	1

the	1

was	1
standing	1
an	1

alexey	1

a	1
high	1
opinion	1
noted	1
for	1
his	1
intelligence	1

culture	1
alexey	1

entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
interval	1
between	1
the	1
races	1
and	1
so	1
nothing	1
hindered	1

the	1

expressed	1
his	1
disapproval	1
of	1

anna	1
heard	1
his	1
high	1
measured	1
tones	1
not	1
losing	1
one	1
word	1
and	1
every	1
word	1
struck	1
her	1
as	1
false	1
and	1
stabbed	1
her	1
ears	1
with	1
pain	1
when	1
the	1
three	1
mile	1
steeplechase	1
was	1
beginning	1
she	1
bent	1
forward	1
and	1
gazed	1
with	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
at	1
vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
mounted	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
loathsome	1
never	1
ceasing	1
voice	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
terror	1
for	1
vronsky	1
but	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
agony	1
was	1
the	1
never	1
ceasing	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
stream	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
peculiar	1
loquacity	1
that	1
day	1
so	1
exasperating	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
merely	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
inward	1
distress	1
and	1
uneasiness	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
that	1

to	1
drown	1
the	1
pain	1
in	1
the	1

way	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
needed	1
mental	1
exercise	1
to	1
drown	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1

her	1

in	1
vronsky	1

with	1
the	1
continual	1
iteration	1
of	1
his	1
name	1
would	1
force	1
themselves	1
on	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
natural	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
well	1
and	1
cleverly	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
natural	1

an	1

element	1
in	1

can	1
point	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
brilliant	1
feats	1
of	1
cavalry	1
in	1
military	1
history	1
it	1
is	1
simply	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
historically	1
developed	1
this	1
force	1
both	1
in	1

in	1

in	1
my	1

again	1
to	1
the	1

he	1
was	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
paused	1
while	1
there	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
began	1
again	1
directly	1
i	1
admit	1
that	1
manly	1
sports	1
do	1
not	1
he	1
was	1
continuing	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
racers	1
started	1
and	1
all	1
conversation	1
ceased	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
too	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
everyone	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
turned	1
towards	1
the	1
stream	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
took	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
race	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
watch	1
the	1
racers	1
but	1
fell	1
listlessly	1
to	1
scanning	1
the	1
spectators	1
with	1
his	1
weary	1
eyes	1
his	1
eyes	1
rested	1
upon	1
anna	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
white	1
and	1
set	1
she	1
was	1
obviously	1
seeing	1
nothing	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
one	1
man	1
her	1
hand	1
had	1
convulsively	1
clutched	1
her	1
fan	1
and	1
she	1
held	1
her	1
breath	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
hastily	1
turned	1
away	1
scrutinizing	1
other	1
faces	1
but	1
here	1
s	1
this	1
lady	1
too	1
and	1
others	1
very	1
much	1
moved	1
as	1
well	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
natural	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
told	1
himself	1
he	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
drawn	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
examined	1
that	1
face	1
again	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
read	1
what	1
was	1
so	1
plainly	1
written	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
with	1
horror	1
read	1
on	1
it	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
first	1
fall	1
kuzovlev	1
s	1
at	1
the	1
stream	1
agitated	1
everyone	1
but	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
distinctly	1
on	1
anna	1
s	1
pale	1
triumphant	1
face	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
was	1
watching	1
had	1
not	1
fallen	1
when	1
after	1
mahotin	1
and	1
vronsky	1
had	1
cleared	1
the	1
worst	1
barrier	1
the	1
next	1
officer	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
straight	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
fatally	1
injured	1
and	1
a	1
shudder	1
of	1
horror	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
public	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
notice	1
it	1
and	1
had	1
some	1
difficulty	1
in	1
realizing	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
about	1
her	1
but	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
and	1
with	1
greater	1
persistence	1
he	1
watched	1
her	1
anna	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
race	1
became	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
cold	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
she	1
glanced	1
round	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
frown	1
turned	1
away	1
again	1
ah	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
glance	1
at	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
race	1
was	1
an	1
unlucky	1
one	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
seventeen	1
officers	1
who	1
rode	1
in	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
were	1
thrown	1
and	1
hurt	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
everyone	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
agitation	1
which	1
was	1
intensified	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
tsar	1
was	1
displeased	1
chapter	1
29	1
everyone	1
was	1
loudly	1
expressing	1
disapprobation	1
everyone	1
was	1
repeating	1
a	1
phrase	1
someone	1
had	1
uttered	1
the	1
lions	1
and	1
gladiators	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
next	1
thing	1
and	1
everyone	1
was	1
feeling	1
horrified	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
vronsky	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
anna	1
moaned	1
aloud	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
very	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
afterwards	1
a	1
change	1
came	1
over	1
anna	1
s	1
face	1
which	1
really	1
was	1
beyond	1
decorum	1
she	1
utterly	1
lost	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
began	1
fluttering	1
like	1
a	1
caged	1
bird	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
turned	1
to	1
betsy	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
betsy	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
bending	1
down	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
anna	1
and	1
courteously	1
offered	1
her	1
his	1
arm	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
french	1
but	1
anna	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
her	1
husband	1
he	1
s	1
broken	1
his	1
leg	1
too	1
so	1
they	1
say	1
the	1
general	1
was	1
saying	1
this	1
is	1
beyond	1
everything	1
without	1
answering	1
her	1
husband	1
anna	1
lifted	1
her	1
opera	1
glass	1
and	1
gazed	1
towards	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
vronsky	1
had	1
fallen	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
off	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
people	1
about	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
nothing	1
she	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
opera	1
glass	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
moved	1
away	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
an	1
officer	1
galloped	1
up	1
and	1
made	1
some	1
announcement	1
to	1
the	1
tsar	1
anna	1
craned	1
forward	1
listening	1
stiva	1
stiva	1
she	1
cried	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
but	1
her	1
brother	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
again	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
moved	1
away	1
once	1
more	1
i	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
arm	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
going	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
reaching	1
towards	1
her	1
hand	1
she	1
drew	1
back	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
aversion	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
answered	1
no	1
no	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
i	1
ll	1
stay	1
she	1
saw	1
now	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
vronsky	1
s	1
accident	1
an	1
officer	1
was	1
running	1
across	1
the	1
course	1
towards	1
the	1
pavilion	1
betsy	1
waved	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
officer	1
brought	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
rider	1
was	1
not	1
killed	1
but	1
the	1
horse	1
had	1
broken	1
its	1
back	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
anna	1
sat	1
down	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
fan	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
weeping	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
her	1
tears	1
nor	1
even	1
the	1
sobs	1
that	1
were	1
shaking	1
her	1
bosom	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
stood	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
screen	1
her	1
giving	1
her	1
time	1
to	1
recover	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
i	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
arm	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
time	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
anna	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
princess	1
betsy	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
rescue	1
no	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
i	1
brought	1
anna	1
and	1
i	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
home	1
put	1
in	1
betsy	1
excuse	1
me	1
princess	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
courteously	1
but	1
looking	1
her	1
very	1
firmly	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
but	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
anna	1
s	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
i	1
wish	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
home	1
with	1
me	1
anna	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
way	1
got	1
up	1
submissively	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
arm	1
i	1
ll	1
send	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
and	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
betsy	1
whispered	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
pavilion	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
as	1
always	1
talked	1
to	1
those	1
he	1
met	1
and	1
anna	1
had	1
as	1
always	1
to	1
talk	1
and	1
answer	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
utterly	1
beside	1
herself	1
and	1
moved	1
hanging	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
arm	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
is	1
he	1
killed	1
or	1
not	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
will	1
he	1
come	1
or	1
not	1
shall	1
i	1
see	1
him	1
today	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
seat	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
carriage	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
drove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
carriages	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
consider	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
real	1
condition	1
he	1
merely	1
saw	1
the	1
outward	1
symptoms	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
behaving	1
unbecomingly	1
and	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
so	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
difficult	1
for	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
behaved	1
unbecomingly	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
something	1
utterly	1
different	1
what	1
an	1
inclination	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
though	1
for	1
these	1
cruel	1
spectacles	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
observe	1
eh	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
said	1
anna	1
contemptuously	1
he	1
was	1
offended	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
i	1
am	1
obliged	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
began	1
so	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
out	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
frightened	1
i	1
am	1
obliged	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
behavior	1
has	1
been	1
unbecoming	1
today	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
french	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
has	1
my	1
behavior	1
been	1
unbecoming	1
she	1
said	1
aloud	1
turning	1
her	1
head	1
swiftly	1
and	1
looking	1
him	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
bright	1
expression	1
that	1
seemed	1
covering	1
something	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
determination	1
under	1
which	1
she	1
concealed	1
with	1
difficulty	1
the	1
dismay	1
she	1
was	1
feeling	1
mind	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
window	1
opposite	1
the	1
coachman	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
pulled	1
up	1
the	1
window	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
consider	1
unbecoming	1
she	1
repeated	1
the	1
despair	1
you	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
conceal	1
at	1
the	1
accident	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
riders	1
he	1
waited	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
answer	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
her	1
i	1
have	1
already	1
begged	1
you	1
so	1
to	1
conduct	1
yourself	1
in	1
society	1
that	1
even	1
malicious	1
tongues	1
can	1
find	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
you	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
i	1
spoke	1
of	1
your	1
inward	1
attitude	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
that	1
now	1
now	1
i	1
speak	1
only	1
of	1
your	1
external	1
attitude	1
you	1
have	1
behaved	1
improperly	1
and	1
i	1
would	1
wish	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
occur	1
again	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
she	1
felt	1
panic	1
stricken	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
thinking	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
vronsky	1
was	1
not	1
killed	1
was	1
it	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
were	1
speaking	1
when	1
they	1
said	1
the	1
rider	1
was	1
unhurt	1
but	1
the	1
horse	1
had	1
broken	1
its	1
back	1
she	1
merely	1
smiled	1
with	1
a	1
pretense	1
of	1
irony	1
when	1
he	1
finished	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
speak	1
boldly	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
realized	1
plainly	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
dismay	1
she	1
was	1
feeling	1
infected	1
him	1
too	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
smile	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
misapprehension	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
she	1
is	1
smiling	1
at	1
my	1
suspicions	1
yes	1
she	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
directly	1
what	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
before	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
foundation	1
for	1
my	1
suspicions	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
absurd	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
everything	1
was	1
hanging	1
over	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
he	1
expected	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
answer	1
mockingly	1
as	1
before	1
that	1
his	1
suspicions	1
were	1
absurd	1
and	1
utterly	1
groundless	1
so	1
terrible	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
anything	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
scared	1
and	1
gloomy	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
promise	1
even	1
deception	1
possibly	1
i	1
was	1
mistaken	1
said	1
he	1
if	1
so	1
i	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
no	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
mistaken	1
she	1
said	1
deliberately	1
looking	1
desperately	1
into	1
his	1
cold	1
face	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
mistaken	1
i	1
was	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
in	1
despair	1
i	1
hear	1
you	1

dropping	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
corner	1

she	1
broke	1
into	1
sobs	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
stir	1
and	1
kept	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
but	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
suddenly	1
bore	1
the	1
solemn	1
rigidity	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
his	1
expression	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
drive	1
home	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
her	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
i	1
expect	1
a	1
strict	1
observance	1
of	1
the	1
external	1
forms	1
of	1
propriety	1
till	1
such	1
time	1
his	1
voice	1
shook	1
as	1
i	1
may	1
take	1
measures	1
to	1
secure	1
my	1
honor	1
and	1
communicate	1
them	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
first	1
and	1
helped	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
servants	1
he	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
drove	1
back	1
to	1
petersburg	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
a	1
footman	1
came	1
from	1
princess	1
betsy	1
and	1
brought	1
anna	1
a	1
note	1
i	1
sent	1

he	1
writes	1
me	1
he	1

quite	1
well	1

she	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
she	1
had	1
still	1
three	1
hours	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1

in	1

dreadful	1

in	1
the	1
little	1

place	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
had	1
betaken	1
themselves	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
indeed	1
where	1
people	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
the	1
usual	1
process	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
crystallization	1
of	1
society	1
went	1
on	1
assigning	1
to	1
each	1
member	1
of	1
that	1
society	1
a	1
definite	1
and	1
unalterable	1
place	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
particle	1
of	1
water	1
in	1
frost	1
definitely	1
and	1
unalterably	1
takes	1
the	1
special	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
crystal	1
of	1
snow	1
so	1
each	1
new	1
person	1
that	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
placed	1
in	1
his	1
special	1
place	1
fürst	1
shtcherbatsky	1
sammt	1
gemahlin	1

by	1
the	1

they	1
took	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
name	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
friends	1
they	1
made	1
were	1
immediately	1
crystallized	1
into	1
a	1
definite	1
place	1
marked	1
out	1
for	1
them	1
there	1
was	1
visiting	1
the	1
watering	1
place	1
that	1
year	1
a	1
real	1
german	1
fürstin	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
crystallizing	1
process	1
went	1
on	1
more	1
vigorously	1
than	1
ever	1
princess	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
wished	1
above	1
everything	1
to	1
present	1
her	1
daughter	1
to	1
this	1
german	1
princess	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
their	1
arrival	1
she	1
duly	1
performed	1
this	1
rite	1
kitty	1
made	1
a	1
low	1
and	1
graceful	1
curtsey	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
simple	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
very	1
elegant	1
frock	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
her	1
from	1
paris	1
the	1
german	1
princess	1
said	1
i	1
hope	1
the	1
roses	1
will	1
soon	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
this	1
pretty	1
little	1
face	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
certain	1
definite	1
lines	1
of	1
existence	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
laid	1
down	1
from	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
departing	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
too	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
an	1
english	1
lady	1
somebody	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
german	1
countess	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
war	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
learned	1
swede	1
and	1
of	1
m	1
canut	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
but	1
yet	1
inevitably	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
were	1
thrown	1
most	1
into	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
a	1
moscow	1
lady	1
marya	1
yevgenyevna	1
rtishtcheva	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
whom	1
kitty	1
disliked	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
ill	1
like	1
herself	1
over	1
a	1
love	1
affair	1
and	1
a	1
moscow	1
colonel	1
whom	1
kitty	1
had	1
known	1
from	1
childhood	1
and	1
always	1
seen	1
in	1
uniform	1
and	1
epaulets	1
and	1
who	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
open	1
neck	1
and	1
flowered	1
cravat	1
was	1
uncommonly	1
ridiculous	1
and	1
tedious	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
him	1
when	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
so	1
firmly	1
established	1
kitty	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
bored	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
carlsbad	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
she	1
took	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
she	1
knew	1
feeling	1
that	1
nothing	1
fresh	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
them	1
her	1
chief	1
mental	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
watering	1
place	1
consisted	1
in	1
watching	1
and	1
making	1
theories	1
about	1
the	1
people	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
characteristic	1
of	1
kitty	1
that	1
she	1
always	1
imagined	1
everything	1
in	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
light	1
possible	1
especially	1
so	1
in	1
those	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
now	1
as	1
she	1
made	1
surmises	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
people	1
were	1
what	1
were	1
their	1
relations	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
like	1
kitty	1
endowed	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
marvelous	1
and	1
noble	1
characters	1
and	1
found	1
confirmation	1
of	1
her	1
idea	1
in	1
her	1
observations	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
attracted	1
her	1
most	1
was	1
a	1
russian	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
watering	1
place	1
with	1
an	1
invalid	1
russian	1
lady	1
madame	1
stahl	1
as	1
everyone	1
called	1
her	1
madame	1
stahl	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
ill	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
walk	1
and	1
only	1
on	1
exceptionally	1
fine	1
days	1
made	1
her	1
appearance	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
in	1
an	1
invalid	1
carriage	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
ill	1
health	1
as	1
from	1
pride	1
so	1
princess	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
interpreted	1
it	1
that	1
madame	1
stahl	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
anyone	1
among	1
the	1
russians	1
there	1
the	1
russian	1
girl	1
looked	1
after	1
madame	1
stahl	1
and	1
besides	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
kitty	1
observed	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
invalids	1
who	1
were	1
seriously	1
ill	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
and	1
looked	1
after	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
natural	1
way	1
this	1
russian	1
girl	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
kitty	1
gathered	1
related	1
to	1
madame	1
stahl	1
nor	1
was	1
she	1
a	1
paid	1
attendant	1
madame	1
stahl	1
called	1
her	1
varenka	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
called	1
her	1
mademoiselle	1
varenka	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
interest	1
kitty	1
took	1
in	1
this	1
girl	1
s	1
relations	1
with	1
madame	1
stahl	1
and	1
with	1
other	1
unknown	1
persons	1
kitty	1
as	1
often	1
happened	1
felt	1
an	1
inexplicable	1
attraction	1
to	1
mademoiselle	1
varenka	1
and	1
was	1
aware	1
when	1
their	1
eyes	1
met	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
liked	1
her	1
of	1
mademoiselle	1
varenka	1
one	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
her	1
first	1
youth	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
creature	1
without	1
youth	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
nineteen	1
or	1
for	1
thirty	1
if	1
her	1
features	1
were	1
criticized	1
separately	1
she	1
was	1
handsome	1
rather	1
than	1
plain	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
sickly	1
hue	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
good	1
figure	1
too	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
her	1
extreme	1
thinness	1
and	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
which	1
was	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
her	1
medium	1
height	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
attractive	1
to	1
men	1
she	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
fine	1
flower	1
already	1
past	1
its	1
bloom	1
and	1
without	1
fragrance	1
though	1
the	1
petals	1
were	1
still	1
unwithered	1
moreover	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unattractive	1
to	1
men	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
just	1
what	1
kitty	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
of	1
the	1
suppressed	1
fire	1
of	1
vitality	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
attractiveness	1
she	1
always	1
seemed	1
absorbed	1
in	1
work	1
about	1
which	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
interest	1
in	1
anything	1
outside	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
this	1
contrast	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
that	1
was	1
for	1
kitty	1
the	1
great	1
attraction	1
of	1
mademoiselle	1
varenka	1
kitty	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
she	1
would	1
find	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
painfully	1
seeking	1
interest	1
in	1
life	1
a	1
dignity	1
in	1
life	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
worldly	1
relations	1
of	1
girls	1
with	1
men	1
which	1
so	1
revolted	1
kitty	1
and	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
shameful	1
hawking	1
about	1
of	1
goods	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
a	1
purchaser	1
the	1
more	1
attentively	1
kitty	1
watched	1
her	1
unknown	1
friend	1
the	1
more	1
convinced	1
she	1
was	1
this	1
girl	1
was	1
the	1
perfect	1
creature	1
she	1
fancied	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
eagerly	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
used	1
to	1
meet	1
several	1
times	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
they	1
met	1
kitty	1
s	1
eyes	1
said	1
who	1
are	1
you	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
really	1
the	1
exquisite	1
creature	1
i	1
imagine	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
but	1
for	1
goodness	1
sake	1
don	1
t	1
suppose	1
her	1
eyes	1
added	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
force	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
on	1
you	1
i	1
simply	1
admire	1
you	1
and	1
like	1
you	1
i	1
like	1
you	1
too	1
and	1
you	1
re	1
very	1
very	1
sweet	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
you	1
better	1
still	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
time	1
answered	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
unknown	1
girl	1
kitty	1
saw	1
indeed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
busy	1
either	1
she	1
was	1
taking	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
russian	1
family	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
springs	1
or	1
fetching	1
a	1
shawl	1
for	1
a	1
sick	1
lady	1
and	1
wrapping	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
it	1
or	1
trying	1
to	1
interest	1
an	1
irritable	1
invalid	1
or	1
selecting	1
and	1
buying	1
cakes	1
for	1
tea	1
for	1
someone	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
there	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
crowd	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
two	1
persons	1
who	1
attracted	1
universal	1
and	1
unfavorable	1
attention	1
these	1
were	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
stooping	1
figure	1
and	1
huge	1
hands	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
coat	1
too	1
short	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
black	1
simple	1
and	1
yet	1
terrible	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
pockmarked	1
kind	1
looking	1
woman	1
very	1
badly	1
and	1
tastelessly	1
dressed	1
recognizing	1
these	1
persons	1
as	1
russians	1
kitty	1
had	1
already	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
begun	1
constructing	1
a	1
delightful	1
and	1
touching	1
romance	1
about	1
them	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
having	1
ascertained	1
from	1
the	1
visitors	1
list	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
and	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
explained	1
to	1
kitty	1
what	1
a	1
bad	1
man	1
this	1
levin	1
was	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
fancies	1
about	1
these	1
two	1
people	1
vanished	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
what	1
her	1
mother	1
told	1
her	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
konstantin	1
s	1
brother	1
this	1
pair	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
kitty	1
intensely	1
unpleasant	1
this	1
levin	1
with	1
his	1
continual	1
twitching	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
aroused	1
in	1
her	1
now	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
feeling	1
of	1
disgust	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
his	1
big	1
terrible	1
eyes	1
which	1
persistently	1
pursued	1
her	1
expressed	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
hatred	1
and	1
contempt	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
him	1
chapter	1
31	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
wet	1
day	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
raining	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
the	1
invalids	1
with	1
their	1
parasols	1

towards	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
companion	1
and	1
a	1
german	1
doctor	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
very	1
noisily	1
and	1
angrily	1
they	1
turned	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
when	1
suddenly	1
they	1
heard	1
not	1

shouting	1

was	1
shouting	1
at	1
the	1

a	1

out	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
colonel	1
overtook	1
them	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
inquired	1
the	1
princess	1
scandalous	1
and	1
disgraceful	1
answered	1
the	1
colonel	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
is	1
meeting	1
russians	1
abroad	1
that	1
tall	1
gentleman	1
was	1
abusing	1
the	1
doctor	1
flinging	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
insults	1
at	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
wasn	1
t	1
treating	1
him	1
quite	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
waving	1
his	1
stick	1
at	1
him	1
it	1
s	1
simply	1
a	1
scandal	1
oh	1
how	1
unpleasant	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
well	1
and	1
how	1
did	1
it	1
end	1
luckily	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
mushroom	1
hat	1
intervened	1
a	1
russian	1
lady	1
i	1
think	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
mademoiselle	1
varenka	1
asked	1
kitty	1
yes	1
yes	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
rescue	1
before	1
anyone	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
there	1
mamma	1
said	1
kitty	1
you	1
wonder	1
that	1
i	1

enthusiastic	1
about	1
her	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
her	1
unknown	1
friend	1
kitty	1
noticed	1
that	1
mademoiselle	1
varenka	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
terms	1
with	1
levin	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
as	1
with	1
her	1
other	1
protégés	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
served	1
as	1
interpreter	1
for	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
any	1
foreign	1
language	1
kitty	1
began	1
to	1
entreat	1
her	1
mother	1
still	1
more	1
urgently	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
make	1
friends	1
with	1
varenka	1
and	1
disagreeable	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
to	1
seem	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
in	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
madame	1
stahl	1
who	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
give	1
herself	1
airs	1
she	1
made	1
inquiries	1
about	1
varenka	1
and	1
having	1
ascertained	1
particulars	1
about	1
her	1
tending	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
harm	1
though	1
little	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
she	1
herself	1
approached	1
varenka	1
and	1
made	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
her	1
choosing	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
spring	1
while	1
varenka	1
had	1
stopped	1
outside	1

went	1
up	1
to	1

with	1
her	1
dignified	1
smile	1

lost	1
her	1

she	1
said	1
possibly	1

me	1
i	1
am	1
that	1
feeling	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
reciprocal	1

hurriedly	1
what	1
a	1
good	1
deed	1
you	1
did	1
yesterday	1

poor	1

varenka	1
flushing	1
a	1
little	1
again	1
this	1
was	1
so	1
simply	1
said	1
and	1
so	1
sweet	1
was	1
the	1
truthful	1
and	1
candid	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
saw	1
why	1
kitty	1
had	1
taken	1
such	1
a	1

varenka	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
kitty	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
spring	1
beaming	1
with	1
delight	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
her	1
unknown	1
friend	1
well	1

put	1
in	1
smiling	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
everyone	1
calls	1
me	1
kitty	1
blushed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
slowly	1
without	1
speaking	1
pressed	1
her	1
new	1
friend	1
s	1
hand	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
respond	1
to	1
her	1
pressure	1
but	1
lay	1
motionless	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
the	1
hand	1
did	1
not	1
respond	1
to	1
her	1
pressure	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
mademoiselle	1
varenka	1
glowed	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
glad	1
though	1
rather	1
mournful	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
large	1
but	1
handsome	1
teeth	1
i	1
have	1
long	1
wished	1
for	1

no	1
i	1
m	1
not	1

varenka	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
new	1
friends	1
because	1
two	1
little	1
russian	1
girls	1

past	1
and	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
madame	1
stahl	1
were	1
as	1
follows	1
madame	1
stahl	1
of	1
whom	1
some	1
people	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
worried	1
her	1
husband	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
while	1
others	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
wretched	1
by	1
his	1
immoral	1
behavior	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
weak	1
health	1
and	1
enthusiastic	1
temperament	1
when	1
after	1
her	1
separation	1
from	1
her	1

she	1
gave	1
birth	1
to	1
her	1
only	1
child	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
died	1
almost	1
immediately	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
madame	1
stahl	1
knowing	1
her	1
sensibility	1
and	1
fearing	1
the	1
news	1
would	1
kill	1
her	1
had	1
substituted	1
another	1
child	1
a	1
baby	1
born	1
the	1

night	1
and	1
in	1

of	1
the	1
imperial	1
household	1
this	1
was	1
varenka	1
madame	1
stahl	1
learned	1
later	1
on	1
that	1
varenka	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
own	1
child	1
but	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
bringing	1
her	1
up	1
especially	1
as	1
very	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
varenka	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
living	1
madame	1

now	1
been	1
living	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
years	1
continuously	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
never	1
leaving	1
her	1
couch	1
and	1
some	1
people	1
said	1
that	1
madame	1
stahl	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
social	1
position	1
as	1
a	1
philanthropic	1
highly	1
religious	1
woman	1
other	1
people	1
said	1
she	1
really	1
was	1
at	1
heart	1
the	1
highly	1
ethical	1
being	1
living	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
her	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
which	1
she	1
represented	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
what	1
her	1
faith	1
was	1
catholic	1
protestant	1
or	1
orthodox	1
but	1
one	1
fact	1
was	1
indubitable	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
amicable	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
highest	1
dignitaries	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
and	1
sects	1
varenka	1
lived	1
with	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
abroad	1
and	1
everyone	1
who	1
knew	1
madame	1
stahl	1
knew	1
and	1
liked	1
mademoiselle	1
varenka	1
as	1
everyone	1
called	1
her	1
having	1
learned	1
all	1
these	1
facts	1
the	1
princess	1
found	1
nothing	1
to	1
object	1
to	1
in	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
intimacy	1
with	1
varenka	1
more	1
especially	1
as	1
varenka	1
s	1
breeding	1
and	1
education	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
she	1
spoke	1
french	1
and	1
english	1
extremely	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
weight	1
brought	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
madame	1
stahl	1
expressing	1
her	1
regret	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
prevented	1
by	1
her	1
ill	1
health	1
from	1
making	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
after	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
varenka	1
kitty	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
fascinated	1
by	1
her	1
friend	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
she	1
discovered	1
new	1
virtues	1
in	1
her	1
the	1
princess	1
hearing	1
that	1
varenka	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
voice	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
sing	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
kitty	1
plays	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
piano	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
one	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
so	1
much	1
pleasure	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
her	1
affected	1
smile	1
which	1
kitty	1
disliked	1
particularly	1
just	1
then	1
because	1
she	1
noticed	1
that	1
varenka	1
had	1
no	1
inclination	1
to	1
sing	1
varenka	1
came	1
however	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
music	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
invited	1
marya	1
yevgenyevna	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
the	1
colonel	1
varenka	1
seemed	1
quite	1
unaffected	1
by	1
there	1
being	1
persons	1
present	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
piano	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
accompany	1
herself	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
sing	1
music	1
at	1
sight	1
very	1
well	1
kitty	1
who	1
played	1
well	1
accompanied	1
her	1
you	1
have	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
talent	1
the	1
princess	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
after	1
varenka	1
had	1
sung	1
the	1
first	1
song	1
extremely	1
well	1
marya	1
yevgenyevna	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
expressed	1
their	1
thanks	1
and	1
admiration	1
look	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
what	1
an	1
audience	1
has	1
collected	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
you	1
there	1
actually	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
considerable	1
crowd	1
under	1
the	1
windows	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
it	1
gives	1
you	1
pleasure	1
varenka	1
answered	1
simply	1
kitty	1
looked	1
with	1
pride	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
she	1
was	1
enchanted	1
by	1
her	1
talent	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
by	1
her	1
manner	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
varenka	1
obviously	1
thought	1
nothing	1
of	1
her	1
singing	1
and	1
was	1
quite	1
unmoved	1
by	1
their	1
praises	1
she	1
seemed	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
asking	1
am	1

to	1
sing	1
again	1
or	1
is	1
that	1
enough	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
i	1
thought	1
kitty	1
how	1
proud	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
how	1
delighted	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
crowd	1
under	1
the	1
windows	1
but	1
she	1
s	1
utterly	1
unmoved	1
by	1
it	1
her	1
only	1
motive	1
is	1
to	1
avoid	1
refusing	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
mamma	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
her	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
gives	1
her	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
look	1
down	1
on	1
everything	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
independently	1
of	1
everything	1
how	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
learn	1
it	1
of	1
her	1
thought	1
kitty	1
gazing	1
into	1
her	1
serene	1
face	1
the	1
princess	1
asked	1
varenka	1
to	1
sing	1
again	1
and	1
varenka	1
sang	1
another	1
song	1
also	1
smoothly	1
distinctly	1
and	1
well	1
standing	1
erect	1
at	1
the	1
piano	1
and	1
beating	1
time	1
on	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
dark	1
skinned	1
hand	1
the	1
next	1
song	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
an	1
italian	1
one	1
kitty	1
played	1
the	1
opening	1
bars	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
varenka	1
let	1
s	1
skip	1
that	1
said	1
varenka	1
flushing	1
a	1
little	1
kitty	1
let	1
her	1
eyes	1
rest	1
on	1
varenka	1
s	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
dismay	1
and	1
inquiry	1
very	1
well	1
the	1
next	1
one	1
she	1
said	1
hurriedly	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
pages	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
feeling	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
song	1
no	1
answered	1
varenka	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
music	1
no	1
let	1
s	1
have	1
that	1
one	1
and	1
she	1
sang	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
coolly	1
and	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
they	1
all	1
thanked	1
her	1
again	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
tea	1
kitty	1
and	1
varenka	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
that	1
adjoined	1
the	1
house	1
am	1
i	1
right	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
reminiscences	1
connected	1
with	1
that	1
song	1
said	1
kitty	1
don	1

tell	1
me	1
she	1
added	1
hastily	1
only	1
say	1
if	1
i	1
m	1
right	1
no	1
why	1
not	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
simply	1
said	1
varenka	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
yes	1
it	1
brings	1
up	1
memories	1
once	1
painful	1
ones	1
i	1
cared	1
for	1
someone	1
once	1
and	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
sing	1
him	1
that	1
song	1

with	1
big	1
wide	1
open	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
silently	1
sympathetically	1
at	1
varenka	1
i	1
cared	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
his	1
mother	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
married	1
another	1
girl	1
he	1
s	1
living	1
now	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
us	1
and	1
i	1

him	1
sometimes	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
think	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
love	1
story	1
too	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
faint	1
gleam	1
in	1
her	1
handsome	1
face	1
of	1
that	1
fire	1
which	1
kitty	1
felt	1
must	1
once	1
have	1
glowed	1
all	1
over	1
her	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
think	1
so	1
why	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
a	1
man	1
i	1
could	1
never	1
care	1
for	1
anyone	1
else	1
after	1
knowing	1
you	1
only	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
please	1
his	1
mother	1
forget	1
you	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
unhappy	1
he	1
had	1
no	1

a	1
very	1
good	1

well	1
so	1
we	1

towards	1
the	1
house	1
how	1

her	1
if	1

of	1
his	1

if	1
it	1

his	1

kitty	1
feeling	1
she	1
was	1
giving	1
away	1
her	1
secret	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
face	1
burning	1
with	1
the	1
flush	1
of	1
shame	1
had	1
betrayed	1
her	1
already	1
in	1
that	1

he	1
would	1

wrong	1
and	1
i	1
should	1

him	1
answered	1
varenka	1
evidently	1
realizing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
talking	1
not	1
of	1
her	1

of	1
kitty	1

the	1

the	1

in	1

varenka	1

her	1

her	1

on	1
kitty	1

why	1
what	1

at	1

her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
passionate	1
curiosity	1
and	1
entreaty	1
her	1

asked	1
her	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
what	1

that	1
gives	1
you	1

did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
kitty	1

eyes	1
were	1
asking	1
her	1
she	1
merely	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
madame	1

about	1

away	1

the	1

and	1
this	1
acquaintance	1
together	1
with	1
her	1
friendship	1
with	1
varenka	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
exercise	1
a	1
great	1
influence	1
on	1

it	1
also	1
comforted	1
her	1
in	1
her	1

distress	1
she	1
found	1
this	1
comfort	1
through	1
a	1
completely	1
new	1
world	1
being	1
opened	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
this	1

a	1
world	1
having	1
nothing	1
in	1

with	1
her	1
past	1
an	1
exalted	1

world	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
contemplate	1
her	1
past	1
calmly	1
it	1
was	1
revealed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
besides	1
the	1
instinctive	1
life	1
to	1
which	1
kitty	1
had	1
given	1
herself	1
up	1
hitherto	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
spiritual	1
life	1
this	1
life	1
was	1
disclosed	1
in	1
religion	1
but	1
a	1
religion	1
having	1
nothing	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
that	1
one	1
which	1
kitty	1
had	1
known	1
from	1
childhood	1
and	1
which	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
litanies	1
and	1
all	1
night	1
services	1
at	1
the	1
widow	1
s	1
home	1
where	1

might	1
meet	1

and	1
in	1
learning	1
by	1

slavonic	1
texts	1
with	1
the	1
priest	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
lofty	1
mysterious	1
religion	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
noble	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
merely	1
believe	1
because	1
one	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
love	1
kitty	1
found	1
all	1
this	1
out	1
not	1
from	1
words	1
madame	1
stahl	1
talked	1
to	1
kitty	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
charming	1
child	1
that	1
one	1
looks	1
on	1
with	1
pleasure	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
one	1
s	1
youth	1
and	1
only	1
once	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
passing	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
human	1
sorrows	1
nothing	1
gives	1
comfort	1
but	1
love	1
and	1
faith	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
christ	1
s	1
compassion	1
for	1
us	1
no	1
sorrow	1
is	1
trifling	1
and	1
immediately	1
talked	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
but	1
in	1
every	1
gesture	1
of	1
madame	1
stahl	1
in	1
every	1
word	1
in	1
every	1
heavenly	1
as	1
kitty	1
called	1
it	1
look	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
which	1
she	1
heard	1
from	1
varenka	1
kitty	1
recognized	1
that	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
important	1
of	1
which	1
till	1
then	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
nothing	1
yet	1
elevated	1
as	1
madame	1
stahl	1
s	1
character	1
was	1
touching	1
as	1
was	1
her	1
story	1
and	1
exalted	1
and	1
moving	1
as	1
was	1
her	1
speech	1
kitty	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
detecting	1
in	1
her	1
some	1
traits	1
which	1
perplexed	1
her	1
she	1
noticed	1
that	1
when	1
questioning	1
her	1
about	1
her	1
family	1
madame	1
stahl	1
had	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
christian	1
meekness	1
she	1
noticed	1
too	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
catholic	1
priest	1
with	1
her	1
madame	1
stahl	1
had	1
studiously	1
kept	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
shade	1
and	1
had	1
smiled	1
in	1
a	1
peculiar	1
way	1
trivial	1
as	1
these	1
two	1
observations	1
were	1
they	1
perplexed	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
her	1
doubts	1
as	1
to	1
madame	1
stahl	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
varenka	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
without	1
friends	1
or	1
relations	1
with	1
a	1
melancholy	1
disappointment	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
desiring	1
nothing	1
regretting	1
nothing	1
was	1
just	1
that	1
perfection	1
of	1
which	1
kitty	1
dared	1
hardly	1
dream	1
in	1
varenka	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
but	1
to	1
forget	1
oneself	1
and	1
love	1
others	1
and	1
one	1
will	1
be	1
calm	1
happy	1
and	1
noble	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
kitty	1
longed	1
to	1
be	1
seeing	1
now	1
clearly	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
kitty	1
was	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
being	1
enthusiastic	1
over	1
it	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
herself	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
soul	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
life	1
that	1
was	1
opening	1
to	1
her	1
from	1
varenka	1
s	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
madame	1
stahl	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
whom	1
she	1
mentioned	1
kitty	1
had	1
already	1
constructed	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
future	1
life	1
she	1
would	1
like	1
madame	1
stahl	1
s	1
niece	1
aline	1
of	1
whom	1
varenka	1
had	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
seek	1
out	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
trouble	1
wherever	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
living	1
help	1
them	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
gospel	1
read	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
to	1
criminals	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
reading	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
criminals	1
as	1
aline	1
did	1
particularly	1
fascinated	1
kitty	1
but	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
secret	1
dreams	1
of	1
which	1
kitty	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
either	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
or	1
to	1
varenka	1
while	1
awaiting	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
carrying	1
out	1
her	1
plans	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale	1
however	1
kitty	1
even	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
ill	1
and	1
unhappy	1
readily	1
found	1
a	1
chance	1
for	1
practicing	1
her	1
new	1
principles	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
varenka	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
kitty	1
was	1
much	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
her	1
engouement	1
as	1
she	1
called	1
it	1
for	1
madame	1
stahl	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
for	1
varenka	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
kitty	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
imitate	1
varenka	1
in	1
her	1
conduct	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
imitated	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
walking	1
of	1
talking	1
of	1
blinking	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
later	1
on	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
that	1
apart	1
from	1
this	1
adoration	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
serious	1
spiritual	1
change	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
her	1
daughter	1
the	1
princess	1
saw	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
evenings	1
kitty	1
read	1
a	1
french	1
testament	1
that	1
madame	1
stahl	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
a	1
thing	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
done	1
before	1
that	1
she	1
avoided	1
society	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
sick	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
under	1
varenka	1
s	1
protection	1
and	1
especially	1
one	1
poor	1
family	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
sick	1
painter	1
petrov	1
kitty	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
proud	1
of	1
playing	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
sister	1
of	1
mercy	1
in	1
that	1
family	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
well	1
enough	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
it	1
especially	1
as	1
petrov	1
s	1
wife	1
was	1
a	1
perfectly	1
nice	1
sort	1
of	1
woman	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
german	1
princess	1
noticing	1
kitty	1
s	1
devotion	1
praised	1
her	1
calling	1
her	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
consolation	1
all	1
this	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
well	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
exaggeration	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
was	1
rushing	1
into	1
extremes	1
and	1
so	1
indeed	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
il	1
ne	1
faut	1
jamais	1
rien	1
outrer	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
her	1
daughter	1
made	1
her	1
no	1
reply	1
only	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
exaggeration	1
where	1
christianity	1
was	1
concerned	1
what	1
exaggeration	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
a	1
doctrine	1
wherein	1
one	1
was	1
bidden	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
other	1
cheek	1
when	1
one	1
was	1
smitten	1
and	1
give	1
one	1
s	1
cloak	1
if	1
one	1
s	1
coat	1
were	1
taken	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
disliked	1
this	1
exaggeration	1
and	1
disliked	1
even	1
more	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
daughter	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
kitty	1
did	1
in	1
fact	1
conceal	1
her	1
new	1
views	1
and	1
feelings	1
from	1
her	1
mother	1
she	1
concealed	1
them	1
not	1
because	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
respect	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her	1
mother	1
but	1
simply	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
her	1
mother	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
revealed	1
them	1
to	1
anyone	1
sooner	1
than	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
s	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
the	1
princess	1
said	1
one	1
day	1
of	1
madame	1
petrova	1
i	1
ve	1
asked	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
seems	1
put	1
out	1
about	1
something	1
no	1
i	1
ve	1
not	1
noticed	1
it	1
maman	1
said	1
kitty	1
flushing	1
hotly	1
is	1
it	1
long	1
since	1
you	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
we	1
re	1
meaning	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
expedition	1
to	1
the	1
mountains	1
tomorrow	1
answered	1
kitty	1
well	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
answered	1
the	1
princess	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
embarrassed	1
face	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
embarrassment	1
that	1
day	1
varenka	1
came	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
had	1
changed	1
her	1
mind	1
and	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
expedition	1
for	1
the	1
morrow	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
again	1
that	1
kitty	1
reddened	1
kitty	1
haven	1
t	1
you	1
had	1
some	1
misunderstanding	1
with	1
the	1
petrovs	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
why	1
has	1
she	1
given	1
up	1
sending	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
kitty	1
answered	1
that	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
why	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
seemed	1
displeased	1
with	1
her	1
kitty	1
answered	1
perfectly	1
truly	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
reason	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
had	1
changed	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
guessed	1
it	1
she	1
guessed	1
at	1
something	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
her	1
mother	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
put	1
into	1
words	1
to	1
herself	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
one	1
knows	1
but	1
which	1
one	1
can	1
never	1
speak	1
of	1
even	1
to	1
oneself	1
so	1
terrible	1
and	1
shameful	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
went	1
over	1
in	1
her	1
memory	1
all	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
she	1
remembered	1
the	1
simple	1
delight	1
expressed	1
on	1
the	1
round	1
good	1
humored	1
face	1
of	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
at	1
their	1
meetings	1
she	1
remembered	1
their	1
secret	1
confabulations	1
about	1
the	1
invalid	1
their	1
plots	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
was	1
forbidden	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
the	1
devotion	1
of	1
the	1
youngest	1
boy	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
my	1
kitty	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
without	1
her	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
then	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
thin	1
terribly	1
thin	1
figure	1
of	1
petrov	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
neck	1
in	1
his	1
brown	1
coat	1
his	1
scant	1
curly	1
hair	1
his	1
questioning	1
blue	1
eyes	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
terrible	1
to	1
kitty	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
his	1
painful	1
attempts	1
to	1
seem	1
hearty	1
and	1
lively	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
efforts	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
at	1
first	1
to	1
overcome	1
the	1
repugnance	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
for	1
all	1
consumptive	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
pains	1
it	1
had	1
cost	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
timid	1
softened	1
look	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
compassion	1
and	1
awkwardness	1
and	1
later	1
of	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
goodness	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
at	1
it	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
now	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
ago	1
everything	1
was	1
suddenly	1
spoiled	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
had	1
met	1
kitty	1
with	1
affected	1
cordiality	1
and	1
had	1
kept	1
continual	1
watch	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
could	1
that	1
touching	1
pleasure	1
he	1
showed	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
near	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
s	1
coolness	1
yes	1
she	1
mused	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
unnatural	1
about	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
and	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
her	1
good	1
nature	1
when	1
she	1
said	1
angrily	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
there	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
waiting	1
for	1
you	1
he	1
wouldn	1
t	1
drink	1
his	1
coffee	1
without	1
you	1
though	1
he	1
s	1
grown	1
so	1
dreadfully	1
weak	1
yes	1
perhaps	1
too	1
she	1
didn	1
t	1
like	1
it	1
when	1
i	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
rug	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
simple	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
so	1
awkwardly	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
long	1
thanking	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
felt	1
awkward	1
too	1
and	1
then	1
that	1
portrait	1
of	1
me	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
look	1
of	1
confusion	1
and	1
tenderness	1
yes	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
kitty	1
repeated	1
to	1
herself	1
with	1
horror	1
no	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
it	1
oughtn	1
t	1
to	1
be	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
directly	1
after	1
this	1
doubt	1
poisoned	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
her	1
new	1
life	1
chapter	1
34	1
before	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
drinking	1
the	1
waters	1
prince	1
shtcherbatsky	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
from	1
carlsbad	1
to	1
baden	1
and	1
kissingen	1
to	1
russian	1
friends	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
breath	1
of	1
russian	1
air	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
daughter	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
on	1
life	1
abroad	1
were	1
completely	1
opposed	1
the	1
princess	1
thought	1
everything	1
delightful	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
established	1
position	1
in	1
russian	1
society	1
she	1
tried	1
abroad	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
european	1
fashionable	1
lady	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
simple	1
reason	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
typical	1
russian	1
gentlewoman	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
affected	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
altogether	1
suit	1
her	1
the	1
prince	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
thought	1
everything	1
foreign	1
detestable	1
got	1
sick	1
of	1
european	1
life	1
kept	1
to	1
his	1
russian	1
habits	1
and	1
purposely	1
tried	1
to	1
show	1
himself	1
abroad	1
less	1
european	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
the	1
prince	1
returned	1
thinner	1
with	1
the	1
skin	1
hanging	1
in	1
loose	1
bags	1
on	1
his	1
cheeks	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
cheerful	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
his	1
good	1
humor	1
was	1
even	1
greater	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
kitty	1
completely	1
recovered	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
friendship	1
with	1
madame	1
stahl	1
and	1
varenka	1
and	1
the	1
reports	1
the	1
princess	1
gave	1
him	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
change	1
she	1
had	1
noticed	1
in	1
kitty	1
troubled	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
aroused	1
his	1
habitual	1
feeling	1
of	1
jealousy	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
drew	1
his	1
daughter	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
dread	1
that	1
his	1
daughter	1
might	1
have	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
his	1
influence	1
into	1
regions	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
these	1
unpleasant	1
matters	1
were	1
all	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
kindliness	1
and	1
good	1
humor	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
within	1
him	1
and	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
ever	1
since	1
his	1
course	1
of	1
carlsbad	1
waters	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
his	1
long	1
overcoat	1
with	1
his	1
russian	1
wrinkles	1
and	1
baggy	1
cheeks	1
propped	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
starched	1
collar	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
the	1
spring	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
good	1
humor	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
lovely	1
morning	1
the	1
bright	1
cheerful	1
houses	1
with	1
their	1
little	1
gardens	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
faced	1
red	1
armed	1
beer	1
drinking	1
german	1
waitresses	1
working	1
away	1
merrily	1
did	1
the	1
heart	1
good	1
but	1
the	1
nearer	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
springs	1
the	1
oftener	1
they	1
met	1
sick	1
people	1
and	1
their	1
appearance	1
seemed	1
more	1
pitiable	1
than	1
ever	1
among	1
the	1
everyday	1
conditions	1
of	1
prosperous	1
german	1
life	1
kitty	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
struck	1
by	1
this	1
contrast	1
the	1
bright	1
sun	1
the	1
brilliant	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
foliage	1
the	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
music	1
were	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
natural	1
setting	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
familiar	1
faces	1
with	1
their	1
changes	1
to	1
greater	1
emaciation	1
or	1
to	1
convalescence	1
for	1
which	1
she	1

to	1
the	1
prince	1
the	1
brightness	1
and	1
gaiety	1
of	1
the	1
june	1
morning	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
orchestra	1
playing	1
a	1
gay	1
waltz	1
then	1
in	1
fashion	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
healthy	1
attendants	1
seemed	1
something	1
unseemly	1
and	1
monstrous	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
these	1
slowly	1
moving	1
dying	1
figures	1
gathered	1
together	1
from	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1

of	1

of	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
youth	1
with	1
his	1
favorite	1
daughter	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
felt	1
awkward	1
and	1
almost	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
vigorous	1
step	1
and	1
his	1
sturdy	1
stout	1
limbs	1
he	1
felt	1
almost	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
crowd	1
present	1
me	1
to	1
your	1

his	1

squeezing	1
her	1

with	1
his	1
elbow	1
i	1

of	1

of	1

the	1

delighted	1
to	1

up	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1

at	1
once	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
french	1
exaggerated	1
politeness	1
applauding	1
him	1
for	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
delightful	1
daughter	1
extolling	1

to	1
the	1

towards	1

did	1
everything	1
a	1
movement	1
between	1
a	1

and	1
a	1
curtsey	1
and	1
immediately	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1

said	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
in	1
which	1
kitty	1
detected	1
with	1
joy	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
liked	1
her	1
friend	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to	1

to	1
kitty	1

that	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
varenka	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1

we	1

deigns	1
to	1
recognize	1
me	1
why	1
did	1
you	1

her	1
papa	1
kitty	1
asked	1
apprehensively	1
catching	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
irony	1
that	1
kindled	1
in	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
madame	1

dismayed	1
to	1

highly	1
in	1
madame	1

rather	1

as	1

didn	1
t	1
get	1
on	1
together	1
who	1
s	1
that	1
what	1
a	1
piteous	1
face	1
he	1
asked	1
noticing	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
wearing	1
a	1
brown	1
overcoat	1
and	1
white	1
trousers	1
that	1
fell	1
in	1
strange	1
folds	1
about	1
his	1
long	1
fleshless	1
legs	1
this	1
man	1
lifted	1
his	1
straw	1
hat	1
showed	1
his	1
scanty	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
high	1
forehead	1
painfully	1
reddened	1
by	1
the	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
hat	1
that	1
s	1
petrov	1
an	1
artist	1
answered	1
kitty	1
blushing	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
his	1
wife	1
she	1
added	1
indicating	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
who	1
as	1
though	1
on	1
purpose	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
they	1
approached	1
walked	1
away	1
after	1
a	1
child	1
that	1
had	1
run	1
off	1
along	1
a	1
path	1
poor	1
fellow	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
nice	1
face	1
he	1
has	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
well	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
then	1
said	1
kitty	1
turning	1
round	1
resolutely	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
feeling	1
today	1
she	1
asked	1
petrov	1
petrov	1
got	1
up	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
stick	1
and	1
looked	1
shyly	1
at	1
the	1
prince	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
daughter	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
let	1
me	1
introduce	1
myself	1
the	1
painter	1
bowed	1
and	1
smiled	1
showing	1
his	1
strangely	1
dazzling	1
white	1
teeth	1
we	1
expected	1
you	1
yesterday	1
princess	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
kitty	1
he	1
staggered	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
and	1
then	1
repeated	1
the	1
motion	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
intentional	1
i	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
but	1
varenka	1
said	1
that	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
sent	1
word	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
going	1
not	1
going	1
said	1
petrov	1
blushing	1
and	1
immediately	1
beginning	1
to	1
cough	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
sought	1
his	1
wife	1
anita	1
anita	1
he	1
said	1
loudly	1
and	1
the	1
swollen	1
veins	1
stood	1
out	1
like	1
cords	1
on	1
his	1
thin	1
white	1
neck	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
came	1
up	1
so	1
you	1
sent	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
we	1
weren	1
t	1
going	1
he	1
whispered	1
to	1
her	1
angrily	1
losing	1
his	1
voice	1
good	1
morning	1
princess	1
said	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
with	1
an	1
assumed	1
smile	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
her	1
former	1
manner	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
you	1
ve	1
long	1
been	1
expected	1
prince	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
send	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
we	1
weren	1
t	1
going	1
for	1
the	1
artist	1
whispered	1
hoarsely	1
once	1
more	1
still	1
more	1
angrily	1
obviously	1
exasperated	1
that	1
his	1
voice	1
failed	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
his	1
words	1
the	1
expression	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
oh	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
i	1
thought	1
we	1
weren	1
t	1
going	1
his	1
wife	1
answered	1
crossly	1
what	1
when	1
he	1
coughed	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
prince	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
ah	1
ah	1
he	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
oh	1
poor	1
things	1
yes	1
papa	1
answered	1
kitty	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
they	1

and	1
scarcely	1
any	1

gets	1
something	1
from	1
the	1
academy	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
briskly	1
trying	1
to	1
drown	1
the	1
distress	1
that	1
the	1
queer	1
change	1
in	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
s	1
manner	1
to	1
her	1
had	1
aroused	1
in	1
her	1
oh	1
here	1
s	1
madame	1
stahl	1
said	1
kitty	1
indicating	1
an	1
invalid	1
carriage	1
where	1
propped	1
on	1
pillows	1
something	1
in	1
gray	1
and	1
blue	1
was	1
lying	1
under	1
a	1
sunshade	1

was	1
madame	1

the	1
gloomy	1
healthy	1
looking	1
german	1
workman	1
who	1
pushed	1
the	1
carriage	1
close	1
by	1
was	1
standing	1
a	1
flaxen	1
headed	1
swedish	1
count	1
whom	1
kitty	1
knew	1
by	1
name	1
several	1
invalids	1
were	1
lingering	1
near	1
the	1
low	1
carriage	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
lady	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
some	1
curiosity	1
the	1
prince	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
kitty	1
detected	1
that	1
disconcerting	1
gleam	1
of	1
irony	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
madame	1
stahl	1
and	1
addressed	1
her	1
with	1
extreme	1
courtesy	1
and	1
affability	1
in	1
that	1
excellent	1
french	1
that	1
so	1
few	1
speak	1
nowadays	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
if	1
you	1
remember	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
recall	1
myself	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
kindness	1
to	1
my	1
daughter	1

said	1

off	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
not	1
putting	1
it	1
on	1
again	1
prince	1
alexander	1
shtcherbatsky	1
said	1
madame	1
stahl	1
lifting	1
upon	1
him	1
her	1
heavenly	1
eyes	1
in	1
which	1
kitty	1
discerned	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
annoyance	1
delighted	1
i	1
have	1
taken	1
a	1
great	1
fancy	1
to	1
your	1
daughter	1
you	1
are	1
still	1
in	1
weak	1
health	1
yes	1
i	1
m	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
said	1
madame	1
stahl	1
and	1
she	1
introduced	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
the	1
swedish	1
count	1
you	1
are	1
scarcely	1
changed	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
prince	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
s	1
ten	1
or	1
eleven	1
years	1
since	1
i	1
had	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
yes	1
god	1
sends	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
sends	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
often	1
one	1
wonders	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
goal	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
she	1
said	1
angrily	1
to	1
varenka	1
who	1
had	1
rearranged	1
the	1
rug	1
over	1
her	1
feet	1
not	1
to	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
probably	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
twinkle	1
in	1
his	1
eye	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
judge	1
said	1
madame	1
stahl	1
perceiving	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
face	1
so	1
you	1
will	1
send	1
me	1
that	1
book	1
dear	1
count	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
swede	1
ah	1
cried	1
the	1
prince	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
moscow	1
colonel	1
standing	1
near	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
madame	1
stahl	1
he	1
walked	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
the	1
moscow	1
colonel	1
who	1
joined	1
them	1
that	1
s	1
our	1
aristocracy	1
prince	1
the	1
moscow	1
colonel	1
said	1
with	1
ironical	1
intention	1
he	1
cherished	1
a	1
grudge	1
against	1
madame	1
stahl	1
for	1
not	1
making	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
she	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
did	1
you	1
know	1
her	1
before	1
her	1
illness	1
prince	1
that	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
before	1
she	1
took	1
to	1
her	1
bed	1
yes	1
she	1
took	1
to	1
her	1
bed	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
they	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
ten	1
years	1
since	1
she	1
has	1
stood	1
on	1
her	1
feet	1
she	1
doesn	1
t	1
stand	1
up	1
because	1
her	1
legs	1
are	1
too	1
short	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
figure	1
papa	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
possible	1
cried	1
kitty	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
wicked	1
tongues	1
say	1
my	1
darling	1
and	1
your	1
varenka	1
catches	1
it	1
too	1
he	1
added	1
oh	1
these	1
invalid	1
ladies	1
oh	1
no	1
papa	1
kitty	1
objected	1
warmly	1
varenka	1
worships	1
her	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
does	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
ask	1
anyone	1
everyone	1
knows	1
her	1
and	1
aline	1
stahl	1
perhaps	1
so	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
squeezing	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
elbow	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
better	1
when	1
one	1
does	1
good	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
ask	1
everyone	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
knows	1
kitty	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
not	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
because	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
reveal	1
her	1
secret	1
thoughts	1
even	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
but	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
although	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
influenced	1
by	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
views	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
into	1
her	1
inmost	1
sanctuary	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
heavenly	1
image	1
of	1
madame	1
stahl	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
carried	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
had	1
vanished	1
never	1
to	1
return	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
fantastic	1
figure	1

under	1
the	1

of	1
his	1
good	1

half	1

later	1
the	1
invalid	1

from	1

who	1
lived	1
on	1
the	1

at	1

set	1
with	1

bread	1
and	1

sat	1
the	1

in	1
a	1
high	1
cap	1
with	1
lilac	1
ribbons	1
distributing	1
cups	1
and	1
bread	1
and	1
butter	1
at	1
the	1

sat	1
the	1
prince	1
eating	1
heartily	1
and	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
merrily	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
spread	1
out	1
near	1
him	1
his	1
purchases	1
carved	1
boxes	1
and	1
knick	1
knacks	1
paper	1
knives	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
bought	1
a	1
heap	1
at	1

bestowed	1
them	1
upon	1
everyone	1
including	1
lieschen	1
the	1
servant	1

and	1
the	1
landlord	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
jested	1
in	1

comically	1
bad	1
german	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
water	1
had	1
cured	1
kitty	1
but	1
his	1
splendid	1
cookery	1
especially	1
his	1
plum	1
soup	1
the	1
princess	1
laughed	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
for	1
his	1
russian	1
ways	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
lively	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
the	1
colonel	1
smiled	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
at	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
jokes	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
regards	1
europe	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
believed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
a	1
careful	1
study	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
side	1
the	1
simple	1
hearted	1
marya	1
yevgenyevna	1
simply	1
roared	1
with	1
laughter	1
at	1
everything	1
absurd	1
the	1
prince	1
said	1
and	1
his	1
jokes	1
made	1
varenka	1
helpless	1
with	1
feeble	1
but	1
infectious	1
laughter	1
which	1
was	1
something	1
kitty	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
kitty	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
light	1
hearted	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
solve	1
the	1
problem	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
set	1
her	1
by	1
his	1
good	1
humored	1
view	1
of	1
her	1
friends	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
so	1
attracted	1
her	1
to	1
this	1
doubt	1
there	1
was	1
joined	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
petrovs	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
conspicuously	1
and	1
unpleasantly	1
marked	1
that	1
morning	1
everyone	1
was	1
good	1
humored	1
but	1
kitty	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
good	1
humored	1
and	1
this	1
increased	1
her	1
distress	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
feeling	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
childhood	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
shut	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
as	1
a	1
punishment	1
and	1
had	1
heard	1
her	1
sisters	1
merry	1
laughter	1
outside	1
well	1
but	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
buy	1
this	1
mass	1
of	1
things	1
for	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
smiling	1
and	1
handing	1
her	1
husband	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee	1
one	1
goes	1
for	1
a	1

smiling	1
well	1
well	1
kitty	1
urged	1
impatiently	1
looking	1
darkly	1
at	1
varenka	1
well	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
anna	1
pavlovna	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
here	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
was	1
nonsense	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dispute	1
over	1
it	1
over	1
you	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
irritable	1
these	1
sick	1
people	1
are	1
kitty	1
scowling	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
kept	1
silent	1
and	1
varenka	1
went	1
on	1
speaking	1
alone	1
trying	1
to	1
soften	1
or	1
soothe	1
her	1
and	1
seeing	1
a	1
storm	1
coming	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
of	1
tears	1
or	1
of	1
words	1
so	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
not	1
go	1
you	1
understand	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
offended	1
and	1
it	1
serves	1
me	1
right	1
and	1
it	1
serves	1
me	1
right	1
kitty	1
cried	1
quickly	1
snatching	1
the	1
parasol	1
out	1
of	1
varenka	1
s	1
hand	1
and	1
looking	1
past	1
her	1
friend	1
s	1
face	1
varenka	1
felt	1
inclined	1
to	1
smile	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
childish	1
fury	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
wounding	1
her	1
how	1
does	1
it	1
serve	1
you	1
right	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
serves	1
me	1
right	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
sham	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
on	1
purpose	1
and	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
what	1
business	1
had	1
i	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
outsiders	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
s	1
come	1
about	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
quarrel	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
ve	1
done	1
what	1
nobody	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
sham	1
a	1
sham	1
a	1
sham	1
a	1
sham	1
with	1
what	1
object	1
said	1
varenka	1
gently	1
oh	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
idiotic	1
so	1
hateful	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
whatever	1
for	1
me	1
nothing	1

sham	1
she	1
said	1
opening	1
and	1
shutting	1
the	1
parasol	1

with	1
what	1
object	1
to	1
seem	1
better	1
to	1
people	1
to	1
myself	1
to	1
god	1
to	1
deceive	1
everyone	1
no	1
now	1
i	1
won	1

that	1
i	1

but	1
who	1

cheat	1
said	1
varenka	1
reproachfully	1
you	1

in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
gusts	1
of	1
fury	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
finish	1
i	1
don	1

about	1
you	1

was	1

sense	1
of	1
its	1
utility	1
to	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
the	1

was	1
good	1
first	1
because	1
it	1
afforded	1
a	1
field	1
for	1

of	1

of	1
which	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1

to	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
particularly	1
good	1
because	1
there	1

fitting	1
to	1

nothing	1

ivanovitch	1
s	1
attitude	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
rather	1
piqued	1
konstantin	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
liked	1
the	1
peasantry	1
and	1
he	1
often	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
without	1
affectation	1
or	1
condescension	1
and	1
from	1
every	1
such	1
conversation	1
he	1
would	1
deduce	1
general	1
conclusions	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
peasantry	1
and	1
in	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
knowing	1

did	1
not	1
like	1
such	1
an	1
attitude	1
to	1
the	1

to	1
konstantin	1
the	1
peasant	1
was	1
simply	1
the	1
chief	1
partner	1
in	1
their	1
common	1
labor	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
respect	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
almost	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
kinship	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
peasant	1
sucked	1
in	1
probably	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
his	1
peasant	1
nurse	1
still	1
as	1
a	1
fellow	1
worker	1

while	1
sometimes	1
enthusiastic	1
over	1
the	1
vigor	1
gentleness	1
and	1
justice	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
often	1
when	1
their	1
common	1
labors	1
called	1
for	1
other	1
qualities	1
exasperated	1
with	1
the	1
peasant	1
for	1
his	1
carelessness	1
lack	1
of	1
method	1
drunkenness	1
and	1
lying	1
if	1

at	1

what	1
to	1

he	1
liked	1
and	1
did	1
not	1

just	1
as	1

of	1
course	1

rather	1
than	1
he	1
disliked	1
them	1
and	1
so	1
too	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
but	1
like	1
or	1
dislike	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
something	1
apart	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
not	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
lived	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
interests	1
were	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
theirs	1
but	1
also	1
because	1
he	1
regarded	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
any	1
special	1
qualities	1
or	1
failings	1
distinguishing	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
contrast	1
himself	1
with	1
them	1
moreover	1
although	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
closest	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
as	1
farmer	1
and	1
arbitrator	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
more	1
as	1
adviser	1
the	1
peasants	1
trusted	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
thirty	1
miles	1
round	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
advice	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
definite	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
liked	1
them	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
peasantry	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
knew	1
men	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
watching	1
and	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
people	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
peasants	1
whom	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
good	1
and	1
interesting	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
observing	1
new	1
points	1
in	1
them	1
altering	1
his	1
former	1
views	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
forming	1
new	1
ones	1
with	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
and	1
praised	1
a	1
country	1
life	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
so	1
too	1
he	1
liked	1
the	1
peasantry	1
in	1
contradistinction	1
to	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
and	1
so	1
too	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
peasantry	1
as	1
something	1
distinct	1
from	1
and	1
opposed	1
to	1
men	1
generally	1
in	1
his	1
methodical	1
brain	1
there	1
were	1
distinctly	1
formulated	1
certain	1
aspects	1
of	1
peasant	1
life	1
deduced	1
partly	1
from	1
that	1
life	1
itself	1
but	1
chiefly	1
from	1
contrast	1
with	1
other	1
modes	1
of	1
life	1
he	1
never	1
changed	1
his	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
peasantry	1
and	1
his	1
sympathetic	1
attitude	1
towards	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
discussions	1
that	1
arose	1
between	1
the	1
brothers	1
on	1
their	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
peasantry	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
always	1
got	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
precisely	1
because	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
had	1
definite	1
ideas	1
about	1
the	1
peasant	1
his	1
character	1
his	1
qualities	1
and	1
his	1
tastes	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
had	1
no	1
definite	1
and	1
unalterable	1
idea	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
their	1
arguments	1
konstantin	1
was	1
readily	1
convicted	1
of	1
contradicting	1
himself	1
in	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
was	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
with	1
his	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
place	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
it	1
in	1
french	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
mind	1
which	1
though	1
fairly	1
quick	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
influenced	1
by	1
the	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
and	1
consequently	1
filled	1
with	1
contradictions	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
condescension	1
of	1
an	1
elder	1
brother	1
he	1
sometimes	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
true	1
import	1
of	1
things	1
but	1
he	1
derived	1
little	1
satisfaction	1
from	1
arguing	1
with	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
got	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
him	1
too	1
easily	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
regarded	1
his	1
brother	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
immense	1
intellect	1
and	1
culture	1
as	1
generous	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
special	1
faculty	1
for	1
working	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
the	1
older	1
he	1
became	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
intimately	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
brother	1
the	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
the	1
thought	1
struck	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
faculty	1
of	1
working	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
utterly	1
devoid	1
was	1
possibly	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
quality	1
as	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
something	1
not	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
good	1
honest	1
noble	1
desires	1
and	1
tastes	1
but	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
vital	1
force	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
impulse	1
which	1
drives	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
choose	1
someone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
paths	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
to	1
care	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
the	1
better	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
brother	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
people	1
who	1
worked	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
welfare	1
were	1
not	1
led	1
by	1
an	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
but	1
reasoned	1
from	1
intellectual	1
considerations	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
right	1
thing	1
to	1
take	1
interest	1
in	1
public	1
affairs	1
and	1
consequently	1
took	1
interest	1
in	1
them	1
levin	1
was	1
confirmed	1
in	1
this	1
generalization	1
by	1
observing	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
questions	1
affecting	1
the	1
public	1
welfare	1
or	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
immortality	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
a	1
bit	1
more	1
to	1
heart	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
chess	1
problems	1
or	1
the	1
ingenious	1
construction	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
machine	1
besides	1
this	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
his	1
ease	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
because	1
in	1
summer	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
levin	1
was	1
continually	1
busy	1
with	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
summer	1
day	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
enough	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
while	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
taking	1
a	1
holiday	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
a	1
holiday	1
now	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
no	1
writing	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
that	1
he	1
liked	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
concise	1
and	1
eloquent	1
shape	1
the	1
ideas	1
that	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
someone	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
most	1
usual	1
and	1
natural	1
listener	1
was	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
so	1
in	1

liked	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
on	1

to	1
lie	1

what	1
a	1

this	1

not	1
an	1

konstantin	1
levin	1
found	1
it	1
dull	1
sitting	1

listening	1
to	1
him	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
while	1

they	1
would	1
be	1
carting	1

not	1
ploughed	1
ready	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
heaping	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
anyhow	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
screw	1
the	1
shares	1
in	1
the	1
ploughs	1
but	1
would	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
off	1
and	1
then	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
ploughs	1
were	1
a	1
silly	1
invention	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1

if	1
the	1

were	1
properly	1
laid	1
out	1
to	1

impossible	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
square	1
miles	1
of	1
our	1
district	1
what	1
with	1
our	1
thaws	1
and	1
the	1

and	1
the	1
work	1
in	1

i	1
don	1

how	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1

medical	1

all	1
over	1
and	1
besides	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
medicine	1
oh	1
well	1
that	1
s	1
unfair	1
i	1
can	1
quote	1
to	1
you	1
thousands	1
of	1
instances	1
but	1
the	1
schools	1
anyway	1
why	1
have	1
schools	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
two	1
opinions	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
education	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
a	1

for	1

a	1

for	1
everyone	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
felt	1
himself	1
morally	1
pinned	1
against	1
a	1
wall	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
got	1
hot	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
blurted	1
out	1
the	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
indifference	1
to	1
public	1
business	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
all	1
be	1
very	1
good	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
i	1
worry	1
myself	1
about	1
establishing	1
dispensaries	1
which	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
and	1
schools	1
to	1
which	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
send	1
my	1
children	1
to	1
which	1
even	1
the	1
peasants	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
send	1
their	1
children	1

to	1
which	1
i	1
ve	1
no	1
very	1
firm	1
faith	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
said	1
he	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
surprised	1
at	1
this	1
unexpected	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
he	1
promptly	1
made	1
a	1
new	1
plan	1
of	1
attack	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
hook	1
threw	1
it	1
in	1
again	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
smiling	1
come	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1

for	1

oh	1
well	1
but	1
i	1
fancy	1
her	1
wrist	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
straight	1
again	1
that	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
proved	1
next	1
the	1
peasant	1
who	1
can	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
workman	1
of	1
more	1
use	1
and	1
value	1
to	1
you	1
no	1
you	1
can	1
ask	1
anyone	1
you	1
like	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
answered	1
with	1
decision	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
can	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
is	1
much	1
inferior	1
as	1
a	1
workman	1
and	1
mending	1
the	1
highroads	1
is	1
an	1
impossibility	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
put	1
up	1
bridges	1
they	1
re	1
stolen	1
still	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
point	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
frowning	1
he	1
disliked	1
contradiction	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
arguments	1
that	1
were	1
continually	1
skipping	1
from	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
another	1
introducing	1
new	1
and	1
disconnected	1
points	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
knowing	1
to	1
which	1
to	1
reply	1
do	1
you	1
admit	1
that	1
education	1
is	1
a	1
benefit	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
yes	1
i	1
admit	1
it	1
said	1
levin	1
without	1
thinking	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
immediately	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
admitted	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
meaningless	1
rubbish	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
proved	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
inevitably	1
be	1
logically	1
proved	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
proofs	1
the	1
argument	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
simpler	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
if	1
you	1
admit	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
benefit	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
then	1
as	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
you	1
cannot	1
help	1
caring	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
sympathizing	1
with	1
the	1
movement	1
and	1
so	1
wishing	1
to	1
work	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
still	1
do	1
not	1
admit	1
this	1
movement	1
to	1
be	1
just	1

my	1

shall	1
always	1
defend	1
to	1
the	1

tell	1
you	1
what	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
flying	1
off	1
again	1
to	1
a	1
subject	1
quite	1
beside	1
the	1

all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it	1

in	1
the	1

itself	1

over	1
these	1
birch	1
branches	1

believe	1
in	1
them	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
wonder	1
how	1
the	1
birch	1
branches	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
their	1
argument	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
really	1
understand	1
at	1
once	1
what	1
his	1
brother	1
meant	1
excuse	1
me	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
one	1
really	1
can	1
t	1
argue	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
he	1
observed	1
but	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
wanted	1
to	1
justify	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
failing	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
lack	1
of	1
zeal	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
welfare	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
imagine	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
activity	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
lasting	1

at	1

that	1
what	1

was	1
unintelligible	1
to	1

only	1
he	1
could	1

up	1
his	1

this	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
previous	1
year	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
mowing	1
and	1
being	1
made	1
very	1
angry	1
by	1
the	1
bailiff	1
he	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
his	1
favorite	1
means	1
for	1
regaining	1
his	1
temper	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
scythe	1
from	1
a	1
peasant	1
and	1
began	1
mowing	1
he	1
liked	1
the	1
work	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
tried	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
mowing	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
cut	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
this	1
year	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
early	1
spring	1
he	1
had	1
cherished	1
a	1
plan	1
for	1
mowing	1
for	1
whole	1
days	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
ever	1
since	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
arrival	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
doubt	1
whether	1
to	1
mow	1
or	1
not	1
he	1
was	1
loath	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
brother	1
alone	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
his	1
brother	1
would	1
laugh	1
at	1
him	1
about	1
it	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
drove	1
into	1
the	1
meadow	1
and	1
recalled	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
mowing	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
deciding	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
mowing	1
after	1
the	1
irritating	1
discussion	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
pondered	1
over	1
this	1
intention	1
again	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
physical	1
exercise	1
or	1
my	1
temper	1
ll	1
certainly	1
be	1
ruined	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
he	1
determined	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
mowing	1
however	1
awkward	1
he	1
might	1
feel	1
about	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
or	1
the	1
peasants	1
towards	1
evening	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
counting	1
house	1
gave	1
directions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
sent	1
about	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
summon	1
the	1
mowers	1
for	1
the	1
morrow	1
to	1
cut	1
the	1
hay	1
in	1
kalinov	1
meadow	1
the	1
largest	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
grass	1

send	1

for	1
him	1
to	1

it	1
and	1

it	1
round	1
tomorrow	1
i	1
shall	1
maybe	1
do	1
some	1
mowing	1
myself	1
too	1

said	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
embarrassed	1
the	1
bailiff	1
smiled	1
and	1
said	1
yes	1

at	1
tea	1
the	1
same	1
evening	1

to	1
his	1
brother	1

the	1
fine	1

ivanovitch	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1

with	1
interest	1
at	1

do	1
you	1

at	1
their	1

of	1

at	1
the	1

forty	1

were	1
mowing	1
slowly	1
over	1
the	1
uneven	1
low	1

for	1
the	1

would	1
not	1

to	1
keep	1
it	1
up	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
he	1
swung	1
his	1
scythe	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
strength	1
and	1
was	1
making	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
ask	1
tit	1
to	1
stop	1

at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
tit	1
stopped	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
and	1
stooping	1
down	1
picked	1
up	1
some	1
grass	1

his	1
scythe	1

began	1
whetting	1
it	1

himself	1
and	1
drawing	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
looked	1
round	1

a	1
peasant	1

he	1
too	1
was	1
evidently	1
tired	1
for	1
he	1
stopped	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
mow	1
up	1
to	1
levin	1

began	1
whetting	1
his	1
scythe	1

they	1

on	1
the	1

moved	1
on	1
with	1

of	1
his	1
scythe	1
not	1
stopping	1

signs	1
of	1
weariness	1

followed	1
him	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1

left	1
behind	1

he	1
found	1
it	1
harder	1
and	1
harder	1
the	1
moment	1
came	1
when	1

felt	1
he	1
had	1
no	1

left	1

at	1
that	1

row	1
and	1
this	1
long	1
row	1
seemed	1
particularly	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
levin	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
reached	1
and	1
tit	1
shouldering	1
his	1
scythe	1
began	1
with	1
deliberate	1
stride	1
returning	1
on	1
the	1
tracks	1
left	1
by	1
his	1
heels	1
in	1
the	1
cut	1
grass	1
and	1
levin	1
walked	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
over	1
the	1
space	1
he	1
had	1
cut	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
sweat	1
that	1
ran	1
in	1
streams	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
fell	1
in	1
drops	1
down	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
drenched	1
his	1
back	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
soaked	1
in	1
water	1
he	1
felt	1
very	1
happy	1
what	1
delighted	1
him	1
particularly	1
was	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
out	1
his	1
pleasure	1
was	1
only	1
disturbed	1
by	1
his	1
row	1
not	1
being	1
well	1
cut	1
i	1
will	1
swing	1
less	1
with	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
more	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
body	1
he	1
thought	1
comparing	1
tit	1
s	1
row	1
which	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
with	1
a	1
line	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
unevenly	1
and	1
irregularly	1
lying	1
grass	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
as	1
levin	1
noticed	1
tit	1
had	1
mowed	1
specially	1
quickly	1
probably	1
wishing	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
the	1
test	1
and	1
the	1
row	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
long	1
one	1
the	1
next	1
rows	1
were	1
easier	1
but	1
still	1
levin	1
had	1
to	1
strain	1
every	1
nerve	1
not	1
to	1
drop	1
behind	1
the	1
peasants	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
behind	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
work	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
possible	1
he	1
heard	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
swish	1
of	1
scythes	1
and	1
saw	1
before	1
him	1
tit	1
s	1
upright	1
figure	1
mowing	1
away	1
the	1
crescent	1
shaped	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
cut	1
grass	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
flower	1
heads	1
slowly	1
and	1
rhythmically	1
falling	1
before	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
his	1
scythe	1
and	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
row	1
where	1
would	1
come	1
the	1
rest	1
suddenly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
toil	1
without	1
understanding	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
or	1
whence	1
it	1
came	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
pleasant	1
sensation	1
of	1
chill	1
on	1
his	1
hot	1
moist	1
shoulders	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
in	1
the	1
interval	1
for	1
whetting	1
the	1
scythes	1
a	1
heavy	1
lowering	1
storm	1
cloud	1
had	1
blown	1
up	1
and	1
big	1
raindrops	1
were	1
falling	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
coats	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
others	1
just	1
like	1
levin	1
himself	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
their	1
shoulders	1
enjoying	1
the	1
pleasant	1
coolness	1
of	1
it	1
another	1
row	1
and	1
yet	1
another	1
row	1
followed	1
long	1
rows	1
and	1
short	1
rows	1
with	1
good	1
grass	1
and	1
with	1
poor	1
grass	1
levin	1
lost	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
told	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
or	1
early	1
now	1
a	1
change	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
over	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
immense	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
toil	1
there	1
were	1
moments	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
forgot	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
all	1
easy	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
those	1
same	1
moments	1
his	1
row	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
smooth	1
and	1
well	1
cut	1
as	1
tit	1
s	1
but	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
recollected	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
began	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
better	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
conscious	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
his	1
task	1
and	1
the	1
row	1
was	1
badly	1
mown	1
on	1
finishing	1
yet	1
another	1
row	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
again	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
next	1
but	1
tit	1
stopped	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
both	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
talking	1
about	1
and	1
why	1
doesn	1
t	1
he	1
go	1
back	1
thought	1
levin	1
not	1
guessing	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
been	1
mowing	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
four	1
hours	1
without	1
stopping	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
for	1
their	1
lunch	1
lunch	1
sir	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
it	1
really	1
time	1
that	1
s	1
right	1
lunch	1
then	1
levin	1
gave	1
his	1
scythe	1
to	1
tit	1
and	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
were	1
crossing	1
the	1
long	1
stretch	1
of	1
mown	1
grass	1
slightly	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
rain	1
to	1
get	1
their	1
bread	1
from	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
coats	1
he	1
went	1
towards	1
his	1
house	1
only	1
then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
awoke	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
wrong	1
about	1
the	1
weather	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
drenching	1
his	1
hay	1
the	1
hay	1
will	1
be	1
spoiled	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
it	1
sir	1
mow	1
in	1
the	1
rain	1
and	1
you	1
ll	1
rake	1
in	1
fine	1
weather	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
levin	1
untied	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
coffee	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
getting	1
up	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
his	1
coffee	1
levin	1
rode	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
mowing	1
before	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
chapter	1
5	1
after	1
lunch	1
levin	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
mowers	1
as	1
before	1
but	1
stood	1
between	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
accosted	1
him	1
jocosely	1
and	1
now	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
neighbor	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
peasant	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
married	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
mowing	1
this	1
summer	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
holding	1
himself	1
erect	1
moved	1
in	1
front	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
turned	1
out	1
taking	1
long	1
regular	1
strides	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
precise	1
and	1
regular	1
action	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
cost	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
effort	1
than	1
swinging	1
one	1
s	1
arms	1
in	1
walking	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
play	1
he	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
high	1
even	1
row	1
of	1
grass	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
he	1
but	1
the	1
sharp	1
scythe	1
of	1
itself	1
swishing	1
through	1
the	1
juicy	1
grass	1
behind	1
levin	1
came	1
the	1
lad	1
mishka	1
his	1
pretty	1
boyish	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
twist	1
of	1
fresh	1
grass	1
bound	1
round	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
all	1
working	1
with	1
effort	1
but	1
whenever	1
anyone	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
smiled	1
he	1
would	1
clearly	1
have	1
died	1
sooner	1
than	1
own	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
work	1
for	1
him	1
levin	1
kept	1
between	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
mowing	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
such	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
perspiration	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
drenched	1
cooled	1
him	1
while	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
burned	1
his	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
bare	1
to	1
the	1
elbow	1
gave	1
a	1
vigor	1
and	1
dogged	1
energy	1
to	1
his	1
labor	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
now	1
came	1
those	1
moments	1
of	1
unconsciousness	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
one	1
was	1
doing	1
the	1
scythe	1
cut	1
of	1
itself	1
these	1
were	1
happy	1
moments	1
still	1
more	1
delightful	1
were	1
the	1
moments	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
stream	1
where	1
the	1
rows	1
ended	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
rubbed	1
his	1
scythe	1
with	1
the	1
wet	1
thick	1
grass	1
rinsed	1
its	1
blade	1
in	1
the	1
fresh	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
ladled	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
a	1
tin	1
dipper	1
and	1
offered	1
levin	1
a	1
drink	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
my	1
home	1
brew	1
eh	1
good	1
eh	1
said	1
he	1
winking	1
and	1
truly	1
levin	1
had	1
never	1
drunk	1
any	1
liquor	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
this	1
warm	1
water	1
with	1
green	1
bits	1
floating	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
rust	1
from	1
the	1
tin	1
dipper	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
this	1
came	1
the	1
delicious	1
slow	1
saunter	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
scythe	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
wipe	1
away	1
the	1
streaming	1
sweat	1
take	1
deep	1
breaths	1
of	1
air	1
and	1
look	1
about	1
at	1
the	1
long	1
string	1
of	1
mowers	1
and	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
around	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
the	1
longer	1
levin	1
mowed	1
the	1
oftener	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
moments	1
of	1
unconsciousness	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
seemed	1
not	1
his	1
hands	1
that	1
swung	1
the	1
scythe	1
but	1
the	1
scythe	1
mowing	1
of	1
itself	1
a	1
body	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
consciousness	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
magic	1
without	1
thinking	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
work	1
turned	1
out	1
regular	1
and	1
well	1
finished	1
of	1
itself	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
blissful	1
moments	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
hard	1
work	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
the	1
motion	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
unconscious	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
mow	1
round	1
a	1
hillock	1
or	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
sorrel	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
did	1
this	1
easily	1
when	1
a	1
hillock	1
came	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
action	1
and	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
heel	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
with	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
scythe	1
clipped	1
the	1
hillock	1
round	1
both	1
sides	1
with	1
short	1
strokes	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
he	1
kept	1
looking	1
about	1
and	1
watching	1
what	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
view	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
he	1
picked	1
a	1
wild	1
berry	1
and	1
ate	1
it	1
or	1
offered	1
it	1
to	1
levin	1
then	1
he	1
flung	1
away	1
a	1
twig	1
with	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
the	1
scythe	1
then	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
quail	1
s	1
nest	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
bird	1
flew	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
scythe	1
or	1
caught	1
a	1
snake	1
that	1
crossed	1
his	1
path	1
and	1
lifting	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
scythe	1
as	1
though	1
on	1
a	1
fork	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
levin	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
away	1
for	1
both	1
levin	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
peasant	1
behind	1
him	1
such	1
changes	1
of	1
position	1
were	1
difficult	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
repeating	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
the	1
same	1
strained	1
movement	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
perfect	1
frenzy	1
of	1
toil	1
and	1
were	1
incapable	1
of	1
shifting	1
their	1
position	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
watching	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
them	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
how	1
time	1
was	1
passing	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
how	1
long	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
working	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
on	1
for	1
dinner	1
time	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
back	1
over	1
the	1
cut	1
grass	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
called	1
levin	1
s	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girls	1
and	1
boys	1
who	1
were	1
coming	1
from	1
different	1
directions	1
hardly	1
visible	1
through	1
the	1
long	1
grass	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
towards	1
the	1
mowers	1
carrying	1
sacks	1
of	1
bread	1
dragging	1
at	1
their	1
little	1
hands	1
and	1
pitchers	1
of	1
the	1
sour	1
rye	1
beer	1
with	1
cloths	1
wrapped	1
round	1
them	1
look	1
ee	1
the	1
little	1
emmets	1
crawling	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
shaded	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
they	1
mowed	1
two	1
more	1
rows	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
stopped	1
come	1
master	1
dinner	1
time	1
he	1
said	1
briskly	1
and	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
stream	1
the	1
mowers	1
moved	1
off	1
across	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
cut	1
grass	1
towards	1
their	1
pile	1
of	1
coats	1
where	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
their	1
dinners	1
were	1
sitting	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
the	1
peasants	1
gathered	1
into	1
groups	1
those	1
further	1
away	1
under	1
a	1
cart	1
those	1
nearer	1
under	1
a	1
willow	1
bush	1
levin	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
them	1
he	1
felt	1
disinclined	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
all	1
constraint	1
with	1
the	1
master	1
had	1
disappeared	1
long	1
ago	1
the	1
peasants	1
got	1
ready	1
for	1
dinner	1
some	1
washed	1
the	1

in	1

uncovered	1
the	1

the	1

man	1
crumbled	1
up	1
some	1

in	1

of	1

he	1
kneeling	1
down	1
before	1

the	1

was	1
so	1
good	1
that	1
levin	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
going	1
home	1
he	1
dined	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
family	1
affairs	1
taking	1
the	1
keenest	1
interest	1
in	1
them	1

told	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
own	1
affairs	1

all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
he	1
felt	1
much	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
affection	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
got	1
up	1
again	1
said	1
his	1
prayer	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
under	1
a	1
bush	1
putting	1
some	1
grass	1
under	1
his	1
head	1
for	1
a	1
pillow	1
levin	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
clinging	1
flies	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
persistent	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
the	1
midges	1
that	1
tickled	1
his	1
hot	1
face	1
and	1
body	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
only	1
waked	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bush	1
and	1
reached	1
him	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
awake	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
and	1
was	1
sitting	1
up	1
whetting	1
the	1
scythes	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
lads	1
levin	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
hardly	1
recognized	1

everything	1
was	1
so	1
changed	1
the	1
immense	1
stretch	1
of	1
meadow	1
had	1
been	1
mown	1
and	1
was	1
sparkling	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
fresh	1
brilliance	1
with	1
its	1
lines	1
of	1
already	1
sweet	1
smelling	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
slanting	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
bushes	1
about	1
the	1
river	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
river	1
itself	1
not	1
visible	1
before	1
now	1
gleaming	1
like	1
steel	1
in	1
its	1
bends	1
and	1
the	1
moving	1
ascending	1
peasants	1
and	1
the	1
sharp	1
wall	1
of	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
unmown	1
part	1
of	1
the	1

the	1

hovering	1
over	1
the	1
stripped	1
meadow	1
all	1
was	1
perfectly	1
new	1
raising	1
himself	1
levin	1
began	1
considering	1
how	1
much	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
done	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
work	1
done	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
much	1
for	1
forty	1
two	1
men	1
they	1
had	1
cut	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
meadow	1
which	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
serf	1
labor	1
taken	1
thirty	1
scythes	1
two	1
days	1
to	1
mow	1
only	1
the	1
corners	1
remained	1
to	1
do	1
where	1
the	1
rows	1
were	1
short	1
but	1
levin	1
felt	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
get	1
as	1
much	1
mowing	1
done	1
that	1
day	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
was	1
vexed	1
with	1
the	1
sun	1
sinking	1
so	1
quickly	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
he	1
felt	1
no	1
weariness	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
work	1
done	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
quickly	1

who	1

short	1

was	1
just	1
as	1
good	1
humored	1
jocose	1
and	1
free	1
in	1
his	1
movements	1
among	1
the	1

bent	1
down	1
every	1

came	1
across	1
a	1

picked	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
bosom	1
another	1
present	1
for	1
my	1
old	1
woman	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
easy	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
mow	1
the	1
wet	1
soft	1
grass	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1

going	1
up	1

down	1
the	1
steep	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1

this	1
did	1
not	1
trouble	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
swinging	1
his	1
scythe	1
just	1
as	1
ever	1
and	1
moving	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
their	1
big	1
plaited	1
shoes	1
with	1
firm	1
little	1
steps	1
he	1
climbed	1
slowly	1
up	1
the	1

though	1
his	1
breeches	1
hanging	1
out	1
below	1
his	1
smock	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
frame	1
trembled	1
with	1

he	1
did	1
not	1
miss	1
one	1
blade	1
of	1
grass	1
or	1
one	1
mushroom	1
on	1
his	1
way	1

with	1

levin	1
walked	1
after	1

often	1

he	1
must	1
fall	1
as	1
he	1
climbed	1
with	1
a	1
scythe	1
up	1
a	1
steep	1
cliff	1
where	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
clamber	1
without	1
anything	1

he	1
climbed	1
up	1
and	1
did	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1

never	1

at	1

the	1

it	1

to	1
levin	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1

he	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1

blissfully	1

was	1
about	1
i	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
partly	1
right	1
our	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
amounts	1
to	1
this	1
that	1
you	1
make	1

while	1
i	1
suppose	1

to	1

possibly	1
you	1
are	1
right	1

that	1

did	1
not	1

he	1

his	1

him	1
some	1

essential	1
official	1
duty	1
so	1
familiar	1
to	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1

that	1
duty	1

for	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
in	1

of	1
reminding	1
the	1

of	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
having	1
for	1
the	1

performance	1
of	1
this	1

taken	1
all	1

from	1

was	1
gaily	1
and	1
agreeably	1
spending	1
his	1
days	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
villas	1
meanwhile	1
dolly	1
and	1
the	1
children	1

moved	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
cut	1
down	1
expenses	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
ergushovo	1
the	1
estate	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
dowry	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
where	1
in	1

sold	1

the	1
big	1
old	1
house	1
at	1
ergushovo	1
had	1
been	1
pulled	1
down	1
long	1
ago	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
lodge	1
done	1
up	1
and	1
built	1
on	1
to	1
twenty	1
years	1
before	1
when	1
dolly	1
was	1
a	1
child	1
the	1
lodge	1
had	1
been	1
roomy	1

comfortable	1

lodges	1
it	1
stood	1
sideways	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1

faced	1
the	1
south	1

by	1
now	1
this	1
lodge	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
dilapidated	1
when	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
to	1
sell	1
the	1
forest	1
dolly	1
had	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
look	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
order	1
what	1
repairs	1
might	1
be	1
needed	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
like	1
all	1
unfaithful	1
husbands	1
indeed	1
was	1
very	1
solicitous	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
comfort	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
looked	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
given	1
instructions	1
about	1
everything	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
necessary	1
what	1
he	1
considered	1
necessary	1
was	1
to	1
cover	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
with	1
cretonne	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
curtains	1
to	1
weed	1
the	1

to	1
make	1
a	1
little	1
bridge	1
on	1
the	1
pond	1
and	1
to	1
plant	1
flowers	1
but	1
he	1
forgot	1
many	1
other	1
essential	1
matters	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
which	1
greatly	1
distressed	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
later	1
on	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
efforts	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
attentive	1
father	1
and	1
husband	1
he	1
never	1
could	1
keep	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
he	1
had	1
bachelor	1
tastes	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
shaped	1
his	1
life	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
moscow	1
he	1
informed	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
pride	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
ready	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
paradise	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
advised	1
her	1
most	1
certainly	1
to	1
go	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
staying	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
very	1
agreeable	1
to	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
it	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
good	1

decreased	1
expenses	1
and	1
it	1
left	1
him	1
more	1
at	1
liberty	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
regarded	1
staying	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
the	1
summer	1
as	1
essential	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
especially	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
succeeded	1
in	1
regaining	1
her	1
strength	1
after	1
the	1
scarlatina	1
and	1
also	1
as	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
escaping	1
the	1
petty	1
humiliations	1
the	1
little	1
bills	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
wood	1
merchant	1
the	1
fishmonger	1
the	1
shoemaker	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
miserable	1
besides	1
this	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
dreaming	1
of	1
getting	1
her	1
sister	1
kitty	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
her	1
there	1
kitty	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
from	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
and	1
bathing	1
had	1
been	1
prescribed	1
for	1
her	1
kitty	1
wrote	1
that	1
no	1
prospect	1
was	1
so	1
alluring	1
as	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
summer	1
with	1
dolly	1
at	1
ergushovo	1
full	1
of	1
childish	1
associations	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
were	1
very	1
hard	1
for	1
dolly	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
the	1
impression	1
she	1
had	1
retained	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
a	1
refuge	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
unpleasantness	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
that	1
life	1
there	1
though	1
not	1
luxurious	1
dolly	1
could	1
easily	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
that	1
was	1
cheap	1
and	1
comfortable	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
plenty	1
of	1
everything	1
everything	1
was	1
cheap	1
everything	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
and	1
children	1
were	1
happy	1
but	1
now	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
she	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
fancied	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
their	1
arrival	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
heavy	1
fall	1
of	1
rain	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
water	1
came	1
through	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
beds	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
kitchen	1
maid	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
the	1
nine	1
cows	1
it	1
appeared	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
cowherd	1
woman	1
that	1
some	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
calve	1
others	1
had	1
just	1

others	1
were	1
old	1
and	1
others	1
again	1
hard	1
uddered	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
butter	1
nor	1
milk	1
enough	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
eggs	1
they	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
fowls	1
old	1
purplish	1
stringy	1

all	1
they	1
had	1
for	1

impossible	1
to	1

to	1

the	1

out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
because	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
was	1
restive	1
and	1
bolted	1
in	1
the	1
shafts	1
there	1

no	1
place	1
where	1
they	1

strayed	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
through	1
a	1
gap	1
in	1

there	1
was	1

alexandrovna	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
in	1
despair	1
she	1
exerted	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
felt	1
the	1
hopelessness	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
and	1
was	1
every	1
instant	1
suppressing	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
started	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
the	1
bailiff	1
a	1
retired	1
quartermaster	1
whom	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
and	1
had	1
appointed	1
bailiff	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
handsome	1
and	1
respectful	1
appearance	1
as	1
a	1
hall	1
porter	1
showed	1
no	1
sympathy	1
for	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
woes	1
he	1
said	1
respectfully	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
the	1
peasants	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
wretched	1
lot	1
and	1
did	1
nothing	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
the	1
position	1
seemed	1
hopeless	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
oblonskys	1
household	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
families	1
indeed	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
inconspicuous	1
but	1
most	1
valuable	1
and	1
useful	1
person	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
she	1
soothed	1
her	1
mistress	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
come	1
round	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
expression	1
and	1
matvey	1
had	1
borrowed	1
it	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
without	1
fuss	1
or	1
hurry	1
proceeded	1
to	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
herself	1
she	1
had	1
immediately	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
the	1
bailiff	1
s	1
wife	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
day	1
she	1
drank	1
tea	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
bailiff	1
under	1
the	1
acacias	1
and	1
reviewed	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
very	1
soon	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
had	1
established	1
her	1
club	1
so	1
to	1
say	1
under	1
the	1
acacias	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
club	1
consisting	1
of	1
the	1
bailiff	1
s	1
wife	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
and	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
that	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
existence	1
were	1
gradually	1
smoothed	1
away	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
week	1
s	1
time	1
everything	1
actually	1
had	1
come	1
round	1
the	1
roof	1
was	1
mended	1
a	1
kitchen	1
maid	1
was	1
found	1
a	1
crony	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
s	1
hens	1
were	1
bought	1
the	1
cows	1
began	1
giving	1
milk	1
the	1

was	1
stopped	1
up	1
with	1
stakes	1
the	1
carpenter	1
made	1
a	1
mangle	1
hooks	1
were	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
cupboards	1
and	1
they	1
ceased	1
to	1
burst	1
open	1
spontaneously	1
and	1
an	1
ironing	1
board	1
covered	1
with	1
army	1
cloth	1
was	1
placed	1
across	1
from	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
to	1
the	1
chest	1
of	1
drawers	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
flatirons	1
in	1
the	1
maids	1
room	1
just	1
see	1
now	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
quite	1
in	1
despair	1
said	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
ironing	1
board	1
they	1
even	1
rigged	1
up	1
a	1
bathing	1
shed	1
of	1
straw	1
hurdles	1
lily	1
began	1
to	1
bathe	1
and	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
began	1
to	1
realize	1
if	1
only	1
in	1
part	1
her	1
expectations	1
if	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
peaceful	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
a	1
comfortable	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
peaceful	1
with	1
six	1
children	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
one	1
would	1
fall	1
ill	1
another	1
might	1
easily	1
become	1
so	1
a	1
third	1
would	1
be	1
without	1
something	1
necessary	1
a	1
fourth	1
would	1
show	1
symptoms	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
disposition	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
rare	1
indeed	1
were	1
the	1
brief	1
periods	1
of	1
peace	1
but	1
these	1
cares	1
and	1
anxieties	1
were	1
for	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
the	1
sole	1
happiness	1
possible	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
them	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
left	1
alone	1
to	1
brood	1
over	1
her	1
husband	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
besides	1
hard	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
mother	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
illness	1
the	1
illnesses	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
grief	1
of	1
seeing	1
signs	1
of	1
evil	1
propensities	1
in	1
her	1
children	1
the	1
children	1
themselves	1
were	1
even	1
now	1
repaying	1
her	1
in	1
small	1
joys	1
for	1
her	1
sufferings	1
those	1
joys	1
were	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
they	1
passed	1
unnoticed	1
like	1
gold	1
in	1
sand	1
and	1
at	1
bad	1
moments	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
pain	1
nothing	1
but	1
sand	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
good	1
moments	1
too	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
joy	1
nothing	1
but	1
gold	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
aware	1
of	1
those	1
joys	1
often	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
every	1
possible	1
effort	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
mistaken	1
that	1
she	1
as	1
a	1
mother	1
was	1
partial	1
to	1
her	1
children	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
charming	1
children	1
all	1
six	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
different	1
ways	1
but	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
children	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
happy	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
proud	1
of	1
them	1

begging	1
her	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
not	1

of	1
everything	1
before	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1

down	1
at	1

the	1
sunday	1
in	1
st	1

s	1
week	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
drove	1
to	1
mass	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
children	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
sacrament	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
in	1
her	1
intimate	1
philosophical	1
talks	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
friends	1
very	1
often	1
astonished	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
her	1
views	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
religion	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
strange	1
religion	1
of	1
transmigration	1
of	1
souls	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
firm	1
faith	1
troubling	1
herself	1
little	1
about	1
the	1
dogmas	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
family	1
she	1
was	1
strict	1
in	1
carrying	1
out	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
required	1
by	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
not	1
merely	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
sacrament	1
for	1
nearly	1
a	1
year	1
worried	1
her	1
extremely	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
full	1
approval	1
and	1
sympathy	1
of	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
she	1
decided	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
before	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
was	1
busily	1
deliberating	1
on	1
how	1
to	1
dress	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
frocks	1
were	1
made	1
or	1
altered	1
and	1
washed	1
seams	1
and	1
flounces	1
were	1
let	1
out	1
buttons	1
were	1
sewn	1
on	1
and	1
ribbons	1
got	1
ready	1
one	1
dress	1
tanya	1
s	1
which	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
had	1
undertaken	1
cost	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
much	1
loss	1
of	1
temper	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
in	1
altering	1
it	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
seams	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
place	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
sleeves	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
altogether	1
spoilt	1
the	1
dress	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
narrow	1
on	1
tanya	1
s	1
shoulders	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
painful	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
but	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
had	1
the	1
happy	1
thought	1
of	1
putting	1
in	1
gussets	1
and	1
adding	1
a	1
little	1
shoulder	1
cape	1
the	1
dress	1
was	1
set	1
right	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nearly	1
a	1
quarrel	1
with	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
however	1
all	1
was	1
happily	1
arranged	1
and	1
towards	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
time	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
priest	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
mass	1
the	1
children	1
in	1
their	1
new	1
dresses	1
with	1
beaming	1
faces	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
before	1
the	1
carriage	1
waiting	1
for	1
their	1
mother	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
restive	1
raven	1
they	1
had	1
harnessed	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
representations	1
of	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
the	1
bailiff	1
s	1
horse	1
brownie	1
and	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
delayed	1
by	1
anxiety	1
over	1
her	1
own	1
attire	1
came	1
out	1
and	1
got	1
in	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
muslin	1
gown	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
dressed	1
with	1
care	1
and	1
excitement	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
she	1
had	1
dressed	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
sake	1
to	1
look	1
pretty	1
and	1
be	1
admired	1
later	1
on	1
as	1
she	1
got	1
older	1
dress	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
distasteful	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
losing	1
her	1
good	1
looks	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
pleasure	1
and	1
interest	1
in	1
dress	1
again	1
now	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
dress	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
sake	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
beauty	1
but	1
simply	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
those	1
exquisite	1
creatures	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
spoil	1
the	1
general	1
effect	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
herself	1
she	1
looked	1
nice	1
not	1
nice	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
wished	1
to	1
look	1
nice	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
at	1
a	1
ball	1
but	1
nice	1
for	1
the	1
object	1
which	1
she	1
now	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
the	1
peasants	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
their	1
women	1
folk	1
but	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
saw	1
or	1
fancied	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
sensation	1
produced	1
by	1
her	1
children	1
and	1
her	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
beautiful	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
in	1
their	1
smart	1
little	1
dresses	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
charming	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
behaved	1
aliosha	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
did	1
not	1
stand	1
quite	1
correctly	1
he	1
kept	1
turning	1
round	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
little	1
jacket	1
from	1
behind	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
was	1
wonderfully	1
sweet	1
tanya	1
behaved	1
like	1
a	1
grown	1
up	1
person	1
and	1
looked	1
after	1
the	1
little	1
ones	1
and	1
the	1
smallest	1
lily	1
was	1
bewitching	1
in	1
her	1
naïve	1
astonishment	1
at	1
everything	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
not	1
to	1
smile	1
when	1
after	1
taking	1
the	1
sacrament	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
english	1
please	1
some	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
home	1
the	1
children	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
solemn	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
were	1
very	1
sedate	1
everything	1
went	1
happily	1
at	1
home	1
too	1
but	1
at	1
lunch	1
grisha	1
began	1
whistling	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
worse	1
was	1
disobedient	1
to	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
and	1
was	1
forbidden	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
tart	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
let	1
things	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
day	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
present	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
s	1
authority	1
and	1
she	1
upheld	1
her	1
decision	1
that	1
grisha	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
tart	1
this	1
rather	1
spoiled	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
humor	1
grisha	1
cried	1
declaring	1
that	1
nikolinka	1
had	1
whistled	1
too	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
punished	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
wasn	1
t	1
crying	1
for	1
the	1
tart	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
care	1
but	1
at	1
being	1
unjustly	1
treated	1
this	1
was	1
really	1
too	1
tragic	1
and	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
to	1
forgive	1
grisha	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
beheld	1
a	1
scene	1
filling	1
her	1
heart	1
with	1
such	1
pleasure	1
that	1
the	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
forgave	1
the	1
delinquent	1
herself	1
the	1
culprit	1

a	1
roar	1
of	1

delight	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
floated	1
across	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1

it	1
was	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
restrain	1
their	1
wild	1
pranks	1
though	1
it	1
was	1

too	1
to	1
keep	1

not	1

up	1
all	1
the	1

who	1
had	1
always	1
liked	1
bathing	1
herself	1
and	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
enjoyed	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
bathing	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
all	1
those	1
fat	1
little	1
legs	1
pulling	1
on	1
their	1
stockings	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
dip	1
those	1
little	1
naked	1
bodies	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
their	1
screams	1
of	1
delight	1
and	1
alarm	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
breathless	1
faces	1
with	1
wide	1
open	1
scared	1
and	1
happy	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
splashing	1
cherubs	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
pleasure	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
half	1
the	1
children	1
had	1
been	1
dressed	1
some	1
peasant	1
women	1
in	1
holiday	1
dress	1
out	1
picking	1
herbs	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bathing	1
shed	1
and	1
stopped	1
shyly	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
handed	1
her	1
a	1
sheet	1
and	1
a	1
shirt	1
that	1
had	1
dropped	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
dry	1
them	1
and	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
women	1
at	1
first	1
they	1
laughed	1
behind	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
her	1
questions	1
but	1
soon	1
they	1
grew	1
bolder	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
winning	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
heart	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
the	1
genuine	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1

that	1
they	1
showed	1
my	1
what	1
a	1
beauty	1
as	1

it	1
s	1
our	1
custom	1
for	1
three	1
fasts	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
became	1
most	1
interesting	1
to	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
time	1
did	1
she	1
have	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
the	1
boy	1
where	1
was	1
her	1

it	1
often	1
happen	1

alexandrovna	1
felt	1
disinclined	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
peasant	1
women	1
so	1
interesting	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
their	1
conversation	1
so	1
completely	1
identical	1
were	1
all	1
their	1
interests	1
what	1
pleased	1
her	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
clearly	1
what	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
admired	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
was	1
her	1
having	1
so	1
many	1
children	1
and	1
such	1
fine	1
ones	1
the	1
peasant	1
women	1
even	1
made	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
laugh	1
and	1
offended	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
laughter	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
women	1
kept	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
englishwoman	1
who	1
was	1
dressing	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
third	1
petticoat	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
the	1
remark	1
my	1
she	1
keeps	1
putting	1
on	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
and	1
she	1

round	1

alexandrovna	1
peeped	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
when	1
she	1
recognized	1
in	1
the	1
gray	1
hat	1
and	1
gray	1
coat	1
the	1
familiar	1
figure	1
of	1
levin	1
walking	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
specially	1
glad	1
he	1
should	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
glory	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
appreciate	1
her	1
grandeur	1
than	1
levin	1
seeing	1
her	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pictures	1
of	1
his	1
daydream	1
of	1

life	1
you	1

darya	1
alexandrovna	1
ah	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
to	1

she	1
said	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
but	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
my	1
brother	1
s	1
staying	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
stiva	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
here	1
from	1
stiva	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
asked	1
with	1
surprise	1
yes	1
he	1
writes	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
thinks	1
you	1
might	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
levin	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
he	1
became	1
suddenly	1
embarrassed	1
and	1
stopping	1
abruptly	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
in	1
silence	1
by	1
the	1
wagonette	1
snapping	1
off	1
the	1
buds	1
of	1
the	1
lime	1
trees	1
and	1
nibbling	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
embarrassed	1
through	1
a	1
sense	1
that	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
would	1
be	1
annoyed	1
by	1
receiving	1
from	1
an	1
outsider	1
help	1
that	1
should	1
by	1
rights	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
husband	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
this	1
little	1
way	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
of	1
foisting	1
his	1
domestic	1
duties	1
on	1
others	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
aware	1
that	1
levin	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
for	1
this	1
fineness	1
of	1
perception	1
for	1
this	1
delicacy	1
that	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
liked	1
levin	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
course	1
said	1
levin	1
that	1
that	1
simply	1
means	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
though	1
i	1
can	1
fancy	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
town	1
housekeeping	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
must	1
feel	1
in	1

dolly	1
at	1

things	1
were	1
rather	1
uncomfortable	1
but	1
now	1
we	1

settled	1
everything	1
capitally	1
thanks	1
to	1
my	1
old	1
nurse	1

said	1
indicating	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
who	1
seeing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
her	1
smiled	1
brightly	1
and	1
cordially	1
to	1
levin	1
she	1
knew	1
him	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
match	1
for	1
her	1
young	1
lady	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
keen	1
to	1
see	1
the	1

to	1
race	1
the	1
horses	1
with	1
me	1
the	1
children	1
knew	1
levin	1
very	1
little	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
but	1
they	1
experienced	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
him	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
shyness	1
and	1
hostility	1
which	1
children	1
so	1
often	1
experience	1
towards	1
hypocritical	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
and	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
often	1
and	1
miserably	1
punished	1
hypocrisy	1
in	1
anything	1
whatever	1
may	1
deceive	1
the	1
cleverest	1
and	1
most	1
penetrating	1
man	1
but	1
the	1
least	1
wide	1
awake	1
of	1
children	1
recognizes	1
it	1
and	1
is	1
revolted	1
by	1
it	1
however	1
ingeniously	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
disguised	1
whatever	1
faults	1
levin	1
had	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
children	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
friendliness	1
that	1
they	1
saw	1
in	1
their	1
mother	1
s	1
face	1
on	1
his	1
invitation	1
the	1
two	1
elder	1
ones	1
at	1
once	1
jumped	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
simply	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
their	1
nurse	1
or	1
miss	1
hoole	1
or	1
their	1
mother	1
lily	1
too	1
began	1
begging	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
handed	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
sat	1

on	1

said	1
smiling	1
good	1
humoredly	1
to	1
the	1
mother	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
my	1
hurting	1
or	1
dropping	1

and	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
strong	1
agile	1
assiduously	1
careful	1
and	1
needlessly	1
wary	1
movements	1
the	1
mother	1
felt	1
her	1
mind	1
at	1
rest	1
and	1
smiled	1
gaily	1
and	1
approvingly	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
him	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
with	1

and	1
with	1
darya	1

with	1

with	1
him	1
of	1
childlike	1
light	1
heartedness	1
that	1
she	1
particularly	1
liked	1
in	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
gymnastic	1
feats	1
set	1
miss	1
hoole	1
laughing	1
with	1
his	1
queer	1
english	1
accent	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
of	1
his	1
pursuits	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
after	1
dinner	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
sitting	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
balcony	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
kitty	1
you	1
know	1
kitty	1
s	1
coming	1
here	1
and	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
summer	1
with	1
me	1
really	1
he	1
said	1
flushing	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
said	1
then	1
i	1
ll	1
send	1
you	1
two	1
cows	1
shall	1
i	1
if	1
you	1
insist	1
on	1
a	1
bill	1
you	1
shall	1
pay	1
me	1
five	1
roubles	1
a	1
month	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
really	1
too	1
bad	1
of	1
you	1
no	1
thank	1
you	1
we	1
can	1
manage	1
very	1
well	1
now	1
oh	1
well	1
then	1
i	1
ll	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
your	1
cows	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
ll	1
allow	1
me	1
i	1
ll	1
give	1
directions	1
about	1
their	1
food	1
everything	1
depends	1
on	1
their	1
food	1
and	1
levin	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
conversation	1
explained	1
to	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
cow	1
keeping	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
the	1
cow	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
machine	1
for	1
the	1
transformation	1
of	1
food	1
into	1
milk	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
he	1
talked	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
passionately	1
longed	1
to	1
hear	1
more	1
of	1
kitty	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
hearing	1
it	1
he	1
dreaded	1
the	1
breaking	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
inward	1
peace	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
with	1
such	1
effort	1
yes	1
but	1
still	1
all	1
this	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
after	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
it	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
responded	1
without	1
interest	1
she	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
got	1
her	1
household	1
matters	1
so	1
satisfactorily	1
arranged	1
thanks	1
to	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
disinclined	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
them	1
besides	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
faith	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
knowledge	1
of	1
farming	1
general	1
principles	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
cow	1
being	1
a	1
machine	1
for	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
milk	1
she	1
looked	1
on	1
with	1
suspicion	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
such	1
principles	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
a	1
hindrance	1
in	1
farm	1
management	1
it	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
far	1
simpler	1
matter	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
needed	1
as	1
marya	1
philimonovna	1
had	1
explained	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
brindle	1
and	1
whitebreast	1
more	1
food	1
and	1
drink	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
cook	1
carry	1
all	1
the	1
kitchen	1
slops	1
to	1
the	1
laundry	1
maid	1
s	1
cow	1
that	1
was	1
clear	1
but	1
general	1
propositions	1
as	1
to	1
feeding	1
on	1
meal	1
and	1
on	1
grass	1
were	1
doubtful	1
and	1
obscure	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
most	1
important	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
kitty	1
chapter	1
10	1
kitty	1
writes	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
she	1
longs	1
for	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
quiet	1
and	1
solitude	1
dolly	1
said	1
after	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
had	1
followed	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
better	1
levin	1
asked	1
in	1
agitation	1
thank	1
god	1
she	1
s	1
quite	1
well	1
again	1
i	1
never	1
believed	1
her	1
lungs	1
were	1
affected	1
oh	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
said	1
levin	1
and	1
dolly	1
fancied	1
she	1
saw	1
something	1
touching	1
helpless	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
and	1
looked	1
silently	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
let	1
me	1
ask	1
you	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
said	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
smiling	1
her	1
kindly	1
and	1
rather	1
mocking	1
smile	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
angry	1
with	1
kitty	1
i	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
her	1
said	1
levin	1
yes	1
you	1
are	1
angry	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
nor	1
them	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
moscow	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
he	1
said	1
blushing	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
his	1
hair	1
i	1
wonder	1
really	1
that	1
with	1
your	1
kind	1
heart	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
feel	1
this	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
feel	1
no	1
pity	1
for	1
me	1
if	1
nothing	1
else	1
when	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
do	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
made	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
refused	1
said	1
levin	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
tenderness	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
feeling	1
for	1
kitty	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
anger	1
for	1
the	1
slight	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
what	1
makes	1
you	1
suppose	1
i	1
know	1
because	1
everybody	1
knows	1
it	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
though	1
i	1
had	1
guessed	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
now	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
all	1
i	1
knew	1
was	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
dreadfully	1
miserable	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
begged	1
me	1
never	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
she	1
would	1
certainly	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
anyone	1
else	1
but	1
what	1
did	1
pass	1
between	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
when	1
was	1
it	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
at	1
their	1
house	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
said	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
i	1
am	1
awfully	1
awfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
you	1
suffer	1
only	1
from	1
pride	1
perhaps	1
so	1
said	1
levin	1
but	1
she	1
interrupted	1
him	1
but	1
she	1
poor	1
girl	1
i	1
am	1
awfully	1
awfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
now	1
i	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
well	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
good	1
bye	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
till	1
we	1
meet	1
again	1
no	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
she	1
said	1
clutching	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
sit	1
down	1
please	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
feeling	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
stir	1
within	1
his	1
heart	1
a	1
hope	1
he	1
had	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
know	1
you	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
dead	1
revived	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
heart	1
yes	1
i	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
now	1
said	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
for	1
you	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
free	1
and	1
make	1
your	1
own	1
choice	1
it	1
s	1
always	1
clear	1
whom	1
you	1
love	1
but	1
a	1
girl	1
s	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
of	1
suspense	1
with	1
all	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
or	1
maiden	1
s	1
modesty	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
sees	1
you	1
men	1
from	1
afar	1
who	1
takes	1
everything	1
on	1
trust	1
a	1
girl	1
may	1
have	1
and	1
often	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
cannot	1
tell	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
yes	1
if	1
the	1
heart	1
does	1
not	1
speak	1
no	1
the	1
heart	1
does	1
speak	1
but	1
just	1
consider	1
you	1
men	1
have	1
views	1
about	1
a	1
girl	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
you	1
make	1
friends	1
you	1
criticize	1
you	1
wait	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
found	1
what	1
you	1
love	1
and	1
then	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
sure	1
you	1
love	1
her	1
you	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
well	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
quite	1
it	1
anyway	1
you	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
when	1
your	1
love	1
is	1
ripe	1
or	1
when	1
the	1
balance	1
has	1
completely	1
turned	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
you	1
are	1
choosing	1
from	1
but	1
a	1
girl	1
is	1
not	1
asked	1
she	1
is	1
expected	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
choice	1
and	1
yet	1
she	1
cannot	1
choose	1
she	1
can	1
only	1
answer	1
yes	1
or	1
no	1
yes	1
to	1
choose	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
vronsky	1
thought	1
levin	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
thing	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
life	1
within	1
him	1
died	1
again	1
and	1
only	1
weighed	1
on	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
aching	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
s	1
how	1
one	1
chooses	1
a	1
new	1
dress	1
or	1
some	1
purchase	1
or	1
other	1
not	1
love	1
the	1
choice	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
and	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
repeating	1
it	1
ah	1
pride	1
pride	1
said	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
as	1
though	1
despising	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
baseness	1
of	1
this	1
feeling	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
that	1
other	1
feeling	1
which	1
only	1
women	1
know	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
made	1
kitty	1
an	1
offer	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
doubt	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
vronsky	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
seeing	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
you	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
supposing	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
older	1
i	1
for	1
instance	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
could	1
have	1
felt	1
no	1
doubt	1
i	1
always	1
disliked	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
has	1
turned	1
out	1
levin	1
recalled	1
kitty	1
s	1
answer	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
no	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
he	1
said	1
dryly	1
i	1
appreciate	1
your	1
confidence	1
in	1
me	1
i	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
making	1
a	1
mistake	1
but	1
whether	1
i	1
am	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
that	1
pride	1
you	1
so	1
despise	1
makes	1
any	1
thought	1
of	1
katerina	1
alexandrovna	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
me	1
you	1
understand	1
utterly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
i	1
will	1
only	1
say	1
one	1
thing	1
more	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
speaking	1
of	1
my	1
sister	1
whom	1
i	1
love	1
as	1
i	1
love	1
my	1
own	1
children	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
she	1
cared	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
i	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
her	1
refusal	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
proves	1
nothing	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
said	1
levin	1
jumping	1
up	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
how	1
you	1
are	1
hurting	1
me	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
yours	1
were	1
dead	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
like	1
this	1
and	1
like	1
that	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
lived	1
and	1
how	1
happy	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
s	1
dead	1
dead	1
dead	1
how	1
absurd	1
you	1
are	1
said	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
looking	1
with	1
mournful	1
tenderness	1
at	1
levin	1
s	1
excitement	1
yes	1
i	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
clearly	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
musingly	1
so	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
then	1
when	1
kitty	1
s	1
here	1
no	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1
come	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
katerina	1
alexandrovna	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
i	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
save	1
her	1
the	1
annoyance	1
of	1
my	1
presence	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
very	1
absurd	1
repeated	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
looking	1
with	1
tenderness	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
very	1
well	1
then	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
this	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
for	1
tanya	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
french	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
where	1
s	1
my	1
spade	1
mamma	1
i	1
speak	1
french	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
too	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
in	1
french	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
french	1
for	1
spade	1
the	1
mother	1
prompted	1
her	1
and	1
then	1
told	1
her	1
in	1
french	1
where	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
spade	1
and	1
this	1
made	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
on	1
levin	1
everything	1
in	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
children	1
struck	1
him	1
now	1
as	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
charming	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
before	1
and	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
talk	1
french	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
how	1
unnatural	1
and	1
false	1
it	1
is	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
feel	1
it	1
so	1
learning	1
french	1

in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
july	1
the	1
elder	1
of	1
the	1

on	1
levin	1
s	1
sister	1
s	1
estate	1
about	1
fifteen	1
miles	1
from	1
pokrovskoe	1
came	1
to	1
levin	1
to	1
report	1
on	1
how	1
things	1
were	1
going	1
there	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
hay	1
the	1
chief	1
source	1
of	1
income	1
on	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
estate	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
riverside	1
meadows	1
in	1
former	1
years	1
the	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
bought	1
by	1
the	1
peasants	1
for	1
twenty	1
roubles	1
the	1
three	1
acres	1
when	1
levin	1
took	1
over	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
he	1
thought	1
on	1
examining	1
the	1
grasslands	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
worth	1
more	1
and	1
he	1
fixed	1
the	1
price	1
at	1
twenty	1
five	1
roubles	1
the	1
three	1
acres	1
the	1
peasants	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
that	1
price	1
and	1
as	1
levin	1
suspected	1
kept	1
off	1
other	1
purchasers	1
then	1
levin	1
had	1
driven	1
over	1
himself	1
and	1
arranged	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
grass	1
cut	1
partly	1
by	1
hired	1
labor	1
partly	1
at	1
a	1
payment	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
crop	1
his	1
own	1
peasants	1
put	1
every	1
hindrance	1
they	1
could	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
arrangement	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
the	1
meadows	1
had	1
yielded	1
a	1
profit	1
almost	1
double	1
the	1
previous	1
year	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
maintained	1
the	1
same	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
arrangement	1
and	1
the	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
system	1
this	1
year	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
doing	1
all	1
the	1
mowing	1
for	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
hay	1
crop	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
had	1
come	1
now	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
the	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
and	1
that	1
fearing	1
rain	1
they	1
had	1
invited	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
over	1
had	1
divided	1
the	1
crop	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
had	1
raked	1
together	1
eleven	1
stacks	1
as	1
the	1
owner	1
s	1
share	1
from	1
the	1
vague	1
answers	1
to	1
his	1
question	1
how	1
much	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
on	1
the	1
principal	1
meadow	1
from	1
the	1
hurry	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
division	1
not	1
asking	1
leave	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
tone	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
levin	1
perceived	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
wrong	1
in	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
hay	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
drive	1
over	1
himself	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
matter	1
arriving	1
for	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
leaving	1
his	1
horse	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wet	1
nurse	1
levin	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
bee	1
house	1
wanting	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
truth	1
about	1
the	1
hay	1
parmenitch	1
a	1
talkative	1
comely	1
old	1
man	1
gave	1
levin	1
a	1
very	1
warm	1
welcome	1
showed	1
him	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
about	1
his	1
bees	1
and	1
the	1
swarms	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
but	1
gave	1
vague	1
and	1
unwilling	1
answers	1
to	1
levin	1
s	1
inquiries	1
about	1
the	1
mowing	1
this	1
confirmed	1
levin	1
still	1
more	1
in	1
his	1
suspicions	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
hay	1
fields	1
and	1
examined	1
the	1
stacks	1
the	1
haystacks	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
contain	1
fifty	1
wagon	1
loads	1
each	1
and	1
to	1
convict	1
the	1
peasants	1
levin	1
ordered	1
the	1
wagons	1
that	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
hay	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
up	1
directly	1
to	1
lift	1
one	1
stack	1
and	1
carry	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
barn	1
there	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
only	1
thirty	1
two	1
loads	1
in	1
the	1
stack	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
s	1
assertions	1
about	1
the	1
compressibility	1
of	1
hay	1
and	1
its	1
having	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
stacks	1
and	1
his	1
swearing	1
that	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
god	1
levin	1
stuck	1
to	1
his	1
point	1
that	1
the	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
divided	1
without	1
his	1
orders	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
accept	1
that	1
hay	1
as	1
fifty	1
loads	1
to	1
a	1
stack	1
after	1
a	1
prolonged	1
dispute	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
decided	1
by	1
the	1
peasants	1
taking	1
these	1
eleven	1
stacks	1
reckoning	1
them	1
as	1
fifty	1
loads	1
each	1
the	1
arguments	1
and	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
haycocks	1
lasted	1
the	1
whole	1
afternoon	1
when	1
the	1
last	1
of	1

down	1
on	1
a	1

marked	1
off	1
by	1
a	1
stake	1
of	1

at	1

the	1

being	1
rapidly	1
formed	1
into	1

over	1
the	1

from	1

growing	1
up	1

up	1
in	1

broke	1
into	1
a	1
song	1

it	1
alone	1
through	1
a	1
verse	1

then	1
the	1

verse	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1

repeated	1
by	1
half	1
a	1

to	1

down	1

seemed	1
to	1
be	1
shaking	1

singing	1
to	1
the	1

of	1
this	1

song	1
with	1
its	1

envious	1
of	1

to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
this	1
joy	1
of	1
life	1

he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1

had	1
to	1
lie	1
and	1
look	1
on	1
and	1
listen	1
when	1
the	1
peasants	1
with	1
their	1

vanished	1
out	1
of	1

alienation	1

over	1

some	1
of	1
the	1

in	1
the	1

unobserved	1

all	1

the	1

together	1
over	1

the	1

sounds	1
of	1
the	1

that	1
never	1
ceased	1
in	1

up	1
from	1

of	1

life	1
of	1
his	1
utterly	1

this	1
renunciation	1
gave	1
him	1
satisfaction	1

was	1
easy	1

simple	1
another	1

of	1

would	1
find	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
content	1
the	1
peace	1

the	1
dignity	1
of	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1

he	1
was	1
so	1
miserably	1
conscious	1

a	1
third	1

of	1

upon	1

imperceptibly	1
too	1
my	1

went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
and	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
highroad	1
towards	1
the	1
village	1
a	1
slight	1
wind	1
arose	1
and	1
the	1
sky	1
looked	1
gray	1
and	1
sullen	1
the	1
gloomy	1
moment	1
had	1
come	1
that	1
usually	1
precedes	1
the	1
dawn	1
the	1
full	1
triumph	1
of	1
light	1
over	1
darkness	1
shrinking	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
levin	1
walked	1
rapidly	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
ground	1
what	1
s	1
that	1
someone	1
coming	1
he	1
thought	1
catching	1
the	1
tinkle	1
of	1
bells	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
forty	1
paces	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
carriage	1
with	1
four	1
horses	1
harnessed	1
abreast	1
was	1
driving	1
towards	1
him	1
along	1
the	1
grassy	1
road	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
walking	1
the	1
shaft	1

were	1
tilted	1
against	1
the	1
shafts	1
by	1
the	1
ruts	1

the	1
dexterous	1
driver	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
held	1
the	1
shaft	1
over	1
the	1
ruts	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wheels	1
ran	1
on	1
the	1
smooth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
levin	1
noticed	1
and	1
without	1
wondering	1
who	1

could	1
be	1

gazed	1
absently	1
at	1
the	1
coach	1
in	1
the	1

was	1
an	1
old	1
lady	1
dozing	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
evidently	1
only	1
just	1
awake	1
sat	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
holding	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
the	1
ribbons	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
full	1
of	1
light	1
and	1
thought	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
subtle	1
complex	1
inner	1
life	1
that	1
was	1
remote	1
from	1
levin	1
she	1
was	1
gazing	1
beyond	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
sunrise	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
when	1
this	1
apparition	1
was	1
vanishing	1
the	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
she	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
wondering	1
delight	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
other	1
eyes	1
like	1
those	1
in	1
the	1

there	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
could	1
concentrate	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
brightness	1
and	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1

was	1

understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
driving	1
to	1
ergushovo	1
from	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
stirring	1
levin	1
during	1
that	1
sleepless	1
night	1
all	1
the	1
resolutions	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
all	1
vanished	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
recalled	1
with	1
horror	1
his	1
dreams	1
of	1
marrying	1
a	1
peasant	1
girl	1
there	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
had	1
crossed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
was	1
rapidly	1
disappearing	1
there	1
only	1
could	1
he	1
find	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
riddle	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
which	1
had	1
weighed	1
so	1
agonizingly	1
upon	1
him	1
of	1
late	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
out	1
again	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1

was	1
no	1
longer	1
audible	1

scarcely	1
be	1

barking	1
of	1

the	1

reached	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
was	1
the	1
empty	1
fields	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
village	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
isolated	1
and	1
apart	1
from	1
it	1
all	1
wandering	1
lonely	1
along	1
the	1
deserted	1
highroad	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
expecting	1
to	1
find	1
there	1
the	1
cloud	1
shell	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
admiring	1
and	1
taking	1
as	1
the	1
symbol	1
of	1
the	1
ideas	1
and	1
feelings	1
of	1
that	1
night	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1

been	1
accomplished	1
there	1
was	1
no	1

there	1
was	1
stretched	1
over	1
fully	1
half	1
the	1

an	1
even	1
cover	1
of	1
tiny	1
and	1
ever	1
tinier	1
cloudlets	1
the	1

grown	1
blue	1

bright	1
and	1
with	1
the	1

softness	1

with	1
the	1

remoteness	1

met	1
his	1
questioning	1

cry	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
when	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
races	1
anna	1
had	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
vronsky	1
and	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
had	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
fury	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
against	1
her	1
was	1
aware	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
of	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
that	1
emotional	1
disturbance	1
always	1
produced	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
tears	1
conscious	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
conscious	1
that	1
any	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
feelings	1
at	1
that	1
minute	1
would	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
position	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
suppress	1
every	1
manifestation	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
himself	1
and	1
so	1
neither	1
stirred	1
nor	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
had	1
caused	1
that	1
strange	1
expression	1
of	1
deathlike	1
rigidity	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
impressed	1
anna	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
helped	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
master	1
himself	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
urbanity	1
and	1
uttered	1
that	1
phrase	1
that	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
nothing	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
his	1
decision	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
words	1
confirming	1
his	1
worst	1
suspicions	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1
cruel	1
pang	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
that	1
pang	1
was	1
intensified	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
physical	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
set	1
up	1
by	1
her	1
tears	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
and	1
delight	1
felt	1
complete	1
relief	1
both	1
from	1
this	1
pity	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
doubts	1
and	1
agonies	1
of	1
jealousy	1
he	1
experienced	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
tooth	1
out	1
after	1
suffering	1
long	1
from	1
toothache	1
after	1
a	1
fearful	1
agony	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
something	1
huge	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
head	1
itself	1
being	1
torn	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
jaw	1
the	1
sufferer	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
good	1
luck	1
feels	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
what	1
has	1
so	1
long	1
poisoned	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
enchained	1
his	1
attention	1
exists	1
no	1
longer	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
live	1
and	1
think	1
again	1
and	1
take	1
interest	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
besides	1
his	1
tooth	1
this	1
feeling	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
experiencing	1
the	1
agony	1
had	1
been	1
strange	1
and	1
terrible	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
live	1
again	1
and	1
think	1
of	1
something	1
other	1
than	1
his	1
wife	1
no	1
honor	1
no	1
heart	1
no	1
religion	1
a	1
corrupt	1
woman	1
i	1
always	1
knew	1
it	1
and	1
always	1
saw	1
it	1
though	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
deceive	1
myself	1
to	1
spare	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
it	1
actually	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
he	1
recalled	1
incidents	1
of	1
their	1
past	1
life	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
anything	1
wrong	1
before	1
now	1
these	1
incidents	1
proved	1
clearly	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
corrupt	1
woman	1
i	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
linking	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
hers	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
wrong	1
in	1
my	1
mistake	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
cannot	1
be	1
unhappy	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
i	1
that	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
but	1
she	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
for	1
me	1
everything	1
relating	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
towards	1
whom	1
his	1
sentiments	1
were	1
as	1
much	1
changed	1
as	1
towards	1
her	1
ceased	1
to	1
interest	1
him	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
now	1
was	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
he	1
could	1
best	1
with	1
most	1
propriety	1
and	1
comfort	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
thus	1
with	1
most	1
justice	1
extricate	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
mud	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
spattered	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
fall	1
and	1
then	1
proceed	1
along	1
his	1
path	1
of	1
active	1
honorable	1
and	1
useful	1
existence	1
i	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
unhappy	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
a	1
contemptible	1
woman	1
has	1
committed	1
a	1
crime	1
i	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
find	1
the	1

way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
difficult	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
has	1
placed	1
me	1

the	1

never	1

a	1

felt	1

for	1

indeed	1
this	1
was	1
not	1

and	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
sympathy	1
for	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
frequently	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
instances	1
of	1
unfaithful	1
wives	1
betraying	1
their	1
husbands	1
the	1
more	1
highly	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
himself	1

is	1
a	1
misfortune	1
which	1
may	1
befall	1
anyone	1
and	1
this	1
misfortune	1
has	1
befallen	1
me	1
the	1

thing	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
is	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
passing	1
in	1
review	1
the	1
methods	1
of	1
proceeding	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
daryalov	1
fought	1
a	1
duel	1
the	1
duel	1
had	1
particularly	1
fascinated	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
in	1
his	1
youth	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
physically	1
a	1
coward	1
and	1
was	1
himself	1
well	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
could	1
not	1
without	1
horror	1
contemplate	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
pistol	1
aimed	1
at	1
himself	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
any	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
this	1
horror	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
youth	1
set	1
him	1
pondering	1
on	1
dueling	1
and	1
picturing	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
expose	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
danger	1
having	1
attained	1
success	1
and	1
an	1
established	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
forgotten	1
this	1
feeling	1
but	1
the	1
habitual	1
bent	1
of	1
feeling	1
reasserted	1
itself	1
and	1
dread	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
cowardice	1
proved	1
even	1
now	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
spent	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
thinking	1
over	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
dueling	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
aspects	1
and	1
hugging	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
duel	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
fully	1
aware	1
beforehand	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
fight	1
one	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
doubt	1
our	1
society	1
is	1
still	1
so	1
barbarous	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
england	1
that	1
very	1
many	1
and	1
among	1
these	1
were	1
those	1
whose	1
opinion	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
particularly	1
valued	1
look	1
favorably	1
on	1
the	1
duel	1

attained	1
by	1
it	1

alexey	1

on	1
to	1
himself	1

the	1
night	1

would	1
spend	1
after	1
the	1

and	1
the	1

killed	1
him	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
dispel	1
such	1
silly	1
ideas	1
what	1
sense	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
murdering	1
a	1
man	1
in	1

to	1
define	1
one	1

relation	1
to	1
a	1
guilty	1
wife	1

should	1
still	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
have	1
to	1
decide	1
what	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1

what	1
is	1
more	1
probable	1
and	1
what	1
would	1
doubtless	1
occur	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
killed	1

i	1
the	1
innocent	1

should	1
be	1

s	1
even	1
more	1
senseless	1
but	1
apart	1
from	1
that	1
a	1
challenge	1
to	1

would	1
be	1
an	1
act	1
hardly	1
honest	1
on	1
my	1
side	1

well	1
that	1
my	1
friends	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1

the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
statesman	1
needed	1
by	1
russia	1
to	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
danger	1

well	1
beforehand	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1

to	1
safeguard	1

pursuit	1
of	1
my	1

had	1
always	1
been	1
of	1
great	1
consequence	1
in	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
of	1
special	1
importance	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
considering	1
and	1
rejecting	1
the	1
duel	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
turned	1
to	1
divorce	1
another	1
solution	1
selected	1
by	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
husbands	1
he	1
remembered	1
passing	1
in	1
mental	1
review	1
all	1
the	1
instances	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
divorces	1
there	1
were	1
plenty	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
highest	1
society	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
familiar	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
single	1
example	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
divorce	1
was	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
instances	1
the	1
husband	1
had	1
practically	1
ceded	1
or	1
sold	1
his	1
unfaithful	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
party	1
which	1
being	1
in	1
fault	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
contract	1
a	1
fresh	1
marriage	1
had	1
formed	1
counterfeit	1
pseudo	1
matrimonial	1
ties	1
with	1
a	1
self	1
styled	1
husband	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
case	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
legal	1
divorce	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
one	1
in	1
which	1
only	1
the	1
guilty	1
wife	1
would	1
be	1
repudiated	1
was	1
impossible	1
of	1
attainment	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
complex	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
they	1
led	1
made	1
the	1
coarse	1
proofs	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
guilt	1
required	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
refinement	1
in	1
that	1
life	1
would	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
such	1
proofs	1
being	1
brought	1
forward	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
bring	1
forward	1
such	1
proofs	1
would	1
damage	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
estimation	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
would	1
her	1
an	1
attempt	1
at	1
divorce	1
could	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
public	1
scandal	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
perfect	1
godsend	1
to	1
his	1
enemies	1
for	1
calumny	1
and	1
attacks	1
on	1
his	1
high	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
his	1
chief	1
object	1
to	1
define	1
the	1
position	1
with	1
the	1
least	1
amount	1
of	1
disturbance	1
possible	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
attained	1
by	1
divorce	1
either	1
moreover	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
divorce	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
divorce	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
the	1
wife	1
broke	1
off	1
all	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
threw	1
in	1
her	1
lot	1
with	1
the	1
lover	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
complete	1
as	1
he	1
supposed	1
contempt	1
and	1
indifference	1
he	1
now	1
felt	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
still	1
had	1
one	1
feeling	1
left	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
disinclination	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
free	1
to	1
throw	1
in	1
her	1
lot	1
with	1
vronsky	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
crime	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
her	1
advantage	1
the	1
mere	1
notion	1
of	1
this	1
so	1
exasperated	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
that	1
directly	1
it	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
he	1
groaned	1
with	1
inward	1
agony	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
changed	1
his	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
after	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
scowling	1
brows	1
wrapping	1
his	1
numbed	1
and	1
bony	1
legs	1
in	1
the	1
fleecy	1
rug	1
apart	1
from	1
formal	1
divorce	1
one	1
might	1
still	1
do	1
like	1
karibanov	1
paskudin	1
and	1
that	1
good	1
fellow	1
dram	1
that	1
is	1
separate	1
from	1
one	1
s	1
wife	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
thinking	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
regained	1
his	1
composure	1
but	1
this	1
step	1
too	1
presented	1
the	1
same	1
drawback	1
of	1
public	1
scandal	1
as	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
more	1
a	1
separation	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
regular	1
divorce	1
flung	1
his	1
wife	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
vronsky	1
no	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
twisting	1
his	1
rug	1
about	1
him	1
again	1
i	1
cannot	1
be	1
unhappy	1
but	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
jealousy	1
which	1
had	1
tortured	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
uncertainty	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
the	1
tooth	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
agony	1
extracted	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
words	1
but	1
that	1
feeling	1
had	1
been	1
replaced	1
by	1
another	1
the	1
desire	1
not	1
merely	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
triumphant	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
get	1
due	1
punishment	1
for	1
her	1
crime	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
this	1
feeling	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
longed	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
having	1
destroyed	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
his	1
honor	1
and	1
going	1
once	1
again	1
over	1
the	1
conditions	1
inseparable	1
from	1
a	1
duel	1
a	1
divorce	1
a	1
separation	1
and	1
once	1
again	1
rejecting	1
them	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
felt	1
convinced	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
solution	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
with	1
him	1
concealing	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
using	1
every	1
measure	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
the	1
intrigue	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
though	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
to	1
himself	1
to	1
punish	1
her	1
i	1
must	1
inform	1
her	1
of	1
my	1
conclusion	1
that	1
thinking	1
over	1
the	1
terrible	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
has	1
placed	1
her	1
family	1
all	1
other	1
solutions	1
will	1
be	1
worse	1
for	1
both	1
sides	1
than	1
an	1
external	1
status	1
quo	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
i	1
agree	1
to	1
retain	1
on	1
the	1
strict	1
condition	1
of	1
obedience	1
on	1
her	1
part	1
to	1
my	1
wishes	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
cessation	1
of	1
all	1
intercourse	1
with	1
her	1
lover	1
when	1
this	1
decision	1
had	1
been	1
finally	1
adopted	1
another	1
weighty	1
consideration	1
occurred	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
course	1
only	1
shall	1
i	1
be	1
acting	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
religion	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
in	1
adopting	1
this	1
course	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
casting	1
off	1
a	1
guilty	1
wife	1
but	1
giving	1
her	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
amendment	1
and	1
indeed	1
difficult	1
as	1
the	1
task	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
devote	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
energies	1
to	1
her	1
reformation	1
and	1
salvation	1
though	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
perfectly	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
exert	1
any	1
moral	1
influence	1
over	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
attempt	1
at	1
reformation	1
could	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
falsity	1
though	1
in	1
passing	1
through	1
these	1
difficult	1
moments	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
thought	1
of	1
seeking	1
guidance	1
in	1
religion	1
yet	1
now	1
when	1
his	1
conclusion	1
corresponded	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
requirements	1
of	1
religion	1
this	1
religious	1
sanction	1
to	1
his	1
decision	1
gave	1
him	1
complete	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
restored	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
important	1
crisis	1
in	1
life	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
acted	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
that	1
religion	1
whose	1
banner	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
held	1
aloft	1
amid	1
the	1
general	1
coolness	1
and	1
indifference	1
as	1
he	1
pondered	1
over	1
subsequent	1
developments	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
indeed	1
why	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
should	1
not	1
remain	1
practically	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
before	1
no	1
doubt	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
regain	1
his	1
esteem	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
and	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
reason	1
that	1
his	1
existence	1
should	1
be	1
troubled	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
suffer	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
and	1
faithless	1
wife	1
yes	1
time	1
will	1
pass	1
time	1
which	1
arranges	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
relations	1
will	1
be	1
reestablished	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
told	1
himself	1
so	1
far	1
reestablished	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
sensible	1
of	1
a	1
break	1
in	1
the	1
continuity	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
she	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
unhappy	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
cannot	1
be	1
unhappy	1

not	1

entirely	1
to	1
his	1

was	1

composing	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
letter	1

would	1

to	1
his	1

going	1
into	1
the	1
porter	1

room	1
alexey	1

glanced	1
at	1
the	1

papers	1
brought	1
from	1

directed	1
that	1

with	1
a	1
certain	1
pleasure	1
indicative	1

alexandrovitch	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
twice	1

stopped	1
at	1
an	1
immense	1
writing	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
six	1
candles	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
lighted	1
by	1
the	1

had	1
preceded	1
him	1

cracked	1
his	1
knuckles	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
sorting	1
out	1
his	1
writing	1
appurtenances	1
putting	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
thought	1
a	1
minute	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
write	1
without	1
pausing	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
he	1
wrote	1
without	1
using	1
any	1
form	1
of	1
address	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
wrote	1
in	1
french	1
making	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
plural	1
vous	1
which	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
note	1
of	1
coldness	1
as	1
the	1
corresponding	1
russian	1
form	1
at	1
our	1
last	1
conversation	1
i	1
notified	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
intention	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
decision	1

carefully	1

now	1
with	1
the	1

my	1

is	1
as	1
follows	1
whatever	1
your	1
conduct	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
consider	1
myself	1
justified	1
in	1
breaking	1
the	1
ties	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
by	1
a	1

power	1
the	1

cannot	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1

even	1
by	1
the	1

of	1
one	1

for	1
you	1

for	1
our	1
son	1
i	1
am	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
repented	1
and	1
do	1
repent	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
called	1
forth	1
the	1
present	1
letter	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
cooperate	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
eradicating	1
the	1

of	1
our	1

conjecture	1
what	1
awaits	1
you	1

your	1

this	1
i	1
hope	1
to	1
discuss	1
more	1
in	1
detail	1
in	1
a	1
personal	1
interview	1

he	1
read	1
the	1

through	1

felt	1
pleased	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
especially	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
remembered	1
to	1
enclose	1
money	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
harsh	1
word	1
not	1

it	1
in	1
an	1

to	1

for	1

the	1

over	1

painting	1
by	1
a	1
celebrated	1
artist	1
alexey	1

at	1

the	1
unfathomable	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
ironically	1
and	1
insolently	1
at	1
him	1
insufferably	1
insolent	1
and	1
challenging	1
was	1
the	1
effect	1
in	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
lace	1
about	1
the	1

after	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1

for	1
a	1
minute	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
shuddered	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
and	1
he	1
uttered	1
the	1
sound	1
brrr	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
easy	1
chair	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
book	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
read	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
revive	1
the	1
very	1
vivid	1
interest	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
before	1
in	1
egyptian	1
hieroglyphics	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
thought	1
of	1
something	1
else	1
he	1
thought	1
not	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
complication	1
that	1
had	1
arisen	1
in	1
his	1
official	1
life	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
constituted	1
the	1
chief	1
interest	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
penetrated	1
more	1
deeply	1
than	1
ever	1
before	1
into	1
this	1
intricate	1
affair	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
originated	1
a	1
leading	1
idea	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
it	1
without	1
self	1
flattery	1
calculated	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
to	1
strengthen	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
official	1
career	1
to	1
discomfit	1
his	1
enemies	1
and	1
thereby	1
to	1
be	1
of	1

greatest	1
benefit	1

happened	1
that	1
the	1
famous	1
commission	1
of	1
the	1
2nd	1
of	1
june	1
had	1
set	1
on	1
foot	1
an	1
inquiry	1
into	1
the	1
irrigation	1
of	1
lands	1
in	1
the	1
zaraisky	1
province	1
which	1
fell	1
under	1
alexey	1

s	1
department	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
glaring	1
example	1
of	1
fruitless	1
expenditure	1
and	1
paper	1
reforms	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
irrigation	1
of	1
these	1
lands	1
in	1
the	1
zaraisky	1
province	1
had	1
been	1
initiated	1
by	1
the	1
predecessor	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
predecessor	1
and	1
vast	1
sums	1
of	1
money	1
had	1
actually	1
been	1
spent	1
and	1
were	1
still	1
being	1
spent	1
on	1
this	1
business	1
and	1
utterly	1
unproductively	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
could	1
obviously	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
perceived	1
this	1
at	1
once	1
on	1
entering	1
office	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
board	1
of	1
irrigation	1
but	1
at	1
first	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
feel	1
secure	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
affect	1
too	1
many	1
interests	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
injudicious	1
later	1
on	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
engrossed	1
in	1
other	1
questions	1
and	1
had	1
simply	1
forgotten	1
the	1
board	1
of	1
irrigation	1
it	1
went	1
of	1
itself	1
like	1
all	1
such	1
boards	1
by	1
the	1
mere	1
force	1
of	1
inertia	1
many	1
people	1
gained	1
their	1
livelihood	1
by	1
the	1
board	1
of	1
irrigation	1
especially	1
one	1
highly	1
conscientious	1
and	1
musical	1
family	1
all	1
the	1
daughters	1
played	1
on	1
stringed	1
instruments	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
knew	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
had	1
stood	1
godfather	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elder	1
daughters	1
the	1
raising	1
of	1
this	1
question	1
by	1
a	1
hostile	1
department	1
was	1
in	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
opinion	1
a	1
dishonorable	1
proceeding	1
seeing	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
department	1
there	1
were	1
things	1
similar	1
and	1
worse	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
inquired	1
into	1
for	1
well	1
known	1
reasons	1
of	1
official	1
etiquette	1
however	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
glove	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
boldly	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
demanded	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
a	1
special	1
commission	1
to	1
investigate	1
and	1
verify	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
the	1
board	1
of	1
irrigation	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
in	1
the	1
zaraisky	1
province	1
but	1
in	1
compensation	1
he	1
gave	1
no	1
quarter	1
to	1
the	1
enemy	1
either	1
he	1
demanded	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
another	1
special	1
commission	1
to	1
inquire	1
into	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
organization	1
committee	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
incidentally	1
in	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
the	1
2nd	1
of	1
june	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
pressed	1
forward	1
actively	1
by	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
as	1
one	1
admitting	1
of	1
no	1
delay	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
deplorable	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
in	1
the	1
commission	1
this	1
question	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
ground	1
of	1
contention	1
between	1
several	1
departments	1
the	1
department	1
hostile	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
flourishing	1
that	1
the	1
proposed	1
reconstruction	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
their	1
prosperity	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
anything	1
wrong	1
it	1
arose	1
mainly	1
from	1
the	1
failure	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
department	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
measures	1
prescribed	1
by	1
law	1
now	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
intended	1
to	1
demand	1
first	1
that	1
a	1
new	1
commission	1
should	1
be	1
formed	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
empowered	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
secondly	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
appear	1
that	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
actually	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
official	1
documents	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
that	1
another	1
new	1
scientific	1
commission	1
should	1
be	1
appointed	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
deplorable	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1

5	1
material	1
and	1
6	1
religious	1
points	1
of	1
view	1
thirdly	1
that	1
evidence	1
should	1
be	1
required	1
from	1
the	1
rival	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
measures	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
ten	1
years	1
by	1
that	1
department	1
for	1
averting	1
the	1
disastrous	1
conditions	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
were	1
now	1
placed	1
and	1
fourthly	1
and	1
finally	1
that	1
that	1
department	1
explain	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
as	1
appeared	1
from	1

contravention	1
of	1

and	1
the	1

a	1
flash	1
of	1
eagerness	1
suffused	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
as	1
he	1
rapidly	1
wrote	1
out	1
a	1
synopsis	1
of	1
these	1
ideas	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
benefit	1
having	1
filled	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
rang	1
and	1
sent	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
certain	1
necessary	1
facts	1
for	1
him	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
frowned	1
and	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
after	1
reading	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
on	1
egyptian	1
hieroglyphics	1
and	1
renewing	1
his	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
at	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
recollecting	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
in	1
bed	1
the	1
incident	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
now	1
in	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
such	1
a	1
gloomy	1
light	1
chapter	1
15	1
though	1
anna	1
had	1
obstinately	1
and	1
with	1
exasperation	1
contradicted	1
vronsky	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
their	1
position	1
was	1
impossible	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
regarded	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
as	1
false	1
and	1
dishonorable	1
and	1
she	1
longed	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
soul	1
to	1
change	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
races	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
husband	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
excitement	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
agony	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
after	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
she	1
told	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
that	1
now	1
everything	1
was	1
made	1
clear	1
and	1
at	1
least	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
lying	1
and	1
deception	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
beyond	1
doubt	1
that	1
her	1
position	1
was	1
now	1
made	1
clear	1
forever	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
bad	1
this	1
new	1
position	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
clear	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
indefiniteness	1
or	1
falsehood	1
about	1
it	1
the	1
pain	1
she	1
had	1
caused	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
uttering	1
those	1
words	1
would	1
be	1
rewarded	1
now	1
by	1
everything	1
being	1
made	1
clear	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
evening	1
she	1
saw	1
vronsky	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
though	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
position	1
definite	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
when	1
she	1
woke	1
up	1
next	1
morning	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
rose	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
those	1
words	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
awful	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
now	1
how	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
brought	1
herself	1
to	1
utter	1
those	1
strange	1
coarse	1
words	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
spoken	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
i	1
saw	1
vronsky	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
turned	1
him	1
back	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
changed	1
my	1
mind	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
strange	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question	1
a	1
burning	1
blush	1
of	1
shame	1
spread	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
had	1
kept	1
her	1
from	1
it	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
ashamed	1
her	1
position	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
simplified	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
not	1
only	1
not	1
simple	1
but	1
as	1
absolutely	1
hopeless	1
she	1
felt	1
terrified	1
at	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
ever	1
thought	1
before	1
directly	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
husband	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
ideas	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
being	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
her	1
shame	1
being	1
proclaimed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
where	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
an	1
answer	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
vronsky	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
tired	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
offer	1
herself	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
bitter	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
had	1
continually	1
repeated	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
everyone	1
and	1
everyone	1
had	1
heard	1
them	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
look	1
those	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
household	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
maid	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
go	1
downstairs	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
governess	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
at	1
her	1
door	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
accord	1
anna	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
blushed	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
look	1
the	1
maid	1
begged	1
her	1
pardon	1
for	1
coming	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
fancied	1
the	1
bell	1
rang	1
she	1
brought	1
her	1
clothes	1
and	1
a	1
note	1
the	1
note	1
was	1
from	1
betsy	1
betsy	1
reminded	1
her	1
that	1
liza	1
merkalova	1
and	1
baroness	1
shtoltz	1
were	1
coming	1
to	1
play	1
croquet	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
morning	1
with	1
their	1
adorers	1
kaluzhsky	1

finished	1
anna	1
read	1
the	1
note	1
and	1
heaved	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
nothing	1
i	1

she	1
said	1
to	1
annushka	1
who	1
was	1
rearranging	1

brushes	1
on	1
the	1

annushka	1
went	1
out	1
but	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
dressing	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
hands	1
hanging	1
listlessly	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
shivered	1
all	1
over	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
some	1
gesture	1
utter	1
some	1
word	1
and	1
sank	1
back	1
into	1
lifelessness	1
again	1
she	1
repeated	1
continually	1
my	1
god	1
my	1
god	1
but	1
neither	1
god	1
nor	1
my	1
had	1
any	1
meaning	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
seeking	1
help	1
in	1
her	1
difficulty	1
in	1
religion	1
was	1
as	1
remote	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
seeking	1
help	1
from	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
himself	1
although	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
doubts	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
religion	1
was	1
possible	1
only	1
upon	1
condition	1
of	1
renouncing	1
what	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
simply	1
miserable	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
alarm	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
never	1
experienced	1
before	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
she	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
everything	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
double	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
just	1
as	1
objects	1
sometimes	1
appear	1
double	1
to	1
over	1
tired	1
eyes	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
at	1
times	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
feared	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
hoped	1
for	1
whether	1
she	1
feared	1
or	1
desired	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
or	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
and	1
exactly	1
what	1
she	1
longed	1
for	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
ah	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
doing	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
feeling	1
a	1
sudden	1
thrill	1
of	1
pain	1
in	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
her	1
hair	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
temples	1
and	1
pulling	1
it	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
coffee	1
is	1
ready	1
and	1
mademoiselle	1
and	1
seryozha	1
are	1
waiting	1
said	1
annushka	1
coming	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
finding	1
anna	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
seryozha	1
what	1
about	1
seryozha	1
anna	1
asked	1
with	1
sudden	1
eagerness	1
recollecting	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
existence	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
morning	1
he	1
s	1
been	1
naughty	1
i	1
think	1
answered	1
annushka	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
some	1
peaches	1
were	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
room	1
i	1
think	1
he	1
slipped	1
in	1
and	1
ate	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
sly	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
suddenly	1
roused	1
anna	1
from	1
the	1
helpless	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
partly	1
sincere	1
though	1
greatly	1
exaggerated	1
rôle	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
living	1
for	1
her	1
child	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
with	1
joy	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
plight	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
support	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
her	1
relation	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
or	1
to	1
vronsky	1
this	1
support	1
was	1
her	1
son	1
in	1
whatever	1
position	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
placed	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
lose	1
her	1
son	1
her	1
husband	1
might	1
put	1
her	1
to	1
shame	1
and	1
turn	1
her	1
out	1
vronsky	1
might	1
grow	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
apart	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
again	1
with	1
bitterness	1
and	1
reproach	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
son	1
she	1
had	1
an	1
aim	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
she	1
must	1
act	1
act	1
to	1
secure	1
this	1
relation	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
her	1
quickly	1
indeed	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
she	1
must	1
take	1
action	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
her	1
she	1
must	1
take	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
here	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
now	1
she	1
needed	1
consolation	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
insufferable	1
position	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
immediate	1
action	1
binding	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
of	1
going	1
away	1
somewhere	1
with	1
him	1
gave	1
her	1
this	1
consolation	1
she	1
dressed	1
quickly	1
went	1
downstairs	1
and	1
with	1
resolute	1
steps	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
she	1
found	1
as	1
usual	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
coffee	1
seryozha	1
and	1
his	1
governess	1

and	1

standing	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
under	1
a	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
intense	1
concentration	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
well	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
resembled	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
flowers	1
he	1
carried	1
the	1
governess	1
had	1
a	1
particularly	1
severe	1
expression	1
seryozha	1
screamed	1
shrilly	1
as	1
he	1
often	1
did	1
ah	1
mamma	1
and	1
stopped	1
hesitating	1
whether	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
greet	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
flowers	1
or	1
to	1
finish	1
making	1
the	1
wreath	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
flowers	1
the	1
governess	1
after	1
saying	1
good	1
morning	1
began	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
detailed	1
account	1
of	1

naughtiness	1
but	1
anna	1
did	1

very	1
wrong	1
said	1
anna	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
son	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
not	1
severely	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
that	1
bewildered	1
and	1
delighted	1
the	1
boy	1
and	1
she	1
kissed	1
him	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
astonished	1
governess	1
and	1
not	1

of	1
her	1
son	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1

in	1
store	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
peaches	1
seryozha	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
governess	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
was	1
wrong	1

deeply	1
into	1
his	1
scared	1
and	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
delighted	1

were	1
already	1
flowing	1
down	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
to	1
hide	1
them	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
abruptly	1
and	1
almost	1
ran	1
out	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
terrace	1
after	1
the	1
thunder	1
showers	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
cold	1
bright	1
weather	1
had	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
cold	1
in	1
the	1
bright	1
sun	1
that	1
filtered	1
through	1
the	1
freshly	1
washed	1
leaves	1
she	1
shivered	1
both	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
inward	1
horror	1
which	1
had	1
clutched	1
her	1
with	1
fresh	1
force	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
run	1
along	1

along	1
to	1

she	1
said	1
to	1
seryozha	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
her	1
out	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
straw	1
matting	1
of	1
the	1
terrace	1
can	1
it	1

that	1

won	1
t	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
couldn	1
t	1
be	1

she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
standing	1
still	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
aspen	1
trees	1
waving	1
in	1
the	1
wind	1
with	1
their	1
freshly	1
washed	1
brightly	1
shining	1
leaves	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
sunshine	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
forgive	1
her	1
that	1
everyone	1
and	1
everything	1
would	1
be	1
merciless	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
was	1
that	1
sky	1
that	1
green	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
split	1
in	1
two	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
i	1
mustn	1
t	1
mustn	1
t	1
think	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
i	1
must	1
get	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
where	1
when	1
whom	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
me	1
yes	1
to	1
moscow	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
train	1
annushka	1
and	1
seryozha	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
most	1
necessary	1
things	1
but	1
first	1
i	1
must	1
write	1
to	1
them	1
both	1
she	1
went	1
quickly	1
indoors	1
into	1
her	1
boudoir	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
wrote	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
after	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
i	1
cannot	1
remain	1
any	1
longer	1
in	1
your	1
house	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
and	1
taking	1
my	1
son	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
with	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
parents	1
the	1
son	1
should	1
remain	1
but	1
i	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
me	1
because	1
i	1
cannot	1
live	1
without	1
him	1
be	1
generous	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
up	1
to	1
this	1
point	1
she	1
wrote	1
rapidly	1
and	1
naturally	1
but	1
the	1
appeal	1
to	1
his	1
generosity	1
a	1
quality	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
winding	1
up	1
the	1
letter	1
with	1
something	1
touching	1
pulled	1
her	1
up	1
of	1
my	1
fault	1
and	1
my	1
remorse	1
i	1
cannot	1
speak	1
because	1
she	1
stopped	1
again	1
finding	1
no	1
connection	1
in	1
her	1
ideas	1
no	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
anything	1
and	1
tearing	1
up	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
wrote	1
it	1
again	1
leaving	1
out	1
the	1
allusion	1
to	1
generosity	1
and	1
sealed	1
it	1
up	1
another	1
letter	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
to	1
vronsky	1
i	1
have	1
told	1
my	1
husband	1
she	1
wrote	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
unable	1
to	1
write	1
more	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
coarse	1
so	1
unfeminine	1
and	1
what	1
more	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
again	1
a	1
flush	1
of	1
shame	1
spread	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
recalled	1
his	1
composure	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
anger	1
against	1
him	1
impelled	1
her	1
to	1
tear	1
the	1
sheet	1
with	1
the	1
phrase	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
into	1
tiny	1
bits	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
anything	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
closing	1
her	1
blotting	1
case	1
she	1
went	1
upstairs	1
told	1
the	1
governess	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
that	1
day	1
to	1

it	1
all	1
through	1

once	1
more	1
read	1
the	1

all	1
through	1
again	1
from	1
the	1

when	1
she	1

that	1
she	1
was	1
cold	1

over	1

that	1
a	1

calamity	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1

burst	1
upon	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1

had	1
regretted	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1

wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
those	1
words	1
could	1
be	1
unspoken	1
and	1
here	1
this	1
letter	1
regarded	1
them	1
as	1
unspoken	1

gave	1
her	1
what	1

wanted	1

now	1
this	1

to	1
her	1
more	1
awful	1

she	1
cried	1
jumping	1
up	1
and	1
keeping	1
back	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
to	1
write	1
him	1
another	1
letter	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
anything	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
position	1
however	1
false	1
and	1
dishonorable	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
writing	1
she	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
laying	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
them	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
with	1
sobs	1
and	1
heaving	1
breast	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
crying	1
she	1
was	1
weeping	1
that	1
her	1
dream	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
being	1
made	1
clear	1
and	1
definite	1
had	1
been	1
annihilated	1
forever	1
she	1
knew	1
beforehand	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
and	1
far	1
worse	1
indeed	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
she	1
enjoyed	1
and	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
consequence	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
that	1
this	1
position	1
was	1
precious	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
exchange	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
shameful	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
has	1
abandoned	1
husband	1
and	1
child	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
lover	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
she	1
might	1
struggle	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
herself	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
know	1
freedom	1
in	1
love	1
but	1
would	1
remain	1
forever	1
a	1
guilty	1
wife	1
with	1
the	1
menace	1
of	1
detection	1
hanging	1
over	1
her	1
at	1
every	1
instant	1
deceiving	1
her	1
husband	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
a	1
shameful	1
connection	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
living	1
apart	1
and	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
whose	1
life	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
share	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
awful	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
conceive	1
what	1
it	1
would	1
end	1
in	1
and	1
she	1
cried	1
without	1
restraint	1
as	1
children	1
cry	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
punished	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
footman	1

forced	1
her	1
to	1
rouse	1
herself	1
and	1

in	1
two	1
she	1
was	1
terrified	1
again	1
at	1
this	1
feeling	1
and	1
clutched	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
pretext	1
for	1
doing	1
something	1

might	1

her	1
thoughts	1

to	1

of	1
two	1
ladies	1

these	1
ladies	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
circle	1
which	1
though	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
was	1
utterly	1
hostile	1
to	1

of	1

the	1

in	1
princess	1

note	1
referred	1
to	1
her	1
refusal	1

now	1

was	1
eager	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
vronsky	1
anna	1
arrived	1
at	1
princess	1
tverskaya	1
s	1
earlier	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
guests	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
vronsky	1
s	1
footman	1
with	1
side	1
whiskers	1
combed	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
kammerjunker	1
went	1
in	1
too	1
he	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
let	1
her	1
pass	1
anna	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
recalled	1
that	1
vronsky	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
most	1
likely	1
he	1
was	1
sending	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
say	1
so	1
as	1
she	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
outer	1
garment	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
footman	1
pronouncing	1
his	1
r	1
s	1
even	1
like	1
a	1
kammerjunker	1
say	1
from	1
the	1
count	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
hand	1
the	1
note	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
question	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
turn	1
back	1
and	1
send	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
or	1
to	1
go	1
herself	1
to	1
see	1
him	1

neither	1
the	1
first	1
nor	1
the	1
second	1
nor	1
the	1
third	1
course	1
was	1
possible	1
already	1
she	1
heard	1
bells	1
ringing	1
to	1
announce	1
her	1
arrival	1
ahead	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
princess	1
tverskaya	1
s	1
footman	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms	1

in	1
the	1

to	1
walk	1

announced	1
another	1
footman	1
in	1
another	1
room	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
uncertainty	1
of	1
indecision	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
at	1
home	1
worse	1
in	1
fact	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
step	1
impossible	1
to	1
see	1
vronsky	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
remain	1
here	1
among	1
outsiders	1
in	1
company	1
so	1
uncongenial	1
to	1
her	1
present	1
mood	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
dress	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
suited	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
not	1

around	1

that	1
luxurious	1
setting	1
of	1
idleness	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
less	1
wretched	1
than	1
at	1
home	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
forced	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
of	1
itself	1
on	1
meeting	1
betsy	1
coming	1
towards	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
gown	1
that	1
struck	1
her	1
by	1
its	1
elegance	1
anna	1
smiled	1
at	1
her	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
princess	1
tverskaya	1
was	1
walking	1
with	1
tushkevitch	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
a	1
relation	1
who	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
joy	1
of	1
her	1
parents	1
in	1
the	1
provinces	1
was	1
spending	1
the	1
summer	1
with	1
the	1
fashionable	1
princess	1
there	1
was	1
probably	1
something	1
unusual	1
about	1
anna	1
for	1
betsy	1
noticed	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
slept	1
badly	1
answered	1
anna	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
supposed	1
brought	1
vronsky	1
s	1
note	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
said	1
betsy	1
i	1
m	1
tired	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
longing	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
tea	1
before	1
they	1
come	1
you	1
might	1
go	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
tushkevitch	1
with	1
masha	1
and	1
try	1
the	1
croquet	1
ground	1
over	1
there	1
where	1
they	1
ve	1
been	1
cutting	1
it	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
talk	1
a	1
little	1
over	1
tea	1
we	1
ll	1
have	1
a	1
cozy	1
chat	1
eh	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
english	1
to	1
anna	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
pressing	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
held	1
a	1
parasol	1
yes	1
especially	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
stay	1
very	1
long	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
m	1
forced	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
old	1
madame	1
vrede	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
promising	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
century	1
said	1
anna	1
to	1
whom	1
lying	1
alien	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
nature	1
had	1
become	1
not	1
merely	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
in	1
society	1
but	1
a	1
positive	1
source	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
why	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
explained	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
simply	1
from	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
as	1
vronsky	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
here	1
she	1
had	1
better	1
secure	1
her	1
own	1
freedom	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
somehow	1
but	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
old	1
madame	1
vrede	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
many	1
other	1
people	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
explained	1
and	1
yet	1
as	1
it	1
afterwards	1
turned	1
out	1
had	1
she	1
contrived	1
the	1
most	1
cunning	1
devices	1
to	1
meet	1
vronsky	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
better	1
no	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
go	1
for	1
anything	1
answered	1
betsy	1
looking	1
intently	1
into	1
anna	1
s	1
face	1
really	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
not	1
fond	1
of	1
you	1
i	1
should	1
feel	1
offended	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
afraid	1
my	1
society	1
would	1
compromise	1
you	1
tea	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
dining	1
room	1
please	1
she	1
said	1
half	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
addressing	1
the	1
footman	1
taking	1
the	1
note	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
read	1
it	1
alexey	1
s	1
playing	1
us	1
false	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
french	1
he	1
writes	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
come	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
as	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
enter	1
her	1
head	1
that	1
vronsky	1
could	1
mean	1
anything	1
more	1
to	1
anna	1
than	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
croquet	1
anna	1
knew	1
that	1
betsy	1
knew	1
everything	1
but	1
hearing	1
how	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
vronsky	1
before	1
her	1
she	1
almost	1
felt	1
persuaded	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
nothing	1
ah	1
said	1
anna	1
indifferently	1
as	1
though	1
not	1
greatly	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
smiling	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
or	1
your	1
friends	1
compromise	1
anyone	1
this	1
playing	1
with	1
words	1
this	1
hiding	1
of	1
a	1
secret	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
fascination	1
for	1
anna	1
as	1
indeed	1
it	1
has	1
for	1
all	1
women	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
concealment	1
not	1
the	1
aim	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
concealment	1
was	1
contrived	1
but	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
concealment	1
itself	1
which	1
attracted	1
her	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
more	1
catholic	1
than	1
the	1
pope	1

said	1

why	1

not	1
finding	1
you	1

you	1

a	1
real	1

of	1
mad	1

out	1

anna	1
after	1
being	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
showed	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
asking	1
an	1
idle	1
question	1
but	1
that	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
asking	1
was	1
of	1
more	1
importance	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
it	1
should	1

relations	1
with	1

smiled	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
anna	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
new	1
manner	1
she	1
said	1
they	1
ve	1
all	1
adopted	1
that	1
manner	1
they	1
ve	1
flung	1
their	1
caps	1
over	1
the	1
windmills	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
ways	1
and	1
ways	1
of	1
flinging	1
them	1
yes	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
her	1
relations	1
precisely	1
with	1
kaluzhsky	1
betsy	1
broke	1
into	1
unexpectedly	1
mirthful	1
and	1
irrepressible	1
laughter	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
rarely	1
happened	1
with	1
her	1
you	1
re	1
encroaching	1
on	1
princess	1

s	1
special	1
domain	1
now	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
an	1
enfant	1
terrible	1
and	1
betsy	1
obviously	1
tried	1
to	1
restrain	1
herself	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
peals	1
of	1
that	1
infectious	1
laughter	1
that	1
people	1
laugh	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
laugh	1
often	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
ask	1
them	1

brought	1
out	1
between	1
tears	1
of	1
laughter	1
no	1
you	1
laugh	1
said	1
anna	1
laughing	1
too	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself	1

i	1
never	1

answered	1
betsy	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
she	1
began	1
filling	1
the	1
little	1
transparent	1
cups	1
with	1
fragrant	1
tea	1
putting	1
a	1
cup	1
before	1
anna	1

took	1
out	1

lighted	1

quite	1
serious	1

up	1
her	1
cup	1
i	1
understand	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
understand	1
liza	1
liza	1
now	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
naïve	1
natures	1
that	1
like	1
children	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
s	1
good	1
and	1
what	1
s	1
bad	1
anyway	1
she	1
didn	1
t	1
comprehend	1
it	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
young	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
s	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
comprehension	1
suits	1
her	1
now	1
perhaps	1
she	1
doesn	1
t	1
know	1
on	1
purpose	1
said	1
betsy	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1

anyway	1
it	1
suits	1
her	1
the	1
very	1

you	1
see	1
may	1
be	1
looked	1
at	1
tragically	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
misery	1

it	1
may	1
be	1
looked	1
at	1
simply	1
and	1
even	1
humorously	1
possibly	1
you	1
are	1
inclined	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
things	1
too	1
tragically	1
how	1

and	1
followed	1
her	1
about	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
chained	1
to	1
her	1
keeping	1
his	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
eat	1
her	1
sappho	1
shtoltz	1
was	1
a	1
blonde	1
beauty	1
with	1
black	1
eyes	1
she	1
walked	1
with	1
smart	1
little	1
steps	1
in	1
high	1
heeled	1
shoes	1
and	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
vigorously	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
anna	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
this	1
new	1
star	1
of	1
fashion	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
the	1
exaggerated	1
extreme	1
to	1
which	1
her	1
dress	1
was	1
carried	1
and	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
her	1
manners	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
superstructure	1
of	1
soft	1
golden	1
hair	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
false	1
mixed	1
that	1
her	1
head	1
was	1
equal	1
in	1
size	1
to	1
the	1
elegantly	1
rounded	1
bust	1
of	1
which	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
exposed	1
in	1
front	1
the	1
impulsive	1
abruptness	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
legs	1
were	1
distinctly	1
marked	1
under	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
involuntarily	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
mind	1
where	1
in	1
the	1
undulating	1
piled	1
up	1
mountain	1
of	1
material	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
the	1
real	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
so	1
small	1
and	1
slender	1
so	1
naked	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
so	1
hidden	1
behind	1
and	1
below	1
really	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
betsy	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
introduce	1
her	1
to	1
anna	1
only	1
fancy	1
we	1
all	1
but	1
ran	1
over	1
two	1
soldiers	1
she	1
began	1
telling	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
using	1
her	1
eyes	1
smiling	1
and	1
twitching	1
away	1
her	1
tail	1
which	1
she	1
flung	1
back	1
at	1
one	1
stroke	1
all	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
i	1
drove	1
here	1
with	1
vaska	1
ah	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
mentioning	1
his	1
surname	1
she	1
introduced	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
reddening	1
a	1
little	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
ringing	1
laugh	1
at	1
her	1
mistake	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
her	1
having	1
called	1
him	1
vaska	1
to	1
a	1
stranger	1
vaska	1
bowed	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
anna	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
addressed	1
sappho	1

ve	1
lost	1
your	1
bet	1

got	1
here	1
first	1
pay	1
up	1
said	1
he	1
smiling	1
sappho	1
laughed	1
still	1
more	1
festively	1
not	1
just	1
now	1
said	1
she	1
oh	1
all	1
right	1
i	1
ll	1
have	1
it	1
later	1
very	1
well	1
very	1
well	1
oh	1

she	1
turned	1
suddenly	1
to	1
princess	1
betsy	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
nice	1
person	1
i	1
positively	1
forgot	1
it	1
i	1
ve	1
brought	1
you	1
a	1
visitor	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
comes	1
the	1
unexpected	1
young	1
visitor	1
whom	1
sappho	1
had	1
invited	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
was	1
however	1
a	1
personage	1
of	1
such	1
consequence	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
youth	1
both	1
the	1
ladies	1
rose	1
on	1
his	1
entrance	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
admirer	1
of	1
sappho	1
s	1
he	1
now	1
dogged	1
her	1
footsteps	1
like	1
vaska	1
soon	1
after	1
prince	1
kaluzhsky	1
arrived	1
and	1
liza	1
merkalova	1
with	1
stremov	1
liza	1
merkalova	1
was	1
a	1
thin	1
brunette	1
with	1
an	1
oriental	1
languid	1
type	1
of	1
face	1
and	1
as	1
everyone	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
exquisite	1
enigmatic	1
eyes	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
her	1
dark	1
dress	1
anna	1
immediately	1
observed	1
and	1
appreciated	1
the	1
fact	1
was	1
in	1
perfect	1
harmony	1
with	1
her	1
style	1
of	1
beauty	1
liza	1
was	1
as	1
soft	1
and	1
enervated	1
as	1
sappho	1
was	1
smart	1
and	1
abrupt	1
but	1
to	1
anna	1
s	1
taste	1
liza	1
was	1
far	1
more	1
attractive	1
betsy	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
anna	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
adopted	1
the	1
pose	1
of	1
an	1
innocent	1
child	1
but	1
when	1
anna	1
saw	1
her	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
truth	1
she	1
really	1
was	1
both	1
innocent	1
and	1
corrupt	1
but	1
a	1
sweet	1
and	1
passive	1
woman	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
her	1
tone	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
sappho	1
s	1
that	1
like	1
sappho	1
she	1
had	1
two	1
men	1
one	1
young	1
and	1
one	1
old	1
tacked	1
onto	1
her	1
and	1
devouring	1
her	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
higher	1
than	1
what	1
surrounded	1
her	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
diamond	1
among	1
glass	1
imitations	1
this	1
glow	1
shone	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
exquisite	1
truly	1
enigmatic	1
eyes	1
the	1
weary	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
passionate	1
glance	1
of	1
those	1
eyes	1
encircled	1
by	1
dark	1
rings	1
impressed	1
one	1
by	1
its	1
perfect	1
sincerity	1
everyone	1
looking	1
into	1
those	1
eyes	1
fancied	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
wholly	1
and	1
knowing	1
her	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
love	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
anna	1
her	1
whole	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
at	1

with	1
a	1

how	1
fond	1
countess	1
lidia	1

was	1
of	1

which	1
suggested	1

with	1
his	1
whole	1

to	1
please	1
her	1
and	1
show	1
his	1

for	1

so	1

what	1
was	1
in	1

for	1
her	1
was	1
so	1
difficult	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
whether	1
to	1
remain	1
whether	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
the	1
painful	1
moment	1
of	1
explanation	1

remembering	1
what	1
was	1
in	1

for	1
her	1
alone	1
at	1
home	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
some	1
decision	1
remembering	1
that	1
gesture	1
terrible	1
even	1
in	1

when	1
she	1
had	1
clutched	1

was	1

on	1
such	1
occasions	1
on	1
waking	1
up	1

seeing	1
his	1
comrade	1
at	1
the	1

quietly	1
dressed	1

went	1
out	1

every	1

to	1
the	1

details	1
all	1
the	1
complexity	1
of	1
the	1

surrounding	1

cannot	1

imagining	1
that	1
the	1
complexity	1
of	1
these	1
conditions	1
and	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
making	1
them	1
clear	1
is	1
something	1
exceptional	1
and	1
personal	1
peculiar	1
to	1
himself	1

never	1

that	1
others	1
are	1
surrounded	1
by	1
just	1
as	1
complicated	1
an	1
array	1
of	1
personal	1
affairs	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
indeed	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
vronsky	1
and	1
not	1
without	1
inward	1
pride	1
and	1
not	1
without	1
reason	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
would	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
difficulties	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
forced	1
to	1
some	1
dishonorable	1
course	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
difficult	1
position	1
but	1
vronsky	1
felt	1
that	1
now	1
especially	1
it	1
was	1
essential	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
and	1
define	1
his	1
position	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
avoid	1
getting	1
into	1
difficulties	1
what	1
vronsky	1
attacked	1
first	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
easiest	1
was	1
his	1
pecuniary	1
position	1
writing	1
out	1
on	1
note	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
minute	1
hand	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
owed	1
he	1
added	1
up	1
the	1
amount	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
debts	1
amounted	1
to	1
seventeen	1
thousand	1
and	1
some	1
odd	1
hundreds	1
which	1
he	1
left	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
clearness	1
reckoning	1
up	1
his	1
money	1
and	1
his	1
bank	1
book	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
one	1
thousand	1
eight	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
and	1
nothing	1
coming	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
new	1
year	1
reckoning	1
over	1
again	1
his	1
list	1
of	1
debts	1
vronsky	1
copied	1
it	1
dividing	1
it	1
into	1
three	1
classes	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
debts	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
at	1
once	1
or	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
have	1
the	1
money	1
ready	1
so	1
that	1
on	1
demand	1
for	1
payment	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
delay	1
in	1
paying	1
such	1
debts	1
amounted	1
to	1
about	1
four	1
thousand	1
one	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
for	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
two	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
as	1
surety	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
comrade	1
venovsky	1
who	1
had	1
lost	1
that	1
sum	1
to	1
a	1
cardsharper	1
in	1
vronsky	1
s	1
presence	1
vronsky	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
money	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
amount	1
then	1
but	1
venovsky	1
and	1
yashvin	1
had	1
insisted	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
pay	1
and	1
not	1
vronsky	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
played	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
well	1
but	1
vronsky	1
knew	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
dirty	1
business	1
though	1
his	1
only	1
share	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
undertaking	1
by	1
word	1
of	1
mouth	1
to	1
be	1
surety	1
for	1
venovsky	1
it	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
two	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
fling	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
swindler	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
words	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
this	1
first	1
and	1
most	1
important	1
division	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
four	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
the	1
second	1
class	1
eight	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
consisted	1
of	1
less	1
important	1
debts	1
these	1
were	1
principally	1
accounts	1
owing	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
his	1
race	1
horses	1
to	1
the	1
purveyor	1
of	1
oats	1
and	1
hay	1
the	1
english	1
saddler	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
some	1
two	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
on	1
these	1
debts	1
too	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
free	1
from	1
anxiety	1
the	1
last	1
class	1
of	1
debts	1
to	1
shops	1
to	1
hotels	1
to	1
his	1
tailor	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
considered	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
needed	1
at	1
least	1
six	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
for	1
current	1
expenses	1
and	1
he	1
only	1
had	1
one	1
thousand	1
eight	1
hundred	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
one	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
of	1
revenue	1
which	1
was	1
what	1
everyone	1
fixed	1
as	1
vronsky	1
s	1
income	1
such	1
debts	1
one	1
would	1
suppose	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
embarrassing	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
one	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
immense	1
property	1
which	1
alone	1
yielded	1
a	1
yearly	1
income	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
was	1
left	1
undivided	1
between	1
the	1
brothers	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
elder	1
brother	1
with	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
debts	1
married	1
princess	1
varya	1
tchirkova	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
decembrist	1
without	1
any	1
fortune	1
whatever	1
alexey	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
elder	1
brother	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
income	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
estate	1
reserving	1
for	1
himself	1
only	1
twenty	1
five	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
from	1
it	1
alexey	1
had	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
that	1
sum	1
would	1
be	1
sufficient	1
for	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
married	1
which	1
he	1
probably	1
never	1
would	1
do	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
expensive	1
regiments	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
married	1
could	1
not	1
decline	1
the	1
gift	1
his	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
her	1
own	1
separate	1
property	1
had	1
allowed	1
alexey	1
every	1
year	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
twenty	1
five	1
thousand	1
he	1
had	1
reserved	1
and	1
alexey	1
had	1
spent	1
it	1
all	1
of	1
late	1
his	1
mother	1
incensed	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
affair	1
and	1
his	1
leaving	1
moscow	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
sending	1
him	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
vronsky	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
living	1
on	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
forty	1
five	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
having	1
only	1
received	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
that	1
year	1
found	1
himself	1
now	1
in	1
difficulties	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
difficulties	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
apply	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
for	1
money	1
her	1
last	1
letter	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
had	1
particularly	1
exasperated	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hints	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
succeed	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
lead	1
a	1
life	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
scandal	1
to	1
all	1
good	1
society	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
attempt	1
to	1
buy	1
him	1
stung	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
colder	1
than	1
ever	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
draw	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
generous	1
word	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
once	1
uttered	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
vaguely	1
foreseeing	1
certain	1
eventualities	1
in	1
his	1
intrigue	1
with	1
madame	1
karenina	1
that	1
this	1
generous	1
word	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
thoughtlessly	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
married	1
he	1
might	1
need	1
all	1
the	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
of	1
income	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
draw	1
back	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
recall	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wife	1
to	1
remember	1
how	1
that	1
sweet	1
delightful	1
varya	1
sought	1
at	1
every	1
convenient	1
opportunity	1
to	1
remind	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
remembered	1
his	1
generosity	1
and	1
appreciated	1
it	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
taking	1
back	1
his	1
gift	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
impossible	1
as	1
beating	1
a	1
woman	1
stealing	1
or	1
lying	1
one	1
thing	1
only	1
could	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
vronsky	1
determined	1
upon	1
it	1
without	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
hesitation	1
to	1
borrow	1
money	1
from	1
a	1
money	1
lender	1
ten	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
a	1
proceeding	1
which	1
presented	1
no	1
difficulty	1
to	1
cut	1
down	1
his	1
expenses	1
generally	1
and	1
to	1
sell	1
his	1
race	1
horses	1
resolving	1
on	1
this	1
he	1
promptly	1
wrote	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
rolandak	1
who	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
sent	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
offers	1
to	1
buy	1
horses	1
from	1
him	1
then	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
englishman	1
and	1
the	1
money	1
lender	1
and	1
divided	1
what	1
money	1
he	1
had	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
accounts	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
pay	1
having	1
finished	1
this	1
business	1
he	1
wrote	1
a	1
cold	1
and	1
cutting	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
notebook	1
three	1
notes	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
read	1
them	1
again	1
burned	1
them	1
and	1
remembering	1
their	1
conversation	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
he	1
sank	1
into	1
meditation	1
chapter	1
20	1
vronsky	1
s	1
life	1
was	1
particularly	1
happy	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
which	1
defined	1
with	1
unfailing	1
certitude	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
covered	1
only	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
circle	1
of	1
contingencies	1
but	1
then	1
the	1
principles	1
were	1
never	1
doubtful	1
and	1
vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
never	1
went	1
outside	1
that	1
circle	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
hesitation	1
about	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
principles	1
laid	1
down	1
as	1
invariable	1
rules	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
pay	1
a	1
cardsharper	1
but	1
need	1
not	1
pay	1
a	1
tailor	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
never	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
one	1
may	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
never	1
cheat	1
anyone	1
but	1
one	1
may	1
a	1
husband	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
never	1
pardon	1
an	1
insult	1
but	1
one	1
may	1
give	1
one	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
these	1
principles	1
were	1
possibly	1
not	1
reasonable	1
and	1
not	1
good	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
unfailing	1
certainty	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
adhered	1
to	1
them	1
vronsky	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
hold	1
his	1
head	1
up	1
only	1
quite	1
lately	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
anna	1
vronsky	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
his	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
did	1
not	1
fully	1
cover	1
all	1
possible	1
contingencies	1
and	1
to	1
foresee	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
difficulties	1
and	1
perplexities	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
guiding	1
clue	1
his	1
present	1
relation	1
to	1
anna	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
it	1
was	1
clearly	1
and	1
precisely	1
defined	1
in	1
the	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
guided	1
she	1
was	1
an	1
honorable	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
bestowed	1
her	1
love	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
therefore	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
or	1
even	1
more	1
respect	1
than	1
a	1
lawful	1
wife	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
his	1
hand	1
chopped	1
off	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
allowed	1
himself	1
by	1
a	1
word	1
by	1
a	1
hint	1
to	1
humiliate	1
her	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
fall	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
fullest	1
respect	1
a	1
woman	1
could	1
look	1
for	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
society	1
too	1
was	1
clear	1
everyone	1
might	1
know	1
might	1
suspect	1
it	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
might	1
dare	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
if	1
any	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
force	1
all	1
who	1
might	1
speak	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
and	1
to	1
respect	1
the	1
non	1
existent	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
the	1
husband	1
was	1
the	1
clearest	1
of	1
all	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
anna	1
loved	1
vronsky	1
he	1
had	1
regarded	1
his	1
own	1
right	1
over	1
her	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
unassailable	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
simply	1
a	1
superfluous	1
and	1
tiresome	1
person	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
pitiable	1
position	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
that	1
be	1
helped	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
the	1
husband	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
was	1
to	1
demand	1
satisfaction	1
with	1
a	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
vronsky	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
this	1
at	1
any	1
minute	1
but	1
of	1
late	1
new	1
inner	1
relations	1
had	1
arisen	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
which	1
frightened	1
vronsky	1
by	1
their	1
indefiniteness	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
child	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
fact	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
called	1
for	1
something	1
not	1
fully	1
defined	1
in	1
that	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hitherto	1
steered	1
his	1
course	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
indeed	1
caught	1
unawares	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
when	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
his	1
heart	1
had	1
prompted	1
him	1
to	1
beg	1
her	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
husband	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
but	1
now	1
thinking	1
things	1
over	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
manage	1
to	1
avoid	1
that	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
wrong	1
if	1
i	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
must	1
mean	1
uniting	1
her	1
life	1
with	1
mine	1
am	1
i	1
prepared	1
for	1
that	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
take	1
her	1
away	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
money	1
supposing	1
i	1
could	1
arrange	1
but	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
take	1
her	1
away	1
while	1
i	1
m	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
if	1
i	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
that	1
is	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
thoughtful	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
service	1
or	1
not	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
chief	1
though	1
hidden	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
of	1
which	1
none	1
knew	1
but	1
he	1
ambition	1
was	1
the	1
old	1
dream	1
of	1
his	1
youth	1
and	1
childhood	1
a	1
dream	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
confess	1
even	1
to	1
himself	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
now	1
this	1
passion	1
was	1
even	1
doing	1
battle	1
with	1
his	1
love	1
his	1
first	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
had	1
been	1
successful	1
but	1
two	1
years	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
mistake	1
anxious	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
independence	1
and	1
to	1
advance	1
he	1
had	1
refused	1
a	1
post	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
offered	1
him	1
hoping	1
that	1
this	1
refusal	1
would	1
heighten	1
his	1
value	1
but	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
bold	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
passed	1
over	1
and	1
having	1
whether	1
he	1
liked	1
or	1
not	1
taken	1
up	1
for	1
himself	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
an	1
independent	1
man	1
he	1
carried	1
it	1
off	1
with	1
great	1
tact	1
and	1
good	1
sense	1
behaving	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
bore	1
no	1
grudge	1
against	1
anyone	1
did	1
not	1
regard	1
himself	1
as	1
injured	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
and	1
cared	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
enjoying	1
himself	1
in	1
reality	1
he	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
enjoy	1
himself	1
as	1
long	1
ago	1
as	1
the	1
year	1
before	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
moscow	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
independent	1
attitude	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
might	1
have	1
done	1
anything	1
but	1
cared	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
was	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
pall	1
that	1
many	1
people	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
fancy	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
capable	1
of	1
anything	1
but	1
being	1
a	1
straightforward	1
good	1
natured	1
fellow	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
madame	1
karenina	1
by	1
creating	1
so	1
much	1
sensation	1
and	1
attracting	1
general	1
attention	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
fresh	1
distinction	1
which	1
soothed	1
his	1
gnawing	1
worm	1
of	1
ambition	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
but	1
a	1
week	1
before	1
that	1
worm	1
had	1
been	1
roused	1
up	1
again	1
with	1
fresh	1
force	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
childhood	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
set	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
coterie	1
his	1
comrade	1
in	1
the	1
corps	1

had	1
left	1
school	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
rival	1
in	1
class	1
in	1
gymnastics	1
in	1
their	1
scrapes	1
and	1
their	1
dreams	1
of	1
glory	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
from	1
central	1
asia	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
two	1
steps	1
up	1
in	1
rank	1
and	1
an	1
order	1
rarely	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
generals	1
so	1
young	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
arrived	1
in	1
petersburg	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
newly	1

a	1
schoolfellow	1
of	1

and	1
of	1
the	1

age	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
and	1
was	1
expecting	1
a	1
command	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
political	1
events	1

independent	1

never	1

up	1

walked	1
about	1

met	1
vronsky	1

eyes	1
were	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
singers	1
in	1
white	1
linen	1

standing	1
near	1
a	1
barrel	1
of	1
vodka	1
and	1
the	1
robust	1
good	1
humored	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
colonel	1
surrounded	1
by	1
officers	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
of	1
the	1
balcony	1
and	1
was	1
loudly	1
shouting	1
across	1
the	1
band	1
that	1
played	1
offenbach	1
s	1
quadrille	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
giving	1
some	1
orders	1
to	1
a	1
few	1
soldiers	1
standing	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
soldiers	1
a	1
quartermaster	1
and	1
several	1
subalterns	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
balcony	1
with	1
vronsky	1
the	1
colonel	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
with	1
a	1
tumbler	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
proposed	1
the	1
toast	1

said	1
to	1
the	1
rosy	1
checked	1
smart	1
looking	1
quartermaster	1
standing	1
just	1
before	1
him	1
still	1
youngish	1
looking	1
though	1
doing	1
his	1
second	1
term	1
of	1
service	1
it	1
was	1
three	1
years	1
since	1
vronsky	1
had	1
seen	1
serpuhovskoy	1
he	1
looked	1
more	1
robust	1
had	1
let	1
his	1
whiskers	1
grow	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
graceful	1
creature	1
whose	1
face	1
and	1
figure	1
were	1
even	1
more	1
striking	1
from	1
their	1
softness	1
and	1
nobility	1
than	1
their	1
beauty	1
the	1
only	1
change	1
vronsky	1
detected	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
subdued	1
continual	1
radiance	1
of	1
beaming	1
content	1
which	1
settles	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
successful	1
and	1
are	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
their	1
success	1
by	1
everyone	1
vronsky	1
knew	1
that	1
radiant	1
air	1
and	1
immediately	1
observed	1
it	1
in	1
serpuhovskoy	1
as	1
serpuhovskoy	1
came	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
he	1
saw	1
vronsky	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
lighted	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
tossed	1
his	1
head	1
upwards	1
and	1
waved	1
the	1
glass	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
greeting	1
vronsky	1
and	1
showing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
gesture	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
who	1
stood	1
craning	1
forward	1
his	1
lips	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
kissed	1
here	1

the	1
moist	1
fresh	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
gallant	1
looking	1
quartermaster	1
and	1
wiping	1
his	1
mouth	1
with	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
vronsky	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
he	1
said	1
squeezing	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
drawing	1
him	1
on	1
one	1
side	1

look	1
after	1
him	1
the	1
colonel	1
shouted	1
to	1
yashvin	1
pointing	1
to	1
vronsky	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
below	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
why	1

added	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
adjutant	1

this	1
divided	1
from	1
me	1
each	1
man	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
runs	1
to	1
and	1
he	1
hurriedly	1
took	1
notes	1
for	1
three	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
from	1
his	1
pocketbook	1
blushing	1
a	1
little	1
vronsky	1

a	1
long	1
while	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
drinking	1
they	1
tossed	1
serpuhovskoy	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
caught	1
him	1
again	1
several	1
times	1
then	1
they	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
the	1
colonel	1
himself	1
danced	1
with	1
petritsky	1
then	1
the	1
colonel	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
show	1
signs	1
of	1
feebleness	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
and	1
began	1
demonstrating	1
to	1
yashvin	1
the	1
superiority	1
of	1
russia	1
over	1
prussia	1
especially	1
in	1
cavalry	1
attack	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lull	1
in	1
the	1
revelry	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
serpuhovskoy	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
bathroom	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
found	1
vronsky	1
there	1
vronsky	1
was	1
drenching	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
water	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
sunburnt	1
hairy	1
neck	1
under	1
the	1
tap	1
and	1
was	1
rubbing	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
vronsky	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
serpuhovskoy	1
they	1
both	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
bathroom	1
on	1
a	1
lounge	1
and	1
a	1
conversation	1
began	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
interesting	1
to	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
ve	1
always	1
been	1
hearing	1
about	1
you	1
through	1
my	1
wife	1
said	1
serpuhovskoy	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
seeing	1
her	1
pretty	1
often	1
she	1
s	1
friendly	1
with	1
varya	1
and	1
they	1
re	1
the	1
only	1
women	1
in	1
petersburg	1
i	1
care	1
about	1
seeing	1
answered	1
vronsky	1
smiling	1
he	1
smiled	1
because	1
he	1
foresaw	1
the	1
topic	1
the	1
conversation	1
would	1
turn	1
on	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
only	1
ones	1
serpuhovskoy	1
queried	1
smiling	1
yes	1
and	1
i	1
heard	1
news	1
of	1
you	1
but	1
not	1
only	1
through	1
your	1
wife	1
said	1
vronsky	1
checking	1
his	1
hint	1
by	1
a	1
stern	1
expression	1
of	1
face	1
i	1
was	1
greatly	1
delighted	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
success	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
surprised	1
i	1
expected	1
even	1
more	1
serpuhovskoy	1
smiled	1
such	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
obviously	1
agreeable	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
conceal	1
it	1
well	1
i	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
expected	1
less	1
i	1
ll	1
own	1
frankly	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
very	1
glad	1
i	1
m	1
ambitious	1
that	1
s	1
my	1
weakness	1
and	1
i	1
confess	1
to	1
it	1
perhaps	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
confess	1
to	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
hadn	1
t	1
been	1
successful	1
said	1
vronsky	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
suppose	1
so	1
said	1
serpuhovskoy	1
smiling	1
again	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
say	1
life	1
wouldn	1
t	1
be	1
worth	1
living	1
without	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
dull	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
mistaken	1
but	1
i	1
fancy	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
certain	1
capacity	1
for	1
the	1
line	1
i	1
ve	1
chosen	1
and	1
that	1
power	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
people	1
i	1
know	1
said	1
serpuhovskoy	1
with	1
beaming	1
consciousness	1
of	1
success	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
nearer	1
i	1
get	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
better	1
pleased	1
i	1
am	1
perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
true	1
for	1
you	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
everyone	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
so	1
too	1
but	1
here	1
i	1
live	1
and	1
think	1
life	1
worth	1
living	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
there	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
here	1
it	1
comes	1
said	1
serpuhovskoy	1
laughing	1
ever	1
since	1
i	1
heard	1
about	1
you	1
about	1
your	1
refusal	1
i	1
began	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
approved	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
did	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
ways	1
of	1
doing	1
everything	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
your	1
action	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
do	1
it	1
quite	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
what	1
s	1
done	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
undone	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
never	1
go	1
back	1
on	1
what	1
i	1
ve	1
done	1
and	1
besides	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
well	1
off	1
very	1
well	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
but	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
that	1
i	1
wouldn	1
t	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
your	1
brother	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
nice	1
child	1
like	1
our	1
host	1
here	1
there	1
he	1
goes	1
he	1
added	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
hurrah	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
happy	1
but	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
satisfy	1
you	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
say	1
it	1
did	1
satisfy	1
me	1
yes	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
wanted	1
by	1

with	1

at	1

an	1
absurdity	1
tout	1

it	1
s	1
an	1
old	1
trick	1
no	1
what	1

wanted	1
is	1
a	1
powerful	1
party	1
of	1
independent	1
men	1
like	1
you	1
and	1
me	1
but	1
why	1
so	1
vronsky	1
mentioned	1
a	1
few	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
power	1
why	1
aren	1
t	1
they	1
independent	1
men	1
simply	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
or	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
from	1

an	1
independent	1
fortune	1
they	1

we	1
have	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
bought	1
either	1
by	1
money	1
or	1
by	1
favor	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
support	1
for	1
themselves	1
in	1
inventing	1
a	1
policy	1
and	1
they	1
bring	1
forward	1
some	1
notion	1
some	1
policy	1
that	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
that	1
does	1
harm	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
policy	1
is	1
really	1
only	1
a	1

when	1
you	1
get	1
a	1
peep	1
at	1
their	1
cards	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
inferior	1
to	1
them	1
stupider	1
perhaps	1
though	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
why	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
inferior	1
to	1
them	1

you	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
one	1
important	1
advantage	1
over	1
them	1
for	1
certain	1
in	1
being	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
buy	1
and	1
such	1
men	1
are	1
more	1
needed	1
than	1
ever	1
vronsky	1
listened	1
attentively	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
interested	1
by	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
serpuhovskoy	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
contemplating	1
a	1
struggle	1
with	1
the	1
existing	1
powers	1
and	1
already	1
had	1
his	1
likes	1
and	1
dislikes	1
in	1
that	1
higher	1
world	1
while	1
his	1
own	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
governing	1
world	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
beyond	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
vronsky	1
felt	1
too	1
how	1
powerful	1
serpuhovskoy	1
might	1
become	1
through	1
his	1
unmistakable	1
faculty	1
for	1
thinking	1
things	1
out	1
and	1
for	1
taking	1
things	1
in	1
through	1
his	1
intelligence	1
and	1
gift	1
of	1
words	1
so	1
rarely	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
moved	1
and	1
ashamed	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
felt	1
envious	1
still	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
of	1
most	1
importance	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
answered	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
the	1
desire	1
for	1
power	1
i	1
had	1
it	1
once	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
gone	1
excuse	1
me	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
true	1
said	1
serpuhovskoy	1
smiling	1
yes	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
now	1
vronsky	1
added	1
to	1
be	1
truthful	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
now	1
that	1
s	1
another	1
thing	1
but	1
that	1
now	1
won	1
t	1
last	1
forever	1
perhaps	1
answered	1
vronsky	1
you	1
say	1
perhaps	1
serpuhovskoy	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
though	1
guessing	1
his	1
thoughts	1
but	1
i	1
say	1
for	1
certain	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
action	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
it	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
but	1
you	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
up	1
i	1
only	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
carte	1
blanche	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
protection	1
though	1
indeed	1
why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
i	1
protect	1
you	1
you	1
ve	1
protected	1
me	1
often	1
enough	1
i	1
should	1
hope	1
our	1
friendship	1
rises	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
tenderly	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
give	1
me	1
carte	1
blanche	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
i	1
ll	1
draw	1
you	1
upwards	1
imperceptibly	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
i	1
want	1
nothing	1
said	1
vronsky	1
except	1
that	1
all	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
serpuhovskoy	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
stood	1
facing	1
him	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
all	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
understand	1
what	1
that	1
means	1
but	1
listen	1
we	1
re	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
you	1
ve	1
known	1
a	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
women	1
perhaps	1
than	1
i	1
have	1
serpohovskoy	1
s	1
smile	1
and	1
gestures	1
told	1
vronsky	1
that	1
he	1
mustn	1
t	1
be	1
afraid	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
tender	1
and	1
careful	1
in	1
touching	1
the	1
sore	1
place	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
married	1
and	1
believe	1
me	1
in	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
thoroughly	1
one	1
s	1
wife	1
if	1
one	1
loves	1
her	1
as	1
someone	1
has	1
said	1
one	1
gets	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
women	1
better	1
than	1
if	1
one	1
knew	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
we	1
re	1
coming	1
directly	1
vronsky	1
shouted	1
to	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
vronsky	1
was	1
longing	1
now	1
to	1
hear	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
know	1
what	1
serpuhovskey	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
here	1
s	1
my	1
opinion	1
for	1
you	1
women	1
are	1
the	1
chief	1
stumbling	1
block	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
career	1
it	1
s	1
hard	1
to	1
love	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
do	1
anything	1
there	1
s	1
only	1
one	1
way	1
of	1
having	1
love	1
conveniently	1
without	1
its	1
being	1
a	1
hindrance	1

just	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
only	1
carry	1
a	1
fardeau	1
and	1
do	1
something	1
with	1
your	1
hands	1
when	1
the	1
fardeau	1
is	1
tied	1
on	1
your	1
back	1

that	1

what	1
i	1
felt	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
married	1
my	1
hands	1
were	1
suddenly	1
set	1
free	1
but	1
to	1
drag	1
that	1
fardeau	1
about	1
with	1
you	1
without	1
marriage	1
your	1
hands	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
so	1
full	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1

at	1
mazankov	1
at	1
krupov	1
they	1
ve	1
ruined	1
their	1
careers	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
women	1
what	1
women	1
said	1
vronsky	1
recalling	1
the	1
frenchwoman	1
and	1
the	1
actress	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
mentioned	1
were	1
connected	1
the	1
firmer	1
the	1
woman	1
s	1
footing	1
in	1
society	1
the	1
worse	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
s	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
not	1
merely	1
carrying	1
the	1
fardeau	1
in	1
your	1
arms	1
but	1
tearing	1
it	1
away	1
from	1
someone	1
else	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
loved	1
vronsky	1
said	1
softly	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
anna	1
perhaps	1
but	1
you	1
remember	1
what	1
i	1
ve	1
said	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
another	1
thing	1
women	1
are	1
all	1
more	1
materialistic	1
than	1

in	1
petersburg	1
chapter	1
22	1
it	1
was	1
six	1
o	1
clock	1
already	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
quickly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
not	1
to	1
drive	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
horses	1
known	1
to	1
everyone	1
vronsky	1
got	1
into	1
yashvin	1
s	1
hired	1
fly	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
driver	1
to	1
drive	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
roomy	1
old	1
fashioned	1
fly	1
with	1
seats	1
for	1
four	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
stretched	1
his	1
legs	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
front	1
seat	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
meditation	1
a	1
vague	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
into	1
which	1
his	1
affairs	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
a	1
vague	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
friendliness	1
and	1
flattery	1
of	1
serpuhovskoy	1
who	1
had	1
considered	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
needed	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
interview	1
before	1
him	1
all	1
blended	1
into	1
a	1
general	1
joyous	1
sense	1
of	1
life	1
this	1
feeling	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
he	1
dropped	1
his	1
legs	1
crossed	1
one	1
leg	1
over	1
the	1
other	1
knee	1
and	1
taking	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
felt	1
the	1
springy	1
muscle	1
of	1
the	1
calf	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
grazed	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
by	1
his	1
fall	1
and	1
leaning	1
back	1
he	1
drew	1
several	1
deep	1
breaths	1
i	1
m	1
happy	1
very	1
happy	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
before	1
had	1
this	1
sense	1
of	1
physical	1
joy	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
as	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
slight	1
ache	1
in	1
his	1
strong	1
leg	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
muscular	1
sensation	1
of	1
movement	1
in	1
his	1
chest	1
as	1
he	1
breathed	1
the	1
bright	1
cold	1
august	1
day	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
anna	1
feel	1
so	1
hopeless	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
keenly	1
stimulating	1
and	1
refreshed	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
neck	1
that	1
still	1
tingled	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
water	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
brilliantine	1
on	1
his	1
whiskers	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
particularly	1
pleasant	1
in	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
everything	1
he	1
saw	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
window	1
everything	1
in	1
that	1
cold	1
pure	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
pale	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sunset	1
was	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
gay	1
and	1
strong	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
shining	1
in	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
the	1
sharp	1
outlines	1
of	1
fences	1
and	1
angles	1
of	1
buildings	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
passers	1
by	1
the	1
carriages	1
that	1
met	1
him	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
motionless	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
grass	1
the	1
fields	1
with	1
evenly	1
drawn	1
furrows	1
of	1
potatoes	1
and	1
the	1
slanting	1
shadows	1
that	1
fell	1
from	1
the	1
houses	1
and	1
trees	1
and	1
bushes	1
and	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
potatoes	1
everything	1
was	1
bright	1
like	1
a	1
pretty	1
landscape	1
just	1
finished	1
and	1
freshly	1
varnished	1
get	1
on	1
get	1
on	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
driver	1
putting	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
pulling	1
a	1
three	1
rouble	1
note	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
he	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
the	1
driver	1
s	1
hand	1
fumbled	1
with	1
something	1
at	1
the	1
lamp	1
the	1
whip	1
cracked	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
rolled	1
rapidly	1
along	1
the	1
smooth	1
highroad	1
i	1
want	1
nothing	1
nothing	1
but	1
this	1
happiness	1
he	1
thought	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
bone	1
button	1
of	1
the	1
bell	1
in	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
windows	1
and	1
picturing	1
to	1
himself	1
anna	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
last	1
time	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
go	1
on	1
i	1
love	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
here	1
s	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
vrede	1
villa	1
whereabouts	1
will	1
she	1
be	1
where	1
how	1
why	1
did	1
she	1
fix	1
on	1
this	1
place	1
to	1
meet	1
me	1
and	1
why	1
does	1
she	1
write	1
in	1
betsy	1
s	1
letter	1
he	1
thought	1
wondering	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
at	1
it	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
wonder	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
driver	1
to	1
stop	1
before	1
reaching	1
the	1
avenue	1
and	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
moving	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
avenue	1
that	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
avenue	1
but	1
looking	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
hidden	1
by	1
a	1
veil	1
but	1
he	1
drank	1
in	1
with	1
glad	1
eyes	1
the	1
special	1
movement	1
in	1
walking	1
peculiar	1
to	1
her	1
alone	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
the	1
shoulders	1
and	1
the	1
setting	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
electric	1
shock	1
ran	1
all	1
over	1
him	1
with	1
fresh	1
force	1
he	1
felt	1
conscious	1
of	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
springy	1
motions	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
to	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
his	1
lungs	1
as	1
he	1
breathed	1
and	1
something	1
set	1
his	1
lips	1
twitching	1
joining	1
him	1
she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
tightly	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
angry	1
that	1
i	1
sent	1
for	1
you	1
i	1
absolutely	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
serious	1
and	1
set	1
line	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
under	1
the	1
veil	1
transformed	1
his	1
mood	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
angry	1
but	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
where	1
from	1
never	1
mind	1
she	1
said	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
come	1
along	1
i	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
interview	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
joyous	1
one	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
without	1
knowing	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
her	1
distress	1
he	1
already	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
distress	1
unconsciously	1
passing	1
over	1
him	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
what	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
squeezing	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
elbow	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
read	1
her	1
thoughts	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
walked	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
in	1
silence	1
gathering	1
up	1
her	1
courage	1
then	1
suddenly	1
she	1
stopped	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
yesterday	1
she	1
began	1
breathing	1
quickly	1
and	1
painfully	1
that	1
coming	1
home	1
with	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
he	1
heard	1
her	1
unconsciously	1
bending	1
his	1
whole	1
figure	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
hoping	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
to	1
soften	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
for	1
her	1
but	1
directly	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
suddenly	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
a	1
proud	1
and	1
hard	1
expression	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
yes	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
better	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
better	1
i	1
know	1
how	1
painful	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
she	1
was	1
reading	1
his	1
thoughts	1
from	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
that	1
that	1
expression	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
idea	1
that	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
vronsky	1
that	1
a	1
duel	1
was	1
now	1
inevitable	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
duel	1
had	1
never	1
crossed	1
her	1
mind	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
put	1
a	1
different	1
interpretation	1
on	1
this	1
passing	1
expression	1
of	1
hardness	1
when	1
she	1
got	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
letter	1
she	1
knew	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
will	1
to	1
forego	1
her	1
position	1
to	1
abandon	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
lover	1
the	1
morning	1
spent	1
at	1
princess	1
tverskaya	1
s	1
had	1
confirmed	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
in	1
this	1
but	1
this	1
interview	1
was	1
still	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
gravity	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
hoped	1
that	1
this	1
interview	1
would	1
transform	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
save	1
her	1
if	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
news	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
resolutely	1
passionately	1
without	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
wavering	1
throw	1
up	1
everything	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
up	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
this	1
news	1
had	1
not	1
produced	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
simply	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
resenting	1
some	1
affront	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
painful	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
happened	1
of	1
itself	1
she	1
said	1
irritably	1
and	1
see	1
she	1
pulled	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
letter	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
glove	1
i	1
understand	1
i	1
understand	1
he	1
interrupted	1
her	1
taking	1
the	1
letter	1
but	1
not	1
reading	1
it	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
longed	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
prayed	1
for	1
was	1
to	1
cut	1
short	1
this	1
position	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
devote	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
your	1
happiness	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
i	1
can	1
doubt	1
it	1
if	1
i	1
doubted	1
who	1
s	1
that	1
coming	1
said	1
vronsky	1
suddenly	1
pointing	1
to	1
two	1
ladies	1
walking	1
towards	1
them	1
perhaps	1
they	1
know	1
us	1
and	1
he	1
hurriedly	1
turned	1
off	1
drawing	1
her	1
after	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
side	1
path	1
oh	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
she	1
said	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
quivering	1
and	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
her	1
eyes	1
looked	1
with	1
strange	1
fury	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
veil	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
point	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
doubt	1
that	1
but	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
writes	1
to	1
me	1
read	1
it	1
she	1
stood	1
still	1
again	1
again	1
just	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
hearing	1
of	1
her	1
rupture	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
vronsky	1
on	1
reading	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
unconsciously	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
natural	1
sensation	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
betrayed	1
husband	1
now	1
while	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
picturing	1
the	1
challenge	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
most	1
likely	1
find	1
at	1
home	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow	1
and	1
the	1
duel	1
itself	1
in	1
which	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
cold	1
and	1
haughty	1
expression	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
assuming	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
he	1
would	1
await	1
the	1
injured	1
husband	1
s	1
shot	1
after	1
having	1
himself	1
fired	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
there	1
flashed	1
across	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
serpuhovskoy	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
been	1
thinking	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
bind	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
thought	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
her	1
having	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
determination	1
in	1
them	1
she	1
saw	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
it	1
before	1
by	1
himself	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
all	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
her	1
last	1
hope	1
had	1
failed	1
her	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
reckoning	1
on	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
is	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
shaking	1
voice	1
he	1
forgive	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
rejoice	1
at	1
it	1
vronsky	1
interrupted	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
let	1
me	1
finish	1
he	1
added	1
his	1
eyes	1
imploring	1
her	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
words	1
i	1
rejoice	1
because	1
things	1
cannot	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
remain	1
as	1
he	1
supposes	1
why	1
can	1
t	1
they	1
anna	1
said	1
restraining	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
obviously	1
attaching	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
consequence	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
her	1
fate	1
was	1
sealed	1
vronsky	1
meant	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
duel	1
inevitable	1
he	1
thought	1
things	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1

before	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
different	1

on	1
i	1
hope	1
that	1
now	1
you	1
will	1

i	1
hope	1
he	1
was	1
confused	1
and	1
reddened	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
arrange	1
and	1
plan	1
our	1
life	1
tomorrow	1

was	1
beginning	1

not	1

him	1

on	1

my	1
child	1
she	1
shrieked	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
writes	1
i	1

have	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
and	1
i	1

and	1
won	1

do	1
that	1

for	1
god	1

up	1

degrading	1
position	1

said	1
in	1
a	1
shaking	1
voice	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
now	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
was	1
untrue	1
she	1
had	1
nothing	1
left	1
her	1
but	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
love	1
him	1

from	1
the	1
day	1

strong	1
that	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
humiliating	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
proud	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
because	1
proud	1
of	1
being	1
proud	1

could	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
proud	1
of	1
tears	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
despair	1
choked	1
her	1
utterance	1
she	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
sobbed	1
he	1
felt	1
too	1
something	1
swelling	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
twitching	1
in	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
felt	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
weeping	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
touched	1
him	1
so	1
he	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
her	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
her	1
wretchedness	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
something	1
wrong	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
divorce	1

he	1
said	1
feebly	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
not	1
answering	1
couldn	1
t	1
you	1
take	1
your	1
son	1
and	1
still	1

on	1
him	1

said	1
shortly	1
her	1
presentiment	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
again	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1

23	1
on	1
monday	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
usual	1
sitting	1
of	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
the	1
2nd	1
of	1
june	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
the	1
sitting	1
was	1
held	1
greeted	1
the	1
members	1
and	1
the	1
president	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
putting	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
papers	1
laid	1
ready	1
before	1
him	1
among	1
these	1
papers	1
lay	1
the	1
necessary	1
evidence	1
and	1
a	1
rough	1
outline	1
of	1
the	1
speech	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
make	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
need	1
these	1
documents	1
he	1
remembered	1
every	1
point	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
enemy	1
facing	1
him	1
and	1
studiously	1
endeavoring	1
to	1
assume	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
indifference	1
his	1
speech	1
would	1
flow	1
of	1
itself	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
prepare	1
it	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
import	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
was	1
of	1
such	1
magnitude	1
that	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
weight	1
meantime	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
report	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
most	1
innocent	1
and	1
inoffensive	1
air	1
no	1
one	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
white	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
swollen	1
veins	1
and	1
long	1
fingers	1
so	1
softly	1
stroking	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
paper	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
weariness	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
head	1
drooped	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
would	1
have	1
suspected	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
a	1
torrent	1
of	1
words	1
would	1
flow	1
from	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
would	1
arouse	1
a	1
fearful	1
storm	1
set	1
the	1
members	1
shouting	1
and	1
attacking	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
force	1
the	1
president	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
order	1
when	1
the	1
report	1
was	1
over	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
announced	1
in	1
his	1
subdued	1
delicate	1
voice	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
several	1
points	1
to	1
bring	1
before	1
the	1
meeting	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
commission	1
for	1
the	1
reorganization	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
all	1
attention	1
was	1
turned	1
upon	1
him	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
opponent	1
but	1
selecting	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
delivering	1
his	1
speeches	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
him	1
an	1
inoffensive	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
never	1
had	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
in	1
the	1
commission	1
began	1
to	1
expound	1
his	1
views	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
point	1
about	1
the	1
fundamental	1
and	1
radical	1
law	1
his	1
opponent	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
protest	1
stremov	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
commission	1
and	1
also	1
stung	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
began	1
defending	1
himself	1
and	1
altogether	1
a	1
stormy	1
sitting	1
followed	1
but	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
triumphed	1
and	1
his	1
motion	1
was	1
carried	1
three	1
new	1
commissions	1
were	1
appointed	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
petersburg	1
circle	1
nothing	1
else	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
but	1
this	1
sitting	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
success	1
had	1
been	1
even	1
greater	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
anticipated	1
next	1
morning	1
tuesday	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
on	1
waking	1
up	1
recollected	1
with	1
pleasure	1
his	1
triumph	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
though	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
appear	1
indifferent	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
anxious	1
to	1
flatter	1
him	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
rumors	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
him	1
concerning	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
commission	1
absorbed	1
in	1
business	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
tuesday	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
and	1
received	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
annoyance	1
when	1
a	1
servant	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
arrival	1
anna	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
petersburg	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
carriage	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
her	1
telegram	1
and	1
so	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
of	1
her	1
arrival	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
arrived	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
meet	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
gone	1
out	1
but	1
was	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
secretary	1
she	1
sent	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
occupied	1
herself	1
in	1
sorting	1
out	1
her	1
things	1
expecting	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
an	1
hour	1
passed	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
giving	1
some	1
directions	1
and	1
spoke	1
loudly	1
on	1
purpose	1
expecting	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
there	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
though	1
she	1
heard	1
him	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
study	1
as	1
he	1
parted	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
usually	1
went	1
out	1
quickly	1
to	1
his	1
office	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
before	1
that	1
so	1
that	1
their	1
attitude	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
might	1
be	1
defined	1
she	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
resolutely	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
official	1
uniform	1
obviously	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
rested	1
his	1
elbows	1
looking	1
dejectedly	1
before	1
him	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
risen	1
but	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
then	1
his	1
face	1
flushed	1
hotly	1
a	1
thing	1
anna	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
quickly	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
above	1
them	1
at	1
her	1
forehead	1
and	1
hair	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
obviously	1
wishing	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
he	1
stuttered	1
several	1
times	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
stopped	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
preparing	1
herself	1
for	1
meeting	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
schooled	1
herself	1
to	1
despise	1
and	1
reproach	1
him	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
silence	1
lasted	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
is	1
seryozha	1
quite	1
well	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
he	1
added	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
dining	1
at	1
home	1
today	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
directly	1
i	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
moscow	1
she	1
said	1
no	1
you	1
did	1
quite	1
quite	1
right	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
again	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
powerless	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
began	1
herself	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyes	1
under	1
his	1
persistent	1
gaze	1
at	1
her	1
hair	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
guilty	1
woman	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
bad	1
woman	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
as	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
then	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
change	1
nothing	1
i	1
have	1
asked	1
you	1
no	1
question	1
about	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
resolutely	1
and	1
with	1
hatred	1
looking	1
her	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
that	1
was	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
supposed	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
anger	1
he	1
apparently	1
regained	1
complete	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
faculties	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
then	1
and	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
thin	1
shrill	1
voice	1
i	1
repeat	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
know	1
this	1
i	1
ignore	1
it	1
not	1
all	1
wives	1
are	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
communicate	1
such	1
agreeable	1
news	1
to	1
their	1
husbands	1
he	1
laid	1
special	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
agreeable	1
i	1
shall	1
ignore	1
it	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
knows	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
not	1
disgraced	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
simply	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1
our	1
relations	1
must	1
be	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
always	1
been	1
and	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
your	1
compromising	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
steps	1
to	1
secure	1
my	1
honor	1
but	1
our	1
relations	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
always	1
anna	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
timid	1
voice	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1

for	1

the	1

which	1

of	1

at	1

never	1
it	1

so	1
many	1
hindrances	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
quarrels	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
peasants	1
as	1
that	1
year	1
and	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
these	1
failures	1
and	1
this	1
hostility	1
was	1
now	1
perfectly	1
comprehensible	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
delight	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
itself	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
greater	1
intimacy	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
the	1
envy	1
he	1
felt	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
life	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
adopt	1
that	1
life	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
night	1
not	1
a	1
dream	1
but	1
an	1
intention	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
out	1
in	1
detail	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
so	1
transformed	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
farming	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
managed	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
former	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
that	1
unpleasant	1
relation	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
workpeople	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
improved	1
cows	1
such	1
as	1
pava	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
ploughed	1
over	1
and	1
enriched	1
the	1
nine	1
level	1
fields	1
surrounded	1
with	1
hedges	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
acres	1
heavily	1
manured	1
the	1
seed	1
sown	1
in	1
drills	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
splendid	1
if	1
only	1
the	1
work	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
for	1
themselves	1
or	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
comrades	1
people	1
in	1
sympathy	1
with	1
them	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
now	1
his	1
work	1
on	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
agriculture	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
chief	1
element	1
in	1
husbandry	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
laborer	1
greatly	1
assisted	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
farming	1
he	1
was	1
carrying	1
on	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
cruel	1
and	1
stubborn	1
struggle	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
laborers	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
his	1
side	1
a	1
continual	1
intense	1
effort	1
to	1
change	1
everything	1
to	1
a	1
pattern	1
he	1
considered	1
better	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
the	1
natural	1
order	1
of	1
things	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
struggle	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
with	1
immense	1
expenditure	1
of	1
force	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
effort	1
or	1
even	1
intention	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
attained	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
liking	1
of	1
either	1
side	1
and	1
that	1
splendid	1
tools	1
splendid	1
cattle	1
and	1
land	1
were	1
spoiled	1
with	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
anyone	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
energy	1
expended	1
on	1
this	1
work	1
was	1
not	1
simply	1
wasted	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
now	1
since	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
system	1
had	1
become	1
clear	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
his	1
energy	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
unworthy	1
one	1
in	1
reality	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
struggle	1
about	1
he	1
was	1
struggling	1
for	1
every	1
farthing	1
of	1
his	1
share	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
it	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
relax	1
his	1
efforts	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
laborers	1
wages	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
struggling	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
their	1
work	1
easily	1
and	1
agreeably	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
used	1
to	1
doing	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
his	1
interests	1
that	1
every	1
laborer	1
should	1
work	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
that	1
while	1
doing	1
so	1
he	1
should	1
keep	1
his	1
wits	1
about	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
winnowing	1
machines	1
the	1
horse	1
rakes	1
the	1
thrashing	1
machines	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
attend	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
what	1
the	1
laborer	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
work	1
as	1
pleasantly	1
as	1
possible	1
with	1
rests	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
carelessly	1
and	1
heedlessly	1
without	1
thinking	1
that	1
summer	1
levin	1
saw	1
this	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
he	1
sent	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
mow	1
some	1
clover	1
for	1
hay	1
picking	1
out	1
the	1
worst	1
patches	1
where	1
the	1
clover	1
was	1
overgrown	1
with	1
grass	1
and	1
weeds	1
and	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
for	1
seed	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
they	1
mowed	1
the	1
best	1
acres	1
of	1
clover	1
justifying	1
themselves	1
by	1
the	1
pretense	1
that	1
the	1
bailiff	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
pacify	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
assurance	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
splendid	1
hay	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
owing	1
to	1
those	1
acres	1
being	1
so	1
much	1
easier	1
to	1
mow	1
he	1
sent	1
out	1
a	1
hay	1
machine	1
for	1
pitching	1
the	1
hay	1
it	1
was	1
broken	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
dull	1
work	1
for	1
a	1
peasant	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
in	1
front	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
wings	1
waving	1
above	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
don	1
t	1
trouble	1
your	1
honor	1
sure	1
the	1
womenfolks	1
will	1
pitch	1
it	1
quick	1
enough	1
the	1
ploughs	1
were	1
practically	1
useless	1
because	1
it	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
the	1
laborer	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
share	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
plough	1
and	1
forcing	1
it	1
round	1
he	1
strained	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
tore	1
up	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
levin	1
was	1
begged	1
not	1
to	1
mind	1
about	1
it	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
stray	1
into	1
the	1
wheat	1
because	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
laborer	1
would	1
consent	1
to	1
be	1
night	1
watchman	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
laborers	1
insisted	1
on	1
taking	1
turns	1
for	1
night	1
duty	1
and	1
ivan	1
after	1
working	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
fell	1
asleep	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
penitent	1
for	1
his	1
fault	1
saying	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
to	1
me	1
your	1
honor	1
they	1
killed	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
calves	1
by	1
letting	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
clover	1
aftermath	1
without	1
care	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
drinking	1
and	1
nothing	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
men	1
believe	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
blown	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
clover	1
but	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
consolation	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
neighbors	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
twelve	1
head	1
of	1
cattle	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
all	1
this	1
happened	1
not	1
because	1
anyone	1
felt	1
ill	1
will	1
to	1
levin	1
or	1
his	1
farm	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
liked	1
him	1
thought	1
him	1
a	1
simple	1
gentleman	1
their	1
highest	1
praise	1
but	1
it	1
happened	1
simply	1
because	1
all	1
they	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
work	1
merrily	1
and	1
carelessly	1
and	1
his	1
interests	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
remote	1
and	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
fatally	1
opposed	1
to	1
their	1
most	1
just	1
claims	1
long	1
before	1
levin	1
had	1
felt	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
position	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
he	1
saw	1
where	1
his	1
boat	1
leaked	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
leak	1
perhaps	1
purposely	1
deceiving	1
himself	1
nothing	1
would	1
be	1
left	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
lost	1
faith	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
could	1
deceive	1
himself	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
farming	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
managing	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
not	1
merely	1
unattractive	1
but	1
revolting	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
take	1
no	1
further	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
this	1
now	1
was	1
joined	1
the	1
presence	1
only	1
twenty	1
five	1
miles	1
off	1
of	1
kitty	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
whom	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
oblonskaya	1
had	1
invited	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
over	1
there	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
renewing	1
his	1
offer	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
who	1
would	1
so	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
understand	1
accept	1
him	1
now	1
levin	1
himself	1
had	1
felt	1
on	1
seeing	1
kitty	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
oblonskys	1
knowing	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
refused	1
him	1
had	1
placed	1
an	1
insuperable	1
barrier	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
him	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
ask	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
wife	1
merely	1
because	1
she	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
marry	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
made	1
him	1
cold	1
and	1
hostile	1
to	1
her	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
without	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
reproach	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
without	1
resentment	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
only	1
hate	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
as	1
she	1
s	1
bound	1
to	1
and	1
besides	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
now	1
after	1
what	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
told	1
me	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
can	1
i	1
help	1
showing	1
that	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
and	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
magnanimously	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
and	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
her	1
me	1
go	1
through	1
a	1
performance	1
before	1
her	1
of	1
forgiving	1
and	1
deigning	1
to	1
bestow	1
my	1
love	1
on	1
her	1
what	1
induced	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
by	1
chance	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
then	1
everything	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
of	1
itself	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
asking	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
side	1
saddle	1
for	1
kitty	1
s	1
use	1
i	1
m	1
told	1
you	1

a	1
side	1

she	1
wrote	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
bring	1
it	1
over	1
yourself	1
this	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
stand	1
how	1
could	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
any	1
intelligence	1
of	1
any	1
delicacy	1

to	1
take	1
tea	1
with	1

i	1

some	1
today	1

said	1
the	1

obviously	1
accepting	1
the	1
invitation	1
with	1
pleasure	1
but	1
just	1
a	1
glass	1
for	1
company	1
over	1
their	1
tea	1
levin	1
heard	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
farming	1
ten	1
years	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
rented	1
three	1
hundred	1
acres	1
from	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
owned	1
them	1
and	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
them	1
and	1
rented	1
another	1
three	1
hundred	1
from	1
a	1
neighboring	1
landowner	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
the	1
worst	1
part	1
he	1
let	1
out	1
for	1
rent	1
while	1
a	1
hundred	1
acres	1
of	1
arable	1
land	1
he	1
cultivated	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
two	1
hired	1
laborers	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
complained	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
doing	1
badly	1
but	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
simply	1
did	1
so	1
from	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
propriety	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
farm	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
flourishing	1
condition	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
unsuccessful	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
bought	1
land	1
at	1
thirty	1
five	1
roubles	1
the	1
acre	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
married	1
his	1
three	1
sons	1
and	1
a	1
nephew	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
rebuilt	1
twice	1
after	1
fires	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
on	1
a	1
larger	1
scale	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
complaints	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
proud	1
and	1
justly	1
proud	1
of	1
his	1
prosperity	1
proud	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
his	1
nephew	1
his	1
sons	1
wives	1
his	1
horses	1
and	1
his	1
cows	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
keeping	1
all	1
this	1
farming	1
going	1
from	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1

was	1
not	1
averse	1
to	1
new	1
methods	1
either	1
he	1
had	1
planted	1
a	1
great	1
many	1

his	1

as	1
levin	1
had	1
seen	1
driving	1

already	1
past	1
flowering	1

beginning	1
to	1
die	1
down	1
while	1
levin	1
s	1
were	1
only	1
just	1
coming	1
into	1
flower	1
he	1
earthed	1
up	1
his	1
potatoes	1
with	1
a	1
modern	1
plough	1
borrowed	1
from	1
a	1
neighboring	1
landowner	1
he	1
sowed	1
wheat	1
the	1
trifling	1
fact	1
that	1
thinning	1
out	1

the	1
old	1
man	1
used	1
the	1

he	1
thinned	1
out	1
for	1
his	1
horses	1
specially	1
struck	1
levin	1
how	1
many	1
times	1
had	1
levin	1
seen	1
this	1
splendid	1
fodder	1
wasted	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
saved	1
but	1
always	1
it	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
impossible	1
the	1
peasant	1
got	1
this	1
done	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
enough	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
it	1
as	1

knowledge	1
poisoned	1
the	1
pleasure	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
sviazhsky	1
on	1
getting	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
letter	1
with	1
the	1
invitation	1
for	1
shooting	1
levin	1
had	1
immediately	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
having	1
such	1
views	1
for	1
him	1
was	1
simply	1
his	1
own	1
groundless	1
supposition	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
besides	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
try	1
himself	1
put	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
test	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
girl	1
the	1
sviazhskys	1
home	1
life	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
pleasant	1
and	1
sviazhsky	1
himself	1
the	1
best	1
type	1
of	1
man	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
local	1
affairs	1
that	1
levin	1
knew	1
was	1
very	1
interesting	1
to	1
him	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
always	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
wonder	1
to	1
levin	1
whose	1
convictions	1
very	1
logical	1
though	1
never	1
original	1
go	1
one	1
way	1
by	1
themselves	1
while	1
their	1
life	1
exceedingly	1
definite	1
and	1
firm	1
in	1
its	1
direction	1
goes	1
its	1
way	1
quite	1
apart	1
and	1
almost	1
always	1
in	1
direct	1
contradiction	1
to	1
their	1
convictions	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
an	1
extremely	1
advanced	1
man	1
he	1
despised	1
the	1
nobility	1
and	1
believed	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
to	1
be	1
secretly	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
serfdom	1
and	1
only	1
concealing	1
their	1
views	1
from	1
cowardice	1
he	1
regarded	1
russia	1
as	1
a	1
ruined	1
country	1
rather	1
after	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
turkey	1
and	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
russia	1
as	1
so	1
bad	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
permitted	1
himself	1
to	1
criticize	1
its	1
doings	1
seriously	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
functionary	1
of	1
that	1
government	1
and	1
a	1
model	1
marshal	1
of	1
nobility	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
drove	1
about	1
he	1
always	1
wore	1
the	1
cockade	1
of	1
office	1
and	1
the	1
cap	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
band	1
he	1
considered	1
human	1
life	1
only	1
tolerable	1
abroad	1
and	1
went	1
abroad	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
every	1
opportunity	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
carried	1
on	1
a	1
complex	1
and	1
improved	1
system	1
of	1
agriculture	1
in	1
russia	1
and	1
with	1
extreme	1
interest	1
followed	1
everything	1
and	1
knew	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
in	1
russia	1
he	1
considered	1
the	1
russian	1
peasant	1
as	1
occupying	1
a	1
stage	1
of	1
development	1
intermediate	1
between	1
the	1
ape	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
local	1
assemblies	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
readier	1
to	1
shake	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
listen	1
to	1
their	1
opinion	1
he	1
believed	1
neither	1
in	1
god	1
nor	1
the	1
devil	1
but	1
was	1
much	1
concerned	1
about	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
the	1
clergy	1
and	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
their	1
revenues	1
and	1
took	1
special	1
trouble	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
his	1
village	1
on	1
the	1
woman	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
extreme	1
advocates	1
of	1
complete	1
liberty	1
for	1
women	1
and	1
especially	1
their	1
right	1
to	1
labor	1
but	1
he	1
lived	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
on	1
such	1
terms	1
that	1
their	1
affectionate	1
childless	1
home	1
life	1
was	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
everyone	1
and	1
arranged	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
life	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
nothing	1
and	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
share	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
efforts	1
that	1
her	1
time	1
should	1
pass	1
as	1
happily	1
and	1
as	1
agreeably	1
as	1
possible	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
characteristic	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
interpretation	1
on	1
people	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
character	1
would	1
have	1
presented	1
no	1
doubt	1
or	1
difficulty	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
fool	1
or	1
a	1
knave	1
and	1
everything	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
clear	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
fool	1
because	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
clever	1
and	1
moreover	1
a	1
highly	1
cultivated	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
modest	1
over	1
his	1
culture	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
subject	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
display	1
his	1
knowledge	1
except	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
still	1
less	1
could	1
levin	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
knave	1
as	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
an	1
honest	1
good	1
hearted	1
sensible	1
man	1
who	1
worked	1
good	1
humoredly	1
keenly	1
and	1
perseveringly	1
at	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
was	1
held	1
in	1
high	1
honor	1
by	1
everyone	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
certainly	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
consciously	1
done	1
and	1
was	1
indeed	1
incapable	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
base	1
levin	1
tried	1
to	1
understand	1
him	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
life	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
living	1
enigma	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
were	1
very	1
friendly	1
and	1
so	1
levin	1
used	1
to	1
venture	1
to	1
sound	1
sviazhsky	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
foundation	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
vain	1
every	1
time	1
levin	1
tried	1
to	1
penetrate	1
beyond	1
the	1
outer	1
chambers	1
of	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
mind	1
which	1
were	1
hospitably	1
open	1
to	1
all	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
slightly	1
disconcerted	1
faint	1
signs	1
of	1
alarm	1
were	1
visible	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
afraid	1
levin	1
would	1
understand	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
kindly	1
good	1
humored	1
repulse	1
just	1
now	1
since	1
his	1
disenchantment	1
with	1
farming	1
levin	1
was	1
particularly	1
glad	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
sviazhsky	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
happy	1
and	1
affectionate	1
couple	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
themselves	1
and	1
everyone	1
else	1
and	1
their	1
well	1
ordered	1
home	1
had	1
always	1
a	1
cheering	1
effect	1
on	1
levin	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
longing	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
that	1
secret	1
in	1
sviazhsky	1
that	1
gave	1
him	1
such	1
clearness	1
definiteness	1
and	1
good	1
courage	1
in	1
life	1
moreover	1
levin	1
knew	1
that	1
at	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
he	1
should	1
meet	1
the	1
landowners	1
of	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
particularly	1
interesting	1
for	1
him	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
those	1
rural	1
conversations	1
concerning	1
crops	1
laborers	1
wages	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
are	1
conventionally	1
regarded	1
as	1
something	1
very	1
low	1
but	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
constitute	1
the	1
one	1
subject	1
of	1
importance	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
perhaps	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
serfdom	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
england	1
in	1
both	1
cases	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
agriculture	1
are	1
firmly	1
established	1
but	1
among	1
us	1
now	1
when	1
everything	1
has	1
been	1
turned	1
upside	1
down	1
and	1
is	1
only	1
just	1
taking	1
shape	1
the	1
question	1
what	1
form	1
these	1
conditions	1
will	1
take	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
question	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
russia	1
thought	1
levin	1
the	1
shooting	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
levin	1
had	1
expected	1
the	1
marsh	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
grouse	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
and	1
only	1
brought	1
back	1
three	1
birds	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
back	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
from	1
shooting	1
an	1
excellent	1
appetite	1
excellent	1
spirits	1
and	1
that	1
keen	1
intellectual	1
mood	1
which	1
with	1
him	1
always	1
accompanied	1
violent	1
physical	1
exertion	1
and	1
while	1
out	1
shooting	1
when	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
suddenly	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
kept	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
them	1
seemed	1
to	1
claim	1
not	1
merely	1
his	1
attention	1
but	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
some	1
question	1
connected	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
tea	1
two	1
landowners	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
about	1
some	1
business	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
wardship	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
and	1
the	1
interesting	1
conversation	1
levin	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
sprang	1
up	1
levin	1
was	1
sitting	1
beside	1
his	1
hostess	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table	1
and	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
him	1
madame	1
sviazhskaya	1
was	1
a	1
round	1
faced	1
fair	1
haired	1
rather	1
short	1
woman	1
all	1
smiles	1
and	1
dimples	1
levin	1
tried	1
through	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
weighty	1
enigma	1
her	1
husband	1
presented	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
complete	1
freedom	1
of	1
ideas	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
this	1
agony	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dress	1
specially	1
put	1
on	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
for	1
his	1
benefit	1
cut	1
particularly	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
trapeze	1
on	1
her	1
white	1
bosom	1
this	1
quadrangular	1
opening	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
bosom	1
s	1
being	1
very	1
white	1
or	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
white	1
deprived	1
levin	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
faculties	1
he	1
imagined	1
probably	1
mistakenly	1
that	1
this	1
low	1
necked	1
bodice	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
on	1
his	1
account	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
low	1
necked	1
bodice	1
having	1
been	1
made	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
deceived	1
someone	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
explain	1
something	1
but	1
that	1
to	1
explain	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
blushing	1
was	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
awkward	1
his	1
awkwardness	1
infected	1
the	1
pretty	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
too	1
but	1
their	1
hostess	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
observe	1
this	1
and	1
kept	1
purposely	1
drawing	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
you	1
say	1
she	1
said	1
pursuing	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
started	1
that	1
my	1
husband	1
cannot	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
s	1
russian	1
it	1
s	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
in	1
cheerful	1
spirits	1
abroad	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
here	1
here	1
he	1
feels	1
in	1
his	1
proper	1
place	1
he	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
interesting	1
himself	1
in	1
everything	1
oh	1

levin	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
above	1
the	1
open	1
neck	1
but	1
feeling	1
that	1
wherever	1
he	1
looked	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
he	1
should	1
see	1
it	1
yes	1
i	1

and	1
conscious	1
of	1
doing	1
a	1
rude	1
thing	1
but	1
incapable	1
of	1
continuing	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
blushing	1
i	1
hear	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
conversation	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
sitting	1
sideways	1
with	1
one	1
elbow	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
a	1
cup	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
he	1
gathered	1
up	1
his	1
beard	1
held	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
drop	1
again	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
smelling	1
it	1
his	1
brilliant	1
black	1
eyes	1
were	1
looking	1
straight	1
at	1
the	1
excited	1
country	1
gentleman	1
with	1
gray	1

apparently	1
he	1
derived	1
amusement	1
from	1
his	1
remarks	1
the	1
gentleman	1
was	1
complaining	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
to	1
levin	1
that	1
sviazhsky	1
knew	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
gentleman	1
s	1
complaints	1
which	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
demolish	1
his	1
whole	1
contention	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
this	1
answer	1
and	1
listened	1
not	1
without	1
pleasure	1
to	1
the	1
landowner	1
s	1
comic	1
speeches	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
was	1
obviously	1
an	1
inveterate	1
adherent	1
of	1
serfdom	1
and	1
a	1
devoted	1
agriculturist	1
who	1
had	1
lived	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
levin	1
saw	1
proofs	1
of	1
this	1
in	1
his	1
dress	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
fashioned	1
threadbare	1
coat	1
obviously	1
not	1
his	1
everyday	1
attire	1
in	1
his	1
shrewd	1
deep	1
set	1
eyes	1
in	1
his	1
idiomatic	1
fluent	1
russian	1
in	1
the	1
imperious	1
tone	1
that	1
had	1
become	1
habitual	1
from	1
long	1
use	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
resolute	1
gestures	1
of	1
his	1
large	1
red	1
sunburnt	1
hands	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
betrothal	1
ring	1

if	1
i	1
d	1
only	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
throw	1
up	1
what	1
s	1
been	1
set	1
going	1
such	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
trouble	1
wasted	1
i	1
d	1
turn	1
my	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
sell	1
up	1
go	1
off	1
like	1
nikolay	1
ivanovitch	1
to	1
hear	1
la	1
belle	1
hélène	1
said	1
the	1
landowner	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
lighting	1
up	1
his	1
shrewd	1
old	1
face	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
throw	1
it	1
up	1
said	1
nikolay	1
ivanovitch	1
sviazhsky	1
so	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
gained	1
the	1
only	1
gain	1
is	1
that	1
i	1
live	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
house	1
neither	1
bought	1
nor	1
hired	1
besides	1
one	1
keeps	1
hoping	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
learn	1
sense	1
though	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
you	1
d	1
never	1
believe	1
it	1
the	1
drunkenness	1
the	1
immorality	1
they	1
keep	1
chopping	1
and	1
changing	1
their	1
bits	1
of	1
land	1
not	1
a	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
horse	1
or	1
a	1
cow	1
the	1
peasant	1
s	1
dying	1
of	1
hunger	1
but	1
just	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
laborer	1
he	1
ll	1
do	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
a	1
mischief	1
and	1
then	1
bring	1
you	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
but	1
then	1
you	1
make	1
complaints	1
to	1
the	1
justice	1
too	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
i	1
lodge	1
complaints	1
not	1
for	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
such	1
a	1
talking	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
cause	1
to	1
regret	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
works	1
for	1
instance	1
they	1
pocketed	1
the	1
advance	1
money	1
and	1
made	1
off	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
justice	1
do	1
why	1
acquitted	1
them	1
nothing	1
keeps	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
but	1
their	1
own	1
communal	1
court	1
and	1
their	1
village	1
elder	1
he	1
ll	1
flog	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
style	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
there	1
d	1
be	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
and	1
run	1
away	1
obviously	1
the	1
landowner	1
was	1
chaffing	1
sviazhsky	1
who	1
far	1
from	1
resenting	1
it	1
was	1
apparently	1
amused	1
by	1
it	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
we	1
manage	1
our	1
land	1
without	1
such	1
extreme	1
measures	1
said	1
he	1
smiling	1
levin	1
and	1
i	1
and	1
this	1
gentleman	1
he	1
indicated	1
the	1
other	1
landowner	1
yes	1
the	1
thing	1
s	1
done	1
at	1
mihail	1
petrovitch	1
s	1
but	1
ask	1
him	1
how	1
it	1
s	1
done	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
that	1
a	1
rational	1
system	1
said	1
the	1
landowner	1
obviously	1
rather	1
proud	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
rational	1
my	1
system	1
s	1
very	1
simple	1
said	1
mihail	1
petrovitch	1
thank	1
god	1
all	1
my	1
management	1
rests	1
on	1
getting	1
the	1
money	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
autumn	1
taxes	1
and	1
the	1
peasants	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
father	1
master	1
help	1
us	1
well	1
the	1
peasants	1
are	1
all	1
one	1
s	1
neighbors	1
one	1
feels	1
for	1
them	1
so	1
one	1
advances	1
them	1
a	1
third	1
but	1
one	1
says	1
remember	1
lads	1
i	1
have	1
helped	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
help	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
need	1
it	1
whether	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
sowing	1
of	1
the	1
oats	1
or	1
the	1
haycutting	1
or	1
the	1
harvest	1
and	1
well	1
one	1
agrees	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
each	1
taxpayer	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
dishonest	1
ones	1
among	1
them	1
too	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
levin	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
familiar	1
with	1
these	1
patriarchal	1
methods	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
interrupted	1
mihail	1
petrovitch	1
turning	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
then	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
asked	1
what	1
system	1
is	1
one	1
to	1
adopt	1
nowadays	1
why	1
manage	1
like	1
mihail	1
petrovitch	1
or	1
let	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
half	1
the	1
crop	1
or	1
for	1
rent	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
do	1
only	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
how	1
the	1
general	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
being	1
ruined	1
where	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
serf	1
labor	1
and	1
good	1
management	1
gave	1
a	1
yield	1
of	1
nine	1
to	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
half	1
crop	1
system	1
it	1
yields	1
three	1
to	1
one	1
russia	1
has	1
been	1
ruined	1
by	1
the	1
emancipation	1
sviazhsky	1
looked	1
with	1
smiling	1
eyes	1
at	1
levin	1
and	1
even	1
made	1
a	1
faint	1
gesture	1
of	1
irony	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
landowner	1
s	1
words	1
absurd	1
he	1
understood	1
them	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
sviazhsky	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
said	1
to	1
show	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
russia	1
was	1
ruined	1
by	1
the	1
emancipation	1
struck	1
him	1
indeed	1
as	1
very	1
true	1
new	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
quite	1
incontestable	1
the	1
landowner	1
unmistakably	1
spoke	1
his	1
own	1
individual	1
thought	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
very	1
rarely	1
happens	1
and	1
a	1
thought	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
desire	1
of	1
finding	1
some	1
exercise	1
for	1
an	1
idle	1
brain	1
but	1
a	1
thought	1
which	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
brooded	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
his	1
village	1
and	1
had	1
considered	1
in	1
every	1
aspect	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
progress	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
is	1
only	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
authority	1
he	1
said	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
he	1
was	1
not	1

the	1
reforms	1
of	1
peter	1
of	1

and	1

in	1

more	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
the	1
potato	1
for	1
instance	1
that	1
was	1
introduced	1
among	1
us	1
by	1
force	1
the	1
wooden	1
plough	1
too	1
wasn	1
t	1
always	1
used	1
it	1
was	1
introduced	1
maybe	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
empire	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
probably	1
brought	1
in	1
by	1
force	1
now	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
day	1
we	1
landowners	1
in	1
the	1
serf	1
times	1
used	1
various	1
improvements	1
in	1
our	1
husbandry	1
drying	1
machines	1
and	1
thrashing	1
machines	1
and	1
carting	1
manure	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
modern	1
implements	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
brought	1
into	1
use	1
by	1
our	1
authority	1
and	1
the	1
peasants	1
opposed	1
it	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
ended	1
by	1
imitating	1
us	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
abolition	1
of	1
serfdom	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
deprived	1
of	1
our	1
authority	1
and	1
so	1
our	1
husbandry	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
raised	1
to	1
a	1
high	1
level	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
sink	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
savage	1
primitive	1
condition	1
that	1

how	1
i	1

why	1
so	1
if	1

to	1
keep	1
up	1

get	1

when	1

he	1
ruins	1
everything	1

with	1

he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
unfold	1
his	1
own	1
scheme	1
of	1

by	1

of	1
which	1
these	1

this	1
did	1

when	1
he	1

finished	1
levin	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
first	1
position	1
and	1
addressing	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
into	1
expressing	1
his	1
serious	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
culture	1
is	1
falling	1
and	1
that	1
with	1
our	1
present	1
relations	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
farming	1
on	1
a	1
rational	1
system	1
to	1
yield	1
a	1
profit	1
that	1
s	1
perfectly	1
true	1
said	1
he	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
sviazhsky	1
replied	1
quite	1
seriously	1
all	1
i	1
see	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
cultivate	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
that	1
our	1
system	1
of	1
agriculture	1
in	1
the	1
serf	1
days	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
too	1
high	1

too	1
low	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
machines	1
no	1

we	1

he	1

you	1

if	1

everything	1

so	1

levin	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
eyes	1
he	1
detected	1
that	1
fleeting	1
expression	1
of	1
alarm	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
whenever	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
penetrate	1
beyond	1

of	1
sviazhsky	1

this	1
question	1
on	1

s	1
part	1

not	1
quite	1
in	1
good	1
faith	1
madame	1
sviazhskaya	1
had	1
just	1
told	1
him	1
at	1
tea	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
that	1
summer	1
invited	1
a	1
german	1
expert	1
in	1
bookkeeping	1
from	1
moscow	1
who	1
for	1
a	1
consideration	1
of	1
five	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
had	1
investigated	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
their	1
property	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
costing	1
them	1
a	1
loss	1
of	1
three	1
thousand	1
odd	1
roubles	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
precise	1
sum	1
but	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
the	1
german	1
had	1
worked	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
fraction	1
of	1
a	1
farthing	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskered	1
landowner	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
famling	1
obviously	1
aware	1
how	1
much	1

his	1

was	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
possibly	1
it	1

not	1

answered	1
sviazhsky	1
that	1
merely	1
proves	1
either	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
bad	1
manager	1
or	1
that	1
i	1
ve	1
sunk	1
my	1

for	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
my	1

oh	1

levin	1
cried	1
with	1
horror	1
rent	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
europe	1
where	1
land	1
has	1
been	1
improved	1
by	1
the	1
labor	1
put	1
into	1
it	1
but	1
with	1
us	1
all	1
the	1

is	1
deteriorating	1
from	1
the	1

into	1

in	1
the	1

frame	1
of	1
mind	1
sviazhsky	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
off	1
apparently	1
supposing	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
have	1
ended	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
when	1
to	1
levin	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
beginning	1
having	1
lost	1
his	1
antagonist	1
levin	1
continued	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskered	1
landowner	1
trying	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
and	1
habits	1
of	1
our	1
laborer	1
but	1
the	1
landowner	1
like	1
all	1
men	1
who	1
think	1
independently	1
and	1
in	1
isolation	1
was	1
slow	1
in	1
taking	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
s	1
idea	1
and	1
particularly	1
partial	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
stuck	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
peasant	1
is	1
a	1
swine	1
and	1
likes	1
swinishness	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
swinishness	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
authority	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
stick	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
become	1
so	1
liberal	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
replaced	1
the	1
stick	1
that	1
served	1
us	1
for	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
by	1
lawyers	1
and	1
model	1
prisons	1
where	1
the	1
worthless	1
stinking	1
peasant	1
is	1
fed	1
on	1
good	1
soup	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
fixed	1
allowance	1
of	1
cubic	1
feet	1
of	1
air	1
what	1
makes	1
you	1
think	1
said	1
levin	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
laborer	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
labor	1
would	1
become	1
productive	1
that	1
never	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
russian	1
peasantry	1
we	1
ve	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
answered	1
the	1
landowner	1
how	1
can	1
new	1
conditions	1
be	1
found	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
having	1
eaten	1
some	1
junket	1
and	1
lighted	1
a	1
cigarette	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
discussion	1
all	1
possible	1
relations	1
to	1
the	1
labor	1
force	1
have	1
been	1
defined	1
and	1
studied	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
relic	1
of	1
barbarism	1
the	1
primitive	1
commune	1
with	1
each	1
guarantee	1
for	1
all	1
will	1
disappear	1
of	1
itself	1
serfdom	1
has	1
been	1
abolished	1
there	1
remains	1
nothing	1
but	1
free	1
labor	1
and	1
its	1
forms	1
are	1
fixed	1
and	1
ready	1
made	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
adopted	1
permanent	1
hands	1
day	1
laborers	1
rammers	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
forms	1
but	1
europe	1
is	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
these	1
forms	1
dissatisfied	1
and	1
seeking	1
new	1
ones	1
and	1
will	1
find	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
i	1
was	1
meaning	1
answered	1
levin	1
why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
we	1
seek	1
them	1
for	1
ourselves	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
just	1
like	1
inventing	1
afresh	1
the	1
means	1
for	1
constructing	1
railways	1
they	1
are	1
ready	1
invented	1

if	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
if	1
they	1
re	1
stupid	1
said	1
levin	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
detected	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
alarm	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
sviazhsky	1
oh	1
yes	1
we	1
ll	1
bury	1
the	1
world	1
under	1
our	1
caps	1
we	1
ve	1
found	1
the	1
secret	1
europe	1

seeking	1
for	1
i	1
ve	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
but	1
excuse	1
me	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
s	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
europe	1
on	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
labor	1
no	1
very	1
little	1
that	1
question	1
is	1
now	1
absorbing	1
the	1
best	1
minds	1
in	1
europe	1
the	1
schulze	1
delitsch	1
movement	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
this	1
enormous	1

most	1
liberal	1
lassalle	1

the	1

that	1
s	1
a	1
fact	1
by	1
now	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
probably	1
aware	1
i	1
have	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
very	1
vague	1
no	1
you	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
no	1
doubt	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
a	1
professor	1
of	1
sociology	1
of	1

it	1
interested	1
me	1
and	1
really	1
if	1
it	1
interests	1
you	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
study	1
it	1

what	1
conclusion	1
have	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
excuse	1
me	1
the	1
two	1
neighbors	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
sviazhsky	1
once	1
more	1
checking	1
levin	1
in	1
his	1
inconvenient	1
habit	1
of	1
peeping	1
into	1
what	1
was	1
beyond	1
the	1
outer	1
chambers	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
guests	1
out	1
chapter	1
28	1
levin	1
was	1
insufferably	1
bored	1
that	1
evening	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
he	1
was	1
stirred	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
before	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
dissatisfaction	1
he	1
was	1
feeling	1
with	1
his	1
system	1
of	1
managing	1
his	1
land	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
exceptional	1
case	1
but	1
the	1
general	1
condition	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
russia	1
that	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
some	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
laborers	1
to	1
the	1
soil	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
work	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
peasant	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
half	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
sviazhskys	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
dream	1
but	1
a	1
problem	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
solved	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
problem	1
could	1
be	1
solved	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
solve	1
it	1
after	1
saying	1
good	1
night	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
promising	1
to	1
stay	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
expedition	1
on	1
horseback	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
see	1
an	1
interesting	1
ruin	1
in	1
the	1
crown	1
forest	1
levin	1
went	1
before	1
going	1
to	1
bed	1
into	1
his	1
host	1
s	1
study	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
books	1
on	1
the	1
labor	1
question	1
that	1
sviazhsky	1
had	1
offered	1
him	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
study	1
was	1
a	1
huge	1
room	1
surrounded	1
by	1
bookcases	1
and	1
with	1
two	1
tables	1
in	1
it	1
one	1
a	1
massive	1
writing	1
table	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
round	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
recent	1
numbers	1
of	1
reviews	1
and	1
journals	1
in	1
different	1
languages	1
ranged	1
like	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
a	1
star	1
round	1
the	1
lamp	1
on	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
was	1
a	1
stand	1
of	1
drawers	1
marked	1
with	1
gold	1
lettering	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
papers	1
of	1
various	1
sorts	1
sviazhsky	1
took	1
out	1
the	1
books	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
rocking	1
chair	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
looking	1
at	1
there	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
levin	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
round	1
table	1
looking	1
through	1
the	1
reviews	1
oh	1
yes	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
article	1
here	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
of	1
the	1
review	1
levin	1
was	1
holding	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
it	1
appears	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
eager	1
interest	1
that	1
friedrich	1
was	1
not	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
person	1
chiefly	1
responsible	1
for	1
the	1
partition	1
of	1
poland	1
it	1
is	1
proved	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
characteristic	1
clearness	1
he	1
summed	1
up	1
those	1
new	1
very	1
important	1
and	1
interesting	1
revelations	1
although	1
levin	1
was	1
engrossed	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
by	1
his	1
ideas	1
about	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
he	1
wondered	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
sviazhsky	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
inside	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
why	1
why	1
is	1
he	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
partition	1
of	1
poland	1
when	1
sviazhsky	1
had	1
finished	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
asking	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
then	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
follow	1
it	1
was	1
simply	1
interesting	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
so	1
but	1
sviazhsky	1
did	1
not	1
explain	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
explain	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
interesting	1
to	1
him	1
yes	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
interested	1
by	1
your	1
irritable	1
neighbor	1
said	1
levin	1
sighing	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
clever	1
fellow	1
and	1
said	1
a	1
lot	1
that	1
was	1
true	1
oh	1
get	1
along	1
with	1
you	1
an	1
inveterate	1
supporter	1
of	1
serfdom	1
at	1
heart	1
like	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
whose	1
marshal	1
you	1
are	1
yes	1
only	1
i	1
marshal	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
direction	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
laughing	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
interests	1
me	1
very	1
much	1
said	1
levin	1
he	1
s	1
right	1
that	1
our	1
system	1
that	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
rational	1
farming	1
doesn	1
t	1
answer	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
answers	1
is	1
the	1
money	1
lender	1
system	1
like	1
that	1
meek	1
looking	1
gentleman	1
s	1
or	1
else	1
the	1
very	1
simplest	1
whose	1
fault	1
is	1
it	1
our	1
own	1
of	1
course	1
besides	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
true	1
that	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
answer	1
it	1
answers	1
with	1
vassiltchikov	1
a	1
factory	1
but	1
i	1
really	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
are	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
people	1

at	1
such	1
a	1
low	1
stage	1
of	1
rational	1
and	1
moral	1
development	1
that	1

because	1
the	1

that	1

met	1
a	1
peasant	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
baby	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
she	1

she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
wise	1
woman	1
her	1
boy	1
had	1
screaming	1
fits	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
taking	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
doctored	1
i	1
asked	1
why	1
how	1
does	1
the	1
wise	1
woman	1
cure	1
screaming	1
fits	1
she	1
puts	1
the	1
child	1
on	1
the	1

and	1
repeats	1
some	1
charm	1
well	1
you	1

it	1
yourself	1
what	1
s	1
wanted	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
taking	1
her	1
child	1
to	1
the	1
hen	1

to	1
cure	1
it	1
of	1
screaming	1

is	1
just	1
sviazhsky	1
said	1
smiling	1
good	1
humoredly	1
oh	1
no	1
said	1
levin	1
with	1
annoyance	1
that	1
method	1
of	1
doctoring	1
i	1
merely	1
meant	1
as	1
a	1
simile	1
for	1
doctoring	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
schools	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
poor	1
and	1
ignorant	1
that	1
we	1
see	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
the	1
peasant	1
woman	1
sees	1
the	1
baby	1
is	1
ill	1
because	1
it	1
screams	1
but	1
in	1
what	1

this	1
trouble	1
of	1
poverty	1
and	1
ignorance	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
cured	1
by	1
schools	1
is	1
as	1
incomprehensible	1
as	1
how	1
the	1
hen	1
roost	1
affects	1
the	1
screaming	1
what	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
cured	1
is	1
what	1
makes	1
him	1
poor	1
well	1
in	1
that	1
at	1

you	1
re	1
in	1
agreement	1
with	1
spencer	1
whom	1
you	1
dislike	1
so	1
much	1
he	1
says	1
too	1
that	1
education	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
greater	1
prosperity	1
and	1
comfort	1
of	1
more	1
frequent	1
washing	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
but	1
not	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
well	1
then	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
or	1
the	1
contrary	1
very	1
sorry	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
in	1

only	1
i	1
ve	1
known	1
it	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
schools	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
good	1
what	1
will	1
do	1
good	1
is	1
an	1
economic	1
organization	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
become	1
richer	1
will	1
have	1
more	1

there	1
will	1
be	1
schools	1
still	1
all	1
over	1
europe	1
now	1

are	1
obligatory	1

how	1
far	1
do	1
you	1
agree	1
with	1

yourself	1
about	1
it	1
asked	1
levin	1

there	1
was	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
alarm	1
in	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
no	1
that	1

is	1
positively	1
capital	1
did	1
you	1
really	1
hear	1
it	1
yourself	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
connection	1
between	1
this	1
man	1
s	1
life	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
obviously	1
he	1
did	1

in	1
the	1
least	1
what	1
his	1
reasoning	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
was	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
reasoning	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
reasoning	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
blind	1
alley	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
he	1
disliked	1
and	1
avoided	1
by	1
changing	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
something	1
agreeable	1
and	1
amusing	1
all	1
the	1

sviazhsky	1
keeping	1
a	1
stock	1
of	1
ideas	1
simply	1
for	1

purposes	1
and	1
obviously	1
having	1
some	1
other	1
principles	1
hidden	1
from	1
levin	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
crowd	1
whose	1
name	1

he	1
guided	1
public	1

by	1

not	1

in	1
the	1
conclusions	1
that	1
he	1
had	1

wrong	1
in	1
his	1
exasperation	1

and	1
the	1
vague	1
hope	1
of	1
finding	1
a	1
remedy	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
all	1
was	1
blended	1
in	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
inward	1
turmoil	1
and	1
anticipation	1
of	1
some	1
solution	1
near	1
at	1
hand	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
assigned	1
him	1

on	1

yielded	1
unexpectedly	1
at	1

he	1

a	1

interested	1
levin	1

the	1

recalling	1

and	1
in	1
imagination	1
amending	1
his	1
own	1
replies	1
yes	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
our	1
husbandry	1
does	1
not	1
answer	1
because	1
the	1
peasant	1
hates	1
improvements	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
forced	1
on	1
him	1
by	1
authority	1
if	1
no	1
system	1
of	1
husbandry	1
answered	1
at	1
all	1
without	1
these	1
improvements	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
right	1
but	1
the	1
only	1
system	1
that	1
does	1
answer	1
is	1
where	1
laborer	1
is	1
working	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
habits	1
just	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
peasant	1
s	1
land	1
half	1
way	1
here	1
your	1
and	1
our	1
general	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
the	1
system	1
shows	1
that	1
either	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
blame	1
or	1
the	1
laborers	1
we	1
have	1
gone	1
our	1
way	1

long	1

without	1
asking	1
ourselves	1
about	1
the	1
qualities	1

our	1

let	1
us	1
try	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
labor	1

not	1
as	1
an	1
abstract	1
force	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
russian	1
peasant	1
with	1
his	1
instincts	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
arrange	1
our	1
system	1
of	1
culture	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
that	1
imagine	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
system	1
as	1
the	1

has	1
that	1
you	1
have	1

your	1

an	1

the	1
happy	1

in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1

which	1
they	1
will	1
admit	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
without	1
exhausting	1
the	1
soil	1
get	1
twice	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
the	1
yield	1
you	1
got	1
before	1
divide	1
it	1
in	1
halves	1
give	1
half	1
as	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
labor	1
the	1
surplus	1
left	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
greater	1
and	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
labor	1
will	1
be	1
greater	1
too	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
one	1
must	1
lower	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1

how	1
to	1

this	1

a	1
matter	1
of	1
detail	1

undoubtedly	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
this	1
idea	1
threw	1
levin	1
into	1
a	1
great	1
excitement	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
half	1
the	1
night	1
thinking	1
over	1
in	1
detail	1
the	1
putting	1
of	1
his	1

he	1
had	1
not	1

the	1
morning	1
besides	1
the	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
with	1
her	1
low	1

in	1
him	1
a	1

for	1
some	1
utterly	1
base	1
action	1
most	1

of	1
all	1

project	1
to	1
the	1

before	1

that	1

might	1
be	1

chapter	1
29	1
the	1
carrying	1
out	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
plan	1
presented	1
many	1
difficulties	1
but	1
he	1
struggled	1
on	1
doing	1
his	1
utmost	1
and	1
attained	1
a	1
result	1
which	1
though	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
desired	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
without	1
self	1
deception	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
attempt	1
was	1
worth	1
the	1
trouble	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
difficulties	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
cultivating	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
swing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
stop	1
everything	1
and	1
begin	1
it	1
all	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
machine	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
mended	1
while	1
in	1
motion	1
when	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
that	1
he	1
arrived	1
home	1
he	1
informed	1
the	1
bailiff	1
of	1
his	1
plans	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
visible	1
pleasure	1
agreed	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
pointing	1
out	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
stupid	1
and	1
useless	1
the	1
bailiff	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
so	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
ago	1
but	1
no	1
heed	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
him	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
proposal	1
made	1
by	1
levin	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
part	1
as	1
shareholder	1
with	1
his	1
laborers	1
in	1
each	1
agricultural	1
undertaking	1
at	1
this	1
the	1
bailiff	1
simply	1
expressed	1
a	1
profound	1
despondency	1
and	1
offered	1
no	1
definite	1
opinion	1
but	1
began	1
immediately	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
urgent	1
necessity	1
of	1
carrying	1
the	1
remaining	1
sheaves	1
of	1
rye	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
of	1
sending	1
the	1
men	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
ploughing	1
so	1
that	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
discussing	1
it	1
on	1
beginning	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
proposition	1
to	1
cede	1
them	1
the	1
land	1
on	1
new	1
terms	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
collision	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
great	1
difficulty	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
much	1
absorbed	1
by	1
the	1
current	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
scheme	1
the	1
simple	1
hearted	1
ivan	1
the	1
cowherd	1
seemed	1
completely	1
to	1
grasp	1
levin	1
s	1
proposal	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
take	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
the	1
cattle	1
yard	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
complete	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
plan	1
but	1
when	1
levin	1
hinted	1
at	1
the	1
future	1
advantages	1
ivan	1
s	1
face	1
expressed	1
alarm	1
and	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
find	1
himself	1
some	1
task	1
that	1
would	1
admit	1
of	1
no	1
delay	1
he	1
either	1
snatched	1
up	1
the	1
fork	1
to	1
pitch	1
the	1
hay	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pens	1
or	1
ran	1
to	1
get	1
water	1
or	1
to	1
clear	1
out	1
the	1
dung	1
another	1
difficulty	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
invincible	1
disbelief	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
that	1
a	1
landowner	1
s	1
object	1
could	1
be	1
anything	1
else	1
than	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
squeeze	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
his	1
real	1
aim	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
themselves	1
in	1
giving	1
their	1
opinion	1
said	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
but	1
never	1
said	1
what	1
was	1
their	1
real	1
object	1
moreover	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
irascible	1
landowner	1
had	1
been	1
right	1
the	1
peasants	1
made	1
their	1
first	1
and	1
unalterable	1
condition	1
of	1
any	1
agreement	1
whatever	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
any	1
new	1
methods	1
of	1
tillage	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
nor	1
to	1
use	1
new	1
implements	1
they	1
agreed	1
that	1
the	1
modern	1
plough	1
ploughed	1
better	1
that	1
the	1
scarifier	1
did	1
the	1
work	1
more	1
quickly	1
but	1
they	1
found	1
thousands	1
of	1
reasons	1
that	1
made	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
use	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
accepted	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
lower	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
cultivation	1
he	1
felt	1
sorry	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
improved	1
methods	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
obvious	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
difficulties	1
he	1
got	1
his	1
way	1
and	1
by	1
autumn	1
the	1
system	1
was	1
working	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
first	1
levin	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
giving	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
farming	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
the	1
laborers	1
and	1
the	1
bailiff	1
on	1
new	1
conditions	1
of	1
partnership	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
soon	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
divide	1
it	1
up	1
the	1
cattle	1
yard	1
the	1
garden	1
hay	1
fields	1
and	1
arable	1
land	1
divided	1
into	1
several	1
parts	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
into	1
separate	1
lots	1
the	1
simple	1
hearted	1
cowherd	1
ivan	1
who	1
levin	1
fancied	1
understood	1
the	1
matter	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
collecting	1
together	1
a	1
gang	1
of	1
workers	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
principally	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
family	1
became	1
a	1
partner	1
in	1
the	1
cattle	1
yard	1
a	1
distant	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
a	1
tract	1
of	1
waste	1
land	1
that	1
had	1
lain	1
fallow	1
for	1
eight	1
years	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
clever	1
carpenter	1
fyodor	1
ryezunov	1
taken	1
by	1
six	1
families	1
of	1
peasants	1
on	1
new	1
conditions	1
of	1
partnership	1
and	1
the	1
peasant	1
shuraev	1
took	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
vegetable	1
gardens	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
terms	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
still	1
worked	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
system	1
but	1
these	1
three	1
associated	1
partnerships	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
and	1
they	1
completely	1
took	1
up	1
levin	1
s	1
time	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
cattle	1
yard	1
things	1
went	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
before	1
and	1
ivan	1
strenuously	1
opposed	1
warm	1
housing	1
for	1
the	1
cows	1
and	1
butter	1
made	1
of	1
fresh	1
cream	1
affirming	1
that	1
cows	1
require	1
less	1
food	1
if	1
kept	1
cold	1
and	1
that	1
butter	1
is	1
more	1
profitable	1
made	1
from	1
sour	1
cream	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
wages	1
just	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
old	1
system	1
and	1
took	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
received	1
was	1
not	1
wages	1
but	1
an	1
advance	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
future	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
profits	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
fyodor	1
ryezunov	1
s	1
company	1
did	1
not	1
plough	1
over	1
the	1
ground	1
twice	1
before	1
sowing	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
agreed	1
justifying	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
plea	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
too	1
short	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
company	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
land	1
on	1
new	1
conditions	1
always	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
not	1
as	1
held	1
in	1
partnership	1
but	1
as	1
rented	1
for	1
half	1
the	1
crop	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
ryezunov	1
himself	1
said	1
to	1
levin	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
take	1
a	1
rent	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
it	1
would	1
save	1
you	1
trouble	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
more	1
free	1
moreover	1
the	1
same	1
peasants	1
kept	1
putting	1
off	1
on	1
various	1
excuses	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
a	1
cattleyard	1
and	1
barn	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
as	1
agreed	1
upon	1
and	1
delayed	1
doing	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
winter	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
shuraev	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
let	1
out	1
the	1
kitchen	1
gardens	1
he	1
had	1
undertaken	1
in	1
small	1
lots	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
he	1
evidently	1
quite	1
misunderstood	1
and	1
apparently	1
intentionally	1
misunderstood	1
the	1
conditions	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
often	1
too	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
explaining	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
heard	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
were	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
themselves	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
cleverest	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
ryezunov	1
and	1
detected	1
the	1
gleam	1
in	1
ryezunov	1
s	1
eyes	1
which	1
showed	1
so	1
plainly	1
both	1
ironical	1
amusement	1
at	1
levin	1
and	1
the	1
firm	1
conviction	1
that	1
if	1
anyone	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
he	1
ryezunov	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
levin	1
thought	1
the	1
system	1
worked	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
keeping	1
accounts	1
strictly	1
and	1
insisting	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
he	1
would	1
prove	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
arrangement	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
system	1
would	1
go	1
of	1
itself	1
these	1
matters	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
still	1
left	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
the	1
indoor	1
work	1
over	1
his	1
book	1
so	1
engrossed	1
levin	1
the	1
whole	1
summer	1
that	1
he	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
went	1
out	1
shooting	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
august	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
oblonskys	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
to	1
moscow	1
from	1
their	1
servant	1
who	1
brought	1
back	1
the	1
side	1
saddle	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
not	1
answering	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
by	1
his	1
rudeness	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
without	1
a	1
flush	1
of	1
shame	1
burned	1
his	1
ships	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
just	1
as	1
rude	1
with	1
the	1
sviazhskys	1
leaving	1
them	1
without	1
saying	1
good	1
bye	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
either	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
that	1
now	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
reorganizing	1
the	1
farming	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
absorbed	1
him	1
as	1
completely	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
books	1
lent	1
him	1
by	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
copying	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
he	1
read	1
both	1
the	1
economic	1
and	1
socialistic	1
books	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
anticipated	1
found	1
nothing	1
bearing	1
on	1
the	1
scheme	1
he	1
had	1
undertaken	1
in	1
the	1
books	1
on	1
political	1
economy	1
in	1
mill	1
for	1
instance	1
whom	1
he	1
studied	1
first	1
with	1
great	1
ardor	1
hoping	1
every	1
minute	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
were	1
engrossing	1
him	1
he	1
found	1
laws	1
deduced	1
from	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
land	1
culture	1
in	1
europe	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
why	1
these	1
laws	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
apply	1
in	1
russia	1
must	1
be	1
general	1
he	1
saw	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
socialistic	1
books	1
either	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
beautiful	1
but	1
impracticable	1
fantasies	1
which	1
had	1
fascinated	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
student	1
or	1
they	1
were	1
attempts	1
at	1
improving	1
rectifying	1
the	1
economic	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
europe	1
was	1
placed	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
land	1
tenure	1
in	1
russia	1
had	1
nothing	1
in	1
common	1
political	1
economy	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
europe	1
had	1
been	1
developed	1
and	1
was	1
developing	1
were	1
universal	1
and	1
unvarying	1
socialism	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
development	1
along	1
these	1
lines	1
leads	1
to	1
ruin	1
and	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
gave	1
an	1
answer	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
hint	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
what	1
he	1
levin	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
russian	1
peasants	1
and	1
landowners	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
their	1
millions	1
of	1
hands	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
acres	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
as	1
productive	1
as	1
possible	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
weal	1
having	1
once	1
taken	1
the	1
subject	1
up	1
he	1
read	1
conscientiously	1
everything	1
bearing	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
intended	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
to	1
study	1
land	1
systems	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
on	1
this	1
question	1
be	1
confronted	1
with	1
what	1
so	1
often	1
met	1
him	1
on	1
various	1
subjects	1
often	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
idea	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
anyone	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
would	1
suddenly	1
be	1
told	1
but	1
kauffmann	1
but	1
jones	1
but	1
dubois	1
but	1
michelli	1
you	1
haven	1
t	1
read	1
them	1
they	1
ve	1
thrashed	1
that	1
question	1
out	1
thoroughly	1
he	1
saw	1
now	1
distinctly	1
that	1
kauffmann	1
and	1
michelli	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
russia	1
has	1
splendid	1
land	1
splendid	1
laborers	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
certain	1
cases	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
peasant	1
s	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
the	1
produce	1
raised	1
by	1
the	1
laborers	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
cases	1
when	1
capital	1
is	1
applied	1
in	1
the	1
european	1
way	1
the	1
produce	1
is	1
small	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
simply	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
laborers	1
want	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
work	1
well	1
only	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
peculiar	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
antagonism	1
is	1
not	1
incidental	1
but	1
invariable	1
and	1
has	1
its	1
roots	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
spirit	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
people	1
whose	1
task	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
colonize	1
and	1
cultivate	1
vast	1
tracts	1
of	1
unoccupied	1
land	1
consciously	1
adhered	1
till	1
all	1
their	1
land	1
was	1
occupied	1
to	1
the	1
methods	1
suitable	1
to	1
their	1
purpose	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
methods	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
was	1
generally	1
supposed	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
prove	1
this	1
theoretically	1
in	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
practically	1
on	1
his	1
land	1
chapter	1
30	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
september	1
the	1
timber	1
had	1
been	1
carted	1
for	1
building	1
the	1
cattleyard	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
allotted	1
to	1
the	1
association	1
of	1
peasants	1
and	1
the	1
butter	1
from	1
the	1
cows	1
was	1
sold	1
and	1
the	1
profits	1
divided	1
in	1
practice	1
the	1
system	1
worked	1
capitally	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
work	1
out	1
the	1
whole	1
subject	1
theoretically	1
and	1
to	1
complete	1
his	1
book	1
which	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
daydreams	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
political	1
economy	1
but	1
to	1
annihilate	1
that	1
science	1
entirely	1
and	1
to	1
lay	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
the	1
soil	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
tour	1
abroad	1
and	1
to	1
study	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
and	1
to	1
collect	1
conclusive	1
evidence	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
was	1
wanted	1
levin	1
was	1
only	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
delivery	1
of	1
his	1
wheat	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
money	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
go	1
abroad	1
but	1
the	1
rains	1
began	1
preventing	1
the	1
harvesting	1
of	1
the	1
corn	1
and	1
potatoes	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
putting	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
all	1
work	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
delivery	1
of	1
the	1
wheat	1
the	1
mud	1
was	1
impassable	1
along	1
the	1
roads	1
two	1
mills	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
weather	1

sun	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
hoping	1
for	1
fine	1
weather	1
levin	1
began	1
making	1
final	1
preparations	1
for	1
his	1
journey	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
wheat	1
to	1

sent	1
the	1
bailiff	1
to	1
the	1
merchant	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
money	1
owing	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
himself	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
final	1
directions	1
on	1
the	1
estate	1
before	1
setting	1
off	1
having	1
finished	1
all	1
his	1
business	1
soaked	1
through	1
with	1
the	1
streams	1
of	1
water	1
which	1
kept	1
running	1
down	1
the	1
leather	1
behind	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
his	1
gaiters	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
keenest	1
and	1
most	1
confident	1
temper	1
levin	1
returned	1
homewards	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
weather	1
had	1
become	1
worse	1
than	1
ever	1
towards	1
evening	1
the	1
hail	1
lashed	1
the	1
drenched	1
mare	1
so	1
cruelly	1
that	1
she	1
went	1
along	1
sideways	1
shaking	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
ears	1
but	1
levin	1
was	1
all	1
right	1
under	1
his	1
hood	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
cheerfully	1
about	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
muddy	1
streams	1
running	1
under	1
the	1
wheels	1
at	1
the	1
drops	1
hanging	1
on	1
every	1
bare	1
twig	1
at	1
the	1
whiteness	1
of	1
the	1
patch	1
of	1
unmelted	1
hailstones	1
on	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
at	1
the	1
thick	1
layer	1
of	1
still	1
juicy	1
fleshy	1
leaves	1
that	1
lay	1
heaped	1
up	1
about	1
the	1
stripped	1
elm	1

in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
gloominess	1
of	1
nature	1
around	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
peculiarly	1
eager	1
the	1

had	1
been	1

was	1
refused	1
by	1
the	1

felt	1
just	1
as	1
worthless	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
had	1
no	1
faith	1
in	1

thinking	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1

come	1
back	1

brought	1

of	1
the	1

for	1
the	1

an	1
agreement	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
bailiff	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
everywhere	1
the	1
corn	1
was	1
still	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
shocks	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
carried	1
were	1
nothing	1
in	1

with	1
the	1
losses	1
of	1
others	1
after	1
dinner	1
levin	1
was	1
sitting	1
as	1
he	1
usually	1
did	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
his	1
book	1
today	1
all	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
book	1
rose	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
special	1
distinctness	1
and	1
whole	1
periods	1
ranged	1
themselves	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
in	1
illustration	1
of	1

theories	1
i	1
must	1
write	1
that	1
down	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
brief	1
introduction	1
which	1
i	1
thought	1
unnecessary	1
before	1

got	1
up	1
to	1

at	1

up	1

stretching	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
inquire	1
where	1
to	1
go	1

he	1
had	1
not	1

to	1
write	1
it	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
head	1
peasants	1
had	1
come	1
round	1
and	1
levin	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
them	1
after	1
his	1
levee	1
that	1
is	1
to	1

giving	1
directions	1
about	1
the	1

all	1
the	1

who	1
had	1
business	1
with	1
him	1
levin	1
went	1
back	1
to	1

down	1
to	1
work	1

under	1

mihalovna	1
settled	1
herself	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
with	1
her	1
stocking	1
after	1
writing	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
levin	1
suddenly	1
thought	1
with	1
exceptional	1
vividness	1
of	1
kitty	1
her	1
refusal	1
and	1
their	1
last	1
meeting	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
use	1
of	1

knew	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
plans	1
for	1
his	1
land	1
levin	1
often	1
put	1
his	1
views	1
before	1
her	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
complexity	1
and	1
not	1
uncommonly	1
he	1
argued	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
her	1
comments	1
but	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
she	1
entirely	1
misinterpreted	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
one	1
s	1
soul	1
s	1
salvation	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
and	1
must	1
think	1
before	1

with	1
a	1
sigh	1

now	1
for	1
all	1

no	1

to	1
a	1

who	1
had	1
died	1
recently	1
took	1
the	1
sacrament	1
and	1
all	1
that	1

all	1
i	1

is	1
answered	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
evidently	1
not	1
speaking	1
at	1
random	1
but	1
in	1
strict	1
sequence	1
of	1
idea	1
that	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
get	1
married	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
i	1
say	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
s	1

to	1
the	1
very	1
subject	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
hurt	1
and	1
stung	1
him	1
levin	1
scowled	1
and	1
without	1
answering	1
her	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
work	1
repeating	1
to	1
himself	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
significance	1
of	1
that	1
work	1
only	1
at	1
intervals	1
he	1
listened	1
in	1
the	1
stillness	1
to	1
the	1
click	1
of	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
s	1
needles	1
and	1
recollecting	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
remember	1
he	1
frowned	1
again	1
at	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
the	1
faint	1
vibration	1
of	1

carriage	1
over	1

agafea	1
mihalovna	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
levin	1
overtook	1
her	1
his	1
work	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
well	1
now	1

he	1
was	1

of	1

might	1
be	1
chapter	1
31	1
running	1
halfway	1
down	1
the	1
staircase	1
levin	1
caught	1
a	1
sound	1
he	1
knew	1
a	1
familiar	1
cough	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
but	1
he	1
heard	1
it	1
indistinctly	1
through	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
footsteps	1
and	1
hoped	1
he	1
was	1
mistaken	1
then	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
bony	1
familiar	1
figure	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
seemed	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
mistake	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
still	1
went	1
on	1
hoping	1
that	1
this	1
tall	1
man	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
fur	1
cloak	1
and	1
coughing	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
loved	1
his	1
brother	1
but	1
being	1
with	1
him	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
torture	1
just	1
now	1
when	1
levin	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
s	1
hint	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
troubled	1
and	1
uncertain	1
humor	1
the	1
meeting	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
face	1
seemed	1
particularly	1
difficult	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
lively	1
healthy	1
visitor	1
some	1
outsider	1
who	1
would	1
he	1
hoped	1
cheer	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
uncertain	1
humor	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
who	1
would	1
call	1
forth	1
all	1
the	1
thoughts	1
nearest	1
his	1
heart	1
would	1
force	1
him	1
to	1
show	1
himself	1
fully	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
do	1
angry	1
with	1
himself	1
for	1
so	1
base	1
a	1
feeling	1
levin	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
brother	1
close	1
this	1
feeling	1
of	1
selfish	1
disappointment	1
vanished	1
instantly	1
and	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
pity	1
terrible	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
in	1
his	1
emaciation	1
and	1
sickliness	1
now	1
he	1
looked	1
still	1
more	1
emaciated	1
still	1
more	1
wasted	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
skeleton	1
covered	1
with	1
skin	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
jerking	1
his	1
long	1
thin	1
neck	1
and	1
pulling	1
the	1
scarf	1
off	1
it	1
and	1
smiled	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
pitiful	1
smile	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
smile	1
submissive	1
and	1
humble	1
levin	1
felt	1
something	1
clutching	1
at	1
his	1
throat	1
you	1
see	1
i	1
ve	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
nikolay	1
in	1
a	1
thick	1
voice	1
never	1
for	1
one	1
second	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
face	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
but	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
unwell	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
now	1
i	1
m	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
better	1
he	1
said	1
rubbing	1
his	1
beard	1
with	1
his	1
big	1
thin	1
hands	1
yes	1
yes	1
answered	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
still	1
more	1
frightened	1
when	1
kissing	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
dryness	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
skin	1
and	1
saw	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
big	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
light	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
before	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1

what	1
was	1
more	1
important	1
to	1
stay	1
a	1
while	1
in	1
the	1

nest	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
earth	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
renew	1
his	1
strength	1
like	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
old	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
exaggerated	1
stoop	1
and	1
the	1
emaciation	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
striking	1
from	1
his	1
height	1
his	1
movements	1
were	1
as	1
rapid	1
and	1
abrupt	1
as	1
ever	1
levin	1

him	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
his	1
brother	1
dressed	1
with	1
particular	1

a	1
thing	1
he	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
do	1
combed	1
his	1
scanty	1
lank	1
hair	1
and	1
smiling	1
went	1
upstairs	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
affectionate	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
mood	1
just	1
as	1
levin	1
often	1
remembered	1
him	1
in	1
childhood	1
he	1
even	1
referred	1
to	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
without	1
rancor	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
he	1
made	1
jokes	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
asked	1
after	1
the	1
old	1
servants	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
parfen	1
denisitch	1

a	1
painful	1
impression	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
fear	1
crossed	1
his	1
face	1
but	1
he	1
regained	1
his	1
serenity	1
immediately	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
old	1
he	1
said	1

changed	1

of	1
that	1
woman	1
marya	1

why	1
what	1
for	1
oh	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
horrid	1
woman	1
she	1
caused	1
me	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
worries	1

he	1
did	1
not	1

what	1
the	1

were	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
off	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
because	1
the	1
tea	1
was	1
weak	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
because	1
she	1
would	1
look	1
after	1
him	1

quite	1
restored	1
levin	1
listened	1
and	1
racked	1
his	1
brains	1
but	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
nikolay	1
probably	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
began	1
questioning	1
his	1
brother	1
about	1
his	1
affairs	1
and	1
levin	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
himself	1
because	1
then	1
he	1
could	1
speak	1
without	1
hypocrisy	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
his	1
plans	1
and	1
his	1
doings	1
his	1
brother	1
listened	1
but	1
evidently	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
by	1
it	1
these	1
two	1
men	1
were	1
so	1
akin	1
so	1
near	1
each	1
other	1
that	1
the	1
slightest	1
gesture	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
told	1
both	1
more	1
than	1
could	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
words	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
now	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
thought	1
the	1
illness	1
of	1
nikolay	1
and	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
which	1
stifled	1
all	1
else	1
but	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
dared	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
so	1
whatever	1
they	1
said	1
not	1
uttering	1
the	1
one	1
thought	1
that	1
filled	1
their	1
minds	1
was	1
all	1
falsehood	1
never	1
had	1
levin	1
been	1
so	1
glad	1
when	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
never	1
with	1
any	1
outside	1
person	1
never	1
on	1
any	1
official	1
visit	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
so	1
unnatural	1
and	1
false	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
this	1
unnaturalness	1
and	1
the	1
remorse	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
even	1
more	1
unnatural	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
weep	1
over	1
his	1
dying	1
dearly	1
loved	1
brother	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
keep	1
on	1
talking	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
live	1
as	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
damp	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
bedroom	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
heated	1
levin	1
put	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
bedroom	1
behind	1
a	1
screen	1
his	1
brother	1
got	1
into	1
bed	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
slept	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
tossed	1
about	1
like	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
coughed	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
his	1
throat	1
clear	1
mumbled	1
something	1
sometimes	1
when	1
his	1
breathing	1
was	1
painful	1
he	1
said	1
oh	1
my	1
god	1
sometimes	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
choking	1
he	1
muttered	1
angrily	1
ah	1
the	1
devil	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
hearing	1
him	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
various	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
thoughts	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
death	1
death	1
the	1
inevitable	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
irresistible	1
force	1
and	1
death	1
which	1
was	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
loved	1
brother	1
groaning	1
half	1
asleep	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
calling	1
without	1
distinction	1
on	1
god	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
remote	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
hitherto	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
himself	1
too	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
if	1
not	1
today	1
tomorrow	1
if	1
not	1
tomorrow	1
in	1
thirty	1
years	1
wasn	1
t	1
it	1
all	1
the	1

and	1
what	1
was	1
this	1
inevitable	1
death	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1

never	1

about	1

what	1

more	1

he	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
crouched	1
up	1
hugging	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
holding	1
his	1
breath	1
from	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
thought	1
he	1
pondered	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
intensely	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
clearer	1
it	1
became	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
indubitably	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
reality	1
looking	1
upon	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
one	1
little	1
fact	1
that	1
death	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
all	1
ends	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
even	1
worth	1
beginning	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
helping	1
it	1
anyway	1
yes	1
it	1
was	1
awful	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
but	1
i	1

still	1
now	1
what	1

to	1

what	1

he	1
said	1
in	1
despair	1
he	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle	1
got	1
up	1
cautiously	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
hair	1
yes	1
there	1
were	1
gray	1
hairs	1
about	1
his	1
temples	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
his	1
back	1
teeth	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
decay	1
he	1
bared	1
his	1
muscular	1
arms	1
yes	1
there	1
was	1
strength	1
in	1
them	1
but	1
nikolay	1
who	1
lay	1
there	1

with	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
lungs	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
strong	1
healthy	1
body	1
too	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
recalled	1
how	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
together	1
as	1
children	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
only	1
waited	1
till	1
fyodor	1
bogdanitch	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
fling	1
pillows	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
laugh	1
laugh	1
irrepressibly	1
so	1
that	1
even	1
their	1
awe	1
of	1
fyodor	1
bogdanitch	1
could	1
not	1
check	1
the	1
effervescing	1
overbrimming	1
sense	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
happiness	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
bent	1
hollow	1

out	1
the	1
candle	1

for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1

the	1
question	1
how	1
to	1

had	1
hardly	1
begun	1
to	1
grow	1
a	1

clearer	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
a	1

itself	1
death	1

chapter	1
32	1
levin	1
had	1
long	1
before	1
made	1
the	1
observation	1
that	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
uncomfortable	1
with	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
being	1
excessively	1
amenable	1
and	1
meek	1
one	1
is	1
apt	1
very	1
soon	1
after	1
to	1
find	1
things	1
intolerable	1
from	1
their	1
touchiness	1
and	1
irritability	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1

in	1
fact	1
not	1
last	1
out	1
for	1
long	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
morning	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
irritable	1
and	1
seemed	1
doing	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
attacking	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
tenderest	1
points	1
levin	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
set	1
things	1
right	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
not	1
kept	1
up	1
appearances	1
but	1
had	1
spoken	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
had	1
said	1
only	1
just	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
they	1
would	1
simply	1
have	1
looked	1
into	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
faces	1
and	1
konstantin	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
said	1
you	1
re	1
dying	1
you	1
re	1
dying	1
and	1
nikolay	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
answered	1
i	1

i	1
m	1
dying	1

i	1
m	1
afraid	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
i	1

they	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
nothing	1
more	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
said	1
only	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
but	1
life	1
like	1
that	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
so	1
konstantin	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
never	1
could	1
learn	1
to	1
do	1
though	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
observe	1
many	1
people	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
and	1
without	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
living	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
continually	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
ring	1
of	1
falsehood	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
detected	1
him	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
exasperated	1
at	1
it	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
nikolay	1
induced	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
plan	1
to	1
him	1
again	1
and	1
began	1
not	1
merely	1
attacking	1
it	1
but	1
intentionally	1
confounding	1
it	1
with	1
communism	1
you	1
ve	1
simply	1
borrowed	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
your	1
own	1
but	1
you	1
ve	1
distorted	1
it	1
and	1
are	1
trying	1
to	1
apply	1
it	1
where	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
applicable	1
but	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
they	1
deny	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1

capital	1
of	1

while	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
deny	1
this	1
chief	1
stimulus	1
levin	1
felt	1
disgusted	1
himself	1
at	1
using	1
such	1
expressions	1
but	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
engrossed	1
by	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
come	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
to	1
use	1
words	1
not	1
russian	1
all	1
i	1
want	1
is	1
to	1
regulate	1
labor	1
which	1
means	1
you	1
ve	1
borrowed	1
an	1
idea	1
stripped	1
it	1
of	1
all	1
that	1

nothing	1
he	1
said	1
declaring	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
to	1

and	1
konstantin	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
simply	1
was	1
that	1

was	1
unbearable	1
to	1
him	1
nikolay	1
was	1
just	1
getting	1

to	1
go	1
when	1
konstantin	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
him	1
again	1

begged	1
him	1
rather	1
unnaturally	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
hurt	1
his	1

in	1
any	1

right	1
i	1

give	1
you	1
that	1
satisfaction	1

only	1
just	1
at	1

seriousness	1
at	1
his	1

it	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1

every	1

so	1
that	1

away	1
from	1

her	1

was	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
the	1

one	1
of	1
misery	1
for	1

not	1

this	1
position	1
for	1
a	1

day	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
expectation	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
change	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
temporary	1
painful	1
ordeal	1
which	1
would	1
pass	1
over	1

and	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
more	1

than	1
for	1
anyone	1
endured	1
it	1
because	1

not	1

hoped	1

firmly	1
believed	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
very	1
soon	1
be	1

had	1
not	1
the	1

idea	1
what	1
would	1
settle	1
the	1
position	1

she	1
firmly	1
believed	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
very	1
soon	1
turn	1
up	1
now	1
vronsky	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
or	1
wishes	1
followed	1
her	1

hoped	1
too	1
that	1
something	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1

be	1
sure	1
to	1
solve	1

very	1
tiresome	1
week	1
a	1
foreign	1
prince	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
petersburg	1

put	1
under	1
his	1
charge	1

he	1

to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
sights	1
worth	1
seeing	1
vronsky	1
was	1
of	1
distinguished	1
appearance	1
he	1
possessed	1
moreover	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
behaving	1
with	1
respectful	1
dignity	1
and	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
having	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
such	1
grand	1
personages	1
that	1
was	1
how	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
duties	1
very	1
irksome	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
miss	1
nothing	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
asked	1
at	1
home	1
had	1
he	1
seen	1
that	1
in	1

on	1
his	1
own	1

was	1
anxious	1
to	1
enjoy	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
all	1
russian	1
forms	1
of	1
amusement	1
vronsky	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
guide	1
in	1
satisfying	1
both	1
these	1
inclinations	1
the	1
mornings	1
they	1
spent	1
driving	1
to	1

in	1

exceptional	1
even	1
among	1
princes	1
by	1
gymnastics	1
and	1
careful	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
health	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
himself	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
excess	1
in	1
pleasure	1
he	1
looked	1
as	1
fresh	1
as	1
a	1
big	1
glossy	1
green	1
dutch	1
cucumber	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
traveled	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
and	1
considered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
advantages	1
of	1
modern	1
facilities	1
of	1
communication	1
was	1
the	1
accessibility	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
all	1

had	1
been	1
in	1
spain	1

there	1

indulged	1
in	1

had	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
a	1
spanish	1

played	1

mandolin	1
in	1

had	1
galloped	1
in	1
a	1
red	1

over	1

and	1
killed	1
two	1
hundred	1
pheasants	1
for	1
a	1
bet	1
in	1
turkey	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
harem	1
in	1
india	1
he	1
had	1
hunted	1
on	1
an	1
elephant	1
and	1
now	1
in	1
russia	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
taste	1
all	1
the	1
specially	1
russian	1
forms	1
of	1
pleasure	1
vronsky	1
who	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
chief	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
ceremonies	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
at	1
great	1
pains	1
to	1
arrange	1
all	1
the	1
russian	1
amusements	1
suggested	1
by	1
various	1
persons	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
they	1
had	1
race	1
horses	1

russian	1
pancakes	1

three	1

drinking	1
feasts	1
with	1
the	1
russian	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
broken	1
crockery	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
surprising	1
ease	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
russian	1
spirit	1
smashed	1
trays	1
full	1
of	1
crockery	1
sat	1
with	1
a	1
gypsy	1
girl	1
on	1
his	1
knee	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
asking	1
what	1
more	1
and	1
does	1
the	1
whole	1
russian	1
spirit	1
consist	1
in	1
just	1
this	1
in	1
reality	1
of	1
all	1
the	1

vronsky	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
princes	1
but	1
either	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
changed	1
of	1
late	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
too	1
close	1
proximity	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
week	1
seemed	1
fearfully	1
wearisome	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
week	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
sensation	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
set	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
a	1
dangerous	1
madman	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
madman	1
and	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
from	1
being	1
with	1
him	1
fearing	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
reason	1
vronsky	1
was	1
continually	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
never	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
relaxing	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
stern	1
official	1
respectfulness	1
that	1

might	1
not	1
himself	1

insulted	1

treating	1
the	1
very	1
people	1

to	1
vronsky	1
s	1
surprise	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
descend	1
to	1
any	1
depths	1
to	1
provide	1
him	1
with	1
russian	1
amusements	1
was	1
contemptuous	1
his	1
criticisms	1
of	1
russian	1
women	1
whom	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
study	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
made	1
vronsky	1
crimson	1
with	1
indignation	1
the	1
chief	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
so	1
particularly	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
vronsky	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
himself	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
this	1

and	1
will	1
be	1
there	1
till	1

thinking	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
of	1
the	1
strangeness	1
of	1
her	1
bidding	1
him	1
come	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
insisting	1
on	1
her	1
not	1
receiving	1
him	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
vronsky	1
had	1
that	1
winter	1
got	1
his	1
promotion	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
colonel	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
regimental	1
quarters	1
and	1
was	1
living	1
alone	1
after	1
having	1
some	1
lunch	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
immediately	1
and	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
hideous	1
scenes	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
were	1
confused	1
together	1
and	1
joined	1
on	1
to	1
a	1
mental	1
image	1
of	1
anna	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
who	1
had	1
played	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
bear	1
hunt	1
and	1
vronsky	1
fell	1
asleep	1
he	1
waked	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
trembling	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
light	1
a	1
candle	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
what	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
dreadful	1
thing	1
i	1
dreamed	1
yes	1
yes	1
i	1
think	1
a	1
little	1
dirty	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
disheveled	1
beard	1
was	1
stooping	1
down	1
doing	1
something	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
he	1
began	1
saying	1
some	1
strange	1
words	1
in	1
french	1
yes	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
dream	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
but	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
so	1
awful	1
he	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
the	1
peasant	1
again	1
and	1
those	1
incomprehensible	1
french	1
words	1
the	1
peasant	1
had	1
uttered	1
and	1
a	1
chill	1
of	1
horror	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
spine	1
what	1
nonsense	1
thought	1
vronsky	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
it	1
was	1
half	1
past	1
eight	1
already	1
he	1
rang	1
up	1
his	1
servant	1
dressed	1
in	1
haste	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
completely	1
forgetting	1
the	1
dream	1
and	1
only	1
worried	1
at	1
being	1
late	1
as	1
he	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
karenins	1
entrance	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
and	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
ten	1
minutes	1
to	1
nine	1
a	1
high	1
narrow	1
carriage	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
grays	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
he	1
recognized	1
anna	1
s	1
carriage	1
she	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
me	1
thought	1
vronsky	1
and	1
better	1
she	1
should	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
going	1
into	1
that	1
house	1
but	1
no	1
matter	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
hide	1
myself	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
manner	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
childhood	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
vronsky	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sledge	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
with	1
a	1
rug	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
called	1
the	1
carriage	1
vronsky	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
usually	1
notice	1
details	1
noticed	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
the	1
amazed	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
porter	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
doorway	1
vronsky	1
almost	1
ran	1
up	1
against	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
the	1
gas	1
jet	1
threw	1
its	1
full	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
bloodless	1
sunken	1
face	1
under	1
the	1
black	1
hat	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
cravat	1
brilliant	1
against	1
the	1
beaver	1
of	1
the	1
coat	1
karenin	1
s	1
fixed	1
dull	1
eyes	1
were	1
fastened	1
upon	1
vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
vronsky	1
bowed	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
chewing	1
his	1
lips	1
lifted	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
vronsky	1
saw	1
him	1
without	1
looking	1
round	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
rug	1
and	1
the	1
opera	1
glass	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
disappear	1
vronsky	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
his	1
brows	1
were	1
scowling	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
with	1
a	1
proud	1
and	1
angry	1
light	1
in	1
them	1
what	1
a	1
position	1
he	1
thought	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
fight	1
would	1
stand	1
up	1
for	1
his	1
honor	1
i	1
could	1
act	1
could	1
express	1
my	1
feelings	1
but	1
this	1
weakness	1
or	1
baseness	1
he	1
puts	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
playing	1
false	1
which	1
i	1
never	1
meant	1
and	1
never	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
vronsky	1
s	1
ideas	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
anna	1
in	1
the	1
vrede	1
garden	1
unconsciously	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
anna	1
who	1
had	1
surrendered	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
utterly	1
and	1
simply	1
looked	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
decide	1
her	1
fate	1
ready	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
anything	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
ceased	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
their	1
tie	1
might	1
end	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
then	1
his	1
ambitious	1
plans	1
had	1
retreated	1
into	1
the	1
background	1
again	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
circle	1
of	1
activity	1
in	1
which	1
everything	1
was	1
definite	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
himself	1
entirely	1
to	1
his	1
passion	1
and	1
that	1
passion	1
was	1
binding	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
closely	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
when	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
retreating	1
footsteps	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
expecting	1
him	1
had	1
listened	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
no	1
she	1
cried	1
on	1
seeing	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
the	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
no	1

are	1

laid	1
her	1
two	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
looked	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
profound	1
passionate	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
searching	1
look	1
she	1
was	1
studying	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1

knew	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
up	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
had	1
dropped	1
asleep	1
but	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
thrilled	1
and	1
rapturous	1
face	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
report	1
on	1
the	1

she	1
said	1
knitting	1
her	1
brows	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
crochet	1
work	1
that	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
began	1
drawing	1
the	1
hook	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
vronsky	1
i	1
gave	1
that	1
life	1
up	1
long	1
ago	1
said	1
he	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
divine	1
its	1
meaning	1
and	1
i	1
confess	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
showing	1
his	1
thick	1
white	1
teeth	1
this	1
week	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
seeing	1
that	1
life	1
and	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
like	1
it	1
she	1
held	1
the	1
work	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
crochet	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
strange	1
shining	1
and	1
hostile	1
eyes	1
this	1
morning	1
liza	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
they	1
re	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
me	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
she	1
put	1
in	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
about	1
your	1
athenian	1
evening	1
how	1
loathsome	1
i	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
she	1
interrupted	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
thérèse	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
i	1
was	1
just	1
saying	1
how	1
disgusting	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
men	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
can	1
never	1
forget	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
angry	1
and	1
so	1
letting	1
him	1
see	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
irritation	1
especially	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
cannot	1
know	1
your	1
life	1
what	1
do	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
have	1
i	1
ever	1
known	1
she	1
said	1
what	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
i	1
know	1
whether	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
truth	1
anna	1
you	1
hurt	1
me	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
trust	1
me	1
haven	1
t	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
a	1
thought	1
i	1
wouldn	1
t	1
lay	1
bare	1
to	1
you	1
yes	1
yes	1
she	1
said	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
suppress	1
her	1
jealous	1
thoughts	1
but	1
if	1
only	1
you	1
knew	1
how	1
wretched	1
i	1
am	1
i	1
believe	1
you	1
i	1
believe	1
you	1
what	1
were	1
you	1
saying	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
recall	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
these	1
fits	1
of	1
jealousy	1
which	1
of	1
late	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequent	1
with	1
her	1
horrified	1
him	1
and	1
however	1
much	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
disguise	1
the	1
fact	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
although	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
jealousy	1
was	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
how	1
often	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
her	1
love	1
was	1
happiness	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
can	1
love	1
when	1
love	1
has	1
outweighed	1
for	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
things	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
further	1
from	1
happiness	1
than	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
followed	1
her	1
from	1
moscow	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
himself	1
unhappy	1
but	1
happiness	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
happiness	1
was	1
already	1
left	1
behind	1
she	1
was	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
saw	1
her	1
both	1
morally	1
and	1
physically	1
she	1
had	1
changed	1
for	1
the	1
worse	1
she	1
had	1
broadened	1
out	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
actress	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
evil	1
expression	1
of	1
hatred	1
that	1
distorted	1
it	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
looks	1
at	1
a	1
faded	1
flower	1
he	1
has	1
gathered	1
with	1
difficulty	1
recognizing	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
beauty	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
picked	1
and	1
ruined	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
then	1
when	1
his	1
love	1
was	1
stronger	1
he	1
could	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
greatly	1
wished	1
it	1
have	1
torn	1
that	1
love	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
but	1
now	1
when	1
as	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
no	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
broken	1
well	1
well	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
the	1
prince	1
i	1
have	1
driven	1
away	1
the	1
fiend	1
she	1
added	1
the	1
fiend	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
jealousy	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
begin	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
the	1
prince	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
so	1
tiresome	1
oh	1
it	1
was	1
intolerable	1
he	1
said	1
trying	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
his	1
interrupted	1
thought	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
improve	1
on	1
closer	1
acquaintance	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
him	1
defined	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
prime	1
well	1
fed	1
beast	1
such	1
as	1
takes	1
medals	1
at	1
the	1
cattle	1
shows	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
vexation	1
that	1
interested	1
her	1
no	1
how	1
so	1
she	1
replied	1
he	1
s	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
anyway	1
he	1
s	1
cultured	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
utterly	1
different	1
culture	1
their	1
culture	1
he	1
s	1
cultivated	1
one	1
sees	1
simply	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
despise	1
culture	1
as	1
they	1
despise	1
everything	1
but	1
animal	1
pleasures	1
but	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
all	1
care	1
for	1
these	1
animal	1
pleasures	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
dark	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
avoided	1
him	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
re	1
defending	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
defending	1
him	1
it	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
imagine	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
cared	1
for	1
those	1
pleasures	1
yourself	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
affords	1
you	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
gaze	1
at	1
thérèse	1
in	1
the	1
attire	1
of	1
eve	1
again	1
the	1
devil	1
again	1
vronsky	1
said	1
taking	1
the	1
hand	1
she	1
had	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
kissing	1
it	1
yes	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
suffered	1
waiting	1
for	1
you	1
i	1

i	1

i	1
m	1
not	1

you	1
when	1
you	1
re	1
here	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
re	1
away	1
somewhere	1
leading	1
your	1
life	1
so	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
pulled	1
the	1
hook	1
at	1
last	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crochet	1
work	1
and	1
rapidly	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
her	1
forefinger	1
began	1
working	1
loop	1
after	1
loop	1
of	1
the	1
wool	1
that	1
was	1
dazzling	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
lamplight	1
while	1
the	1
slender	1
wrist	1
moved	1
swiftly	1
nervously	1
in	1
the	1
embroidered	1
cuff	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
then	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
meet	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
her	1
voice	1
sounded	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
and	1
jarring	1
tone	1
we	1
ran	1
up	1
against	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
you	1
like	1
this	1
she	1
drew	1
a	1
long	1
face	1
and	1
half	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
quickly	1
transformed	1
her	1
expression	1
folded	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
vronsky	1
suddenly	1
saw	1
in	1
her	1
beautiful	1
face	1
the	1
very	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
bowed	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
smiled	1
while	1
she	1
laughed	1
gaily	1
with	1
that	1
sweet	1
deep	1
laugh	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
greatest	1
charms	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
said	1
vronsky	1
if	1
after	1
your	1
avowal	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
your	1
country	1
house	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
with	1

this	1
i	1

a	1

hit	1
on	1
other	1
absurd	1

aspects	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
was	1
awaiting	1
the	1
moment	1
to	1
give	1

to	1
them	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
i	1

not	1
illness	1

your	1
condition	1
when	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
ironical	1
light	1
died	1
away	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
a	1
different	1
smile	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
something	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
and	1
of	1
quiet	1
melancholy	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
soon	1
soon	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
our	1
position	1
is	1
miserable	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
it	1
if	1
you	1

how	1
terrible	1

to	1
be	1

myself	1

torture	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
jealousy	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
soon	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
we	1
expect	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
she	1
seemed	1
so	1
pitiable	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
she	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
sleeve	1
dazzling	1
and	1
white	1
with	1
its	1
rings	1
in	1
the	1

i	1

and	1
release	1
myself	1
and	1
you	1
tears	1
dropped	1
from	1
her	1
eyes	1
he	1
bent	1
down	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
began	1
kissing	1
it	1
trying	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
emotion	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
had	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
grounds	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
it	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
better	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
tightly	1
gripping	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
left	1
us	1
he	1
had	1
recovered	1
himself	1
and	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
how	1
absurd	1
what	1
absurd	1
nonsense	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
no	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
truth	1
what	1

that	1
i	1

i	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
dream	1
a	1
dream	1
repeated	1
vronsky	1
and	1
instantly	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
peasant	1
of	1
his	1
dream	1
yes	1
a	1
dream	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
since	1
i	1
dreamed	1
it	1
i	1
dreamed	1
that	1
i	1
ran	1
into	1
my	1
bedroom	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
there	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
something	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
dreams	1
she	1
said	1
her	1
eyes	1
wide	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
stood	1
something	1
oh	1
what	1
nonsense	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
believe	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
interrupt	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
too	1
important	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
something	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
peasant	1
with	1
a	1
disheveled	1
beard	1
little	1
and	1
dreadful	1
looking	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
but	1
he	1
bent	1
down	1
over	1
a	1
sack	1
and	1
was	1
fumbling	1
there	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
she	1
showed	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
moved	1
his	1
hands	1
there	1
was	1
terror	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
vronsky	1
remembering	1
his	1
dream	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
terror	1
filling	1
his	1
soul	1
he	1
was	1
fumbling	1
and	1
kept	1
talking	1
quickly	1
quickly	1
in	1
french	1
you	1
know	1
il	1
faut	1
le	1
battre	1
le	1
fer	1

pétrir	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
horror	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
wake	1
up	1
and	1
woke	1
up	1
but	1
woke	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
dream	1
and	1
i	1
began	1
asking	1
myself	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
and	1
korney	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
childbirth	1
you	1

and	1
i	1
woke	1
up	1
what	1
nonsense	1
what	1
nonsense	1
said	1
vronsky	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1

in	1
his	1
voice	1

but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
stopped	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
instantaneously	1
changed	1
horror	1
and	1
excitement	1
were	1
suddenly	1
replaced	1
by	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
soft	1
solemn	1
blissful	1
attention	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
comprehend	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1

intended	1

sat	1
through	1

there	1
and	1
saw	1
everyone	1

had	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
on	1
returning	1
home	1
he	1
carefully	1
scrutinized	1
the	1
hat	1
stand	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
military	1
overcoat	1
there	1
he	1
went	1
as	1
usual	1
to	1
his	1

contrary	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
habit	1
he	1
did	1
not	1

the	1

complied	1

and	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
threat	1
obtain	1
a	1
divorce	1

he	1
had	1

he	1
would	1

now	1
he	1
must	1

hinted	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
of	1
late	1
the	1
obtaining	1
of	1
divorces	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
to	1
such	1
perfection	1
that	1
alexey	1

saw	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
overcoming	1
the	1
formal	1
difficulties	1
misfortunes	1
never	1

of	1
the	1

brought	1
such	1
official	1
worries	1
upon	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
late	1
in	1
a	1
continual	1
condition	1
of	1
extreme	1
irritability	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
the	1
whole	1
night	1
and	1
his	1
fury	1
growing	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
vast	1
arithmetical	1
progression	1
reached	1
its	1
highest	1
limits	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
dressed	1
in	1
haste	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
carrying	1
his	1
cup	1
full	1
of	1
wrath	1
and	1
fearing	1
to	1
spill	1
any	1
over	1
fearing	1
to	1
lose	1
with	1
his	1
wrath	1
the	1
energy	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
directly	1
he	1
heard	1
she	1
was	1
up	1
anna	1
who	1
had	1
thought	1
she	1
knew	1
her	1
husband	1
so	1
well	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
his	1
appearance	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
brow	1
was	1
lowering	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
stared	1
darkly	1
before	1
him	1
avoiding	1
her	1
eyes	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
tightly	1
and	1
contemptuously	1
shut	1
in	1
his	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
gestures	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
determination	1
and	1
firmness	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
without	1
greeting	1
her	1
walked	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
writing	1
table	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
keys	1
opened	1
a	1
drawer	1
what	1

cried	1
your	1

letters	1
he	1
said	1
they	1
re	1
not	1
here	1
she	1
said	1
shutting	1
the	1
drawer	1
but	1
from	1
that	1
action	1
he	1
saw	1
he	1
had	1
guessed	1
right	1
and	1
roughly	1
pushing	1
away	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
quickly	1
snatched	1
a	1
portfolio	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
most	1
important	1
papers	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
pull	1
the	1
portfolio	1
away	1

he	1
pushed	1
her	1
back	1

down	1
i	1

to	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
putting	1
the	1
portfolio	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
squeezing	1
it	1
so	1
tightly	1
with	1
his	1
elbow	1
that	1
his	1
shoulder	1
stood	1
up	1
amazed	1
and	1
intimidated	1
she	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
you	1
to	1
receive	1
your	1
lover	1
in	1
this	1

her	1

angered	1
her	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
courage	1

for	1
you	1

shrieked	1
in	1
his	1
shrill	1
voice	1
which	1
pitched	1
a	1
note	1
higher	1
than	1
usual	1
even	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
hands	1
clutching	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
so	1
violently	1
that	1

marks	1
were	1

her	1

she	1
did	1
not	1

what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
the	1
evening	1
before	1
to	1
her	1
lover	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
superfluous	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
only	1
said	1
softly	1
you	1
cannot	1
describe	1
my	1
position	1
as	1
worse	1
than	1

feel	1
it	1
to	1

and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
death	1
near	1
at	1

and	1
now	1
desired	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1

than	1
you	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
speaking	1
so	1
quickly	1
that	1
he	1
stammered	1
and	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
articulate	1
the	1
word	1
suffering	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
pronounced	1
it	1
thuffering	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
laugh	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
ashamed	1
that	1
anything	1
could	1
amuse	1
her	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
him	1
put	1
herself	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
what	1
could	1
she	1
say	1
or	1
do	1
her	1
head	1
sank	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
silent	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
frigid	1
less	1
shrill	1
voice	1
emphasizing	1
random	1
words	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
special	1
significance	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
no	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
fancy	1
she	1
thought	1
recalling	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
when	1
he	1
stumbled	1
over	1
the	1
word	1
suffering	1
no	1

those	1
dull	1
eyes	1
with	1

anything	1
i	1
cannot	1
change	1
anything	1
she	1
whispered	1
i	1

come	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1

and	1
you	1
will	1
receive	1
notice	1
of	1
what	1
i	1
decide	1
through	1
the	1
lawyer	1
into	1
whose	1

i	1
shall	1
intrust	1

of	1

going	1
to	1
my	1
sister	1

said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
recalling	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
his	1
son	1
you	1
take	1
seryozha	1
to	1
hurt	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
love	1
him	1
leave	1
me	1
seryozha	1
yes	1
i	1
have	1
lost	1
even	1
my	1
affection	1
for	1
my	1
son	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
repulsion	1
i	1
feel	1
for	1
you	1
but	1
still	1
i	1
shall	1
take	1
him	1
good	1
bye	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
detained	1
him	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
leave	1
me	1
seryozha	1
she	1
whispered	1
once	1
more	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
say	1
leave	1
seryozha	1
till	1
my	1
i	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
confined	1
leave	1
him	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
flew	1
into	1
a	1
rage	1
and	1
snatching	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
her	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
chapter	1
5	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
celebrated	1
petersburg	1
lawyer	1
was	1
full	1
when	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
entered	1
it	1
three	1
ladies	1
an	1
old	1
lady	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
and	1
a	1
merchant	1
s	1
wife	1
and	1
three	1
gentlemen	1
one	1
a	1
german	1
banker	1
with	1
a	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
finger	1
the	1
second	1
a	1
merchant	1
with	1
a	1
beard	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
a	1
wrathful	1
looking	1
government	1
clerk	1
in	1
official	1
uniform	1
with	1
a	1
cross	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
had	1
obviously	1
been	1
waiting	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
already	1
two	1
clerks	1
were	1
writing	1
at	1
tables	1
with	1
scratching	1
pens	1
the	1
appurtenances	1
of	1
the	1
writing	1
tables	1
about	1
which	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
himself	1
very	1
fastidious	1
were	1
exceptionally	1
good	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
observing	1
this	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
clerks	1
without	1
getting	1
up	1
turned	1
wrathfully	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
half	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
wanting	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
lawyer	1
on	1
some	1
business	1
he	1
is	1
engaged	1
the	1
clerk	1
responded	1
severely	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
at	1
the	1
persons	1
waiting	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
writing	1
can	1
t	1
he	1
spare	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
time	1
free	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
busy	1
kindly	1
wait	1
your	1
turn	1
then	1
i	1
must	1
trouble	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
my	1
card	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
with	1
dignity	1
seeing	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
preserving	1
his	1
incognito	1
the	1
clerk	1
took	1
the	1
card	1
and	1
obviously	1
not	1
approving	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
read	1
on	1
it	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
in	1
principle	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
publicity	1
of	1
legal	1
proceedings	1
though	1
for	1
some	1
higher	1
official	1
considerations	1
he	1
disliked	1
the	1
application	1
of	1
the	1
principle	1
in	1
russia	1
and	1
disapproved	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
disapprove	1
of	1
anything	1
instituted	1
by	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
emperor	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
had	1
been	1
spent	1
in	1
administrative	1
work	1
and	1
consequently	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
anything	1
his	1
disapproval	1
was	1
softened	1
by	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
the	1
inevitability	1
of	1
mistakes	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
reform	1
in	1
every	1
department	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
public	1
law	1
courts	1
he	1
disliked	1
the	1
restrictions	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
lawyers	1
conducting	1
cases	1
but	1
till	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
law	1
courts	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
disapproved	1
of	1
their	1
publicity	1
simply	1
in	1
theory	1
now	1
his	1
disapprobation	1
was	1
strengthened	1
by	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
made	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
waiting	1
room	1
coming	1
immediately	1
said	1
the	1
clerk	1
and	1
two	1
minutes	1
later	1
there	1
did	1
actually	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1

an	1
old	1

consulting	1
with	1
the	1

himself	1
the	1

was	1
a	1
little	1
squat	1
bald	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
dark	1
reddish	1
beard	1
light	1
colored	1
long	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
an	1
overhanging	1
brow	1
he	1
was	1
attired	1
as	1
though	1
for	1
a	1
wedding	1
from	1
his	1
cravat	1
to	1
his	1
double	1
watch	1
chain	1
and	1
varnished	1
boots	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
clever	1
and	1
manly	1
but	1
his	1
dress	1
was	1
dandified	1
and	1
in	1
bad	1
taste	1
pray	1
walk	1
in	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
addressing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
gloomily	1
ushering	1
karenin	1
in	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
won	1
t	1
you	1
sit	1
down	1
he	1
indicated	1
an	1
armchair	1
at	1
a	1
writing	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
papers	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
himself	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
little	1
hands	1
with	1
short	1
fingers	1
covered	1
with	1
white	1
hairs	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
settled	1
in	1
this	1
position	1
a	1
moth	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
lawyer	1
with	1
a	1
swiftness	1
that	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
opened	1
his	1
hands	1
caught	1
the	1
moth	1
and	1
resumed	1
his	1
former	1
attitude	1
before	1
beginning	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
my	1
business	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
following	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
movements	1
with	1
wondering	1
eyes	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
the	1
business	1
about	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
strictly	1
private	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
overhanging	1
reddish	1
mustaches	1
were	1
parted	1
in	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
lawyer	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
secrets	1
confided	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
proof	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
shrewd	1
gray	1
eyes	1
were	1
laughing	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
already	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
name	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
resumed	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
again	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
moth	1
work	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
like	1
every	1
russian	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
bowing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
sighed	1
plucking	1
up	1
his	1
courage	1
but	1
having	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
shrill	1
voice	1
without	1
timidity	1
or	1
hesitation	1
accentuating	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
word	1
i	1
have	1
the	1
misfortune	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
deceived	1
in	1
my	1
married	1
life	1
and	1
i	1
desire	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
all	1
relations	1
with	1
my	1
wife	1
by	1
legal	1
means	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
divorced	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
may	1
not	1
remain	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
gray	1
eyes	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
laugh	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
dancing	1
with	1
irrepressible	1
glee	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
simply	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
just	1
got	1
a	1
profitable	1
job	1
there	1
was	1
triumph	1
and	1
joy	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gleam	1
like	1
the	1
malignant	1
gleam	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
eyes	1
you	1
desire	1
my	1
assistance	1
in	1
securing	1
a	1
divorce	1
yes	1
precisely	1
so	1
but	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
warn	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
wasting	1
your	1
time	1
and	1
attention	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
simply	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
preliminary	1
step	1
i	1
want	1
a	1
divorce	1
but	1
the	1
form	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
consequence	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
possible	1
that	1
if	1
that	1
form	1
does	1
not	1
correspond	1
with	1
my	1
requirements	1
i	1
may	1
give	1
up	1
a	1
legal	1
divorce	1
oh	1
that	1
s	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
always	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
decide	1
he	1
let	1
his	1
eyes	1
rest	1
on	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
feet	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
offend	1
his	1
client	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
irrepressible	1
amusement	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
moth	1
that	1
flew	1
before	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
moved	1
his	1
hands	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
catch	1
it	1
from	1
regard	1
for	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
position	1
though	1
in	1
their	1
general	1
features	1
our	1
laws	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
are	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
pursued	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
forms	1
in	1
which	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
done	1
in	1
practice	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
the	1
lawyer	1
without	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes	1
responded	1
adopting	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
satisfaction	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
client	1
s	1
remarks	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
lay	1
before	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
methods	1
by	1
which	1
you	1
could	1
secure	1
what	1
you	1
desire	1
and	1
on	1
receiving	1
an	1
assuring	1
nod	1
from	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
stealing	1
a	1
glance	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
growing	1
red	1
in	1
patches	1
divorce	1
by	1
our	1
laws	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
shade	1
of	1
disapprobation	1
of	1
our	1
laws	1
is	1
possible	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
aware	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
cases	1
wait	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
a	1
clerk	1
who	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
cases	1
physical	1
defect	1
in	1
the	1
married	1
parties	1
desertion	1
without	1
communication	1
for	1
five	1
years	1
he	1
said	1
crooking	1
a	1
short	1
finger	1
covered	1
with	1
hair	1
adultery	1
this	1
word	1
he	1
pronounced	1
with	1
obvious	1
satisfaction	1
subdivided	1
as	1
follows	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
crook	1
his	1
fat	1
fingers	1
though	1
the	1
three	1
cases	1
and	1
their	1
subdivisions	1
could	1
obviously	1
not	1
be	1
classified	1
together	1
physical	1
defect	1
of	1
the	1

or	1
of	1
the	1
wife	1
adultery	1
of	1
the	1
husband	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
wife	1
as	1
by	1
now	1
all	1
his	1
fingers	1
were	1
used	1
up	1
he	1
uncrooked	1
all	1
his	1
fingers	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
theoretical	1
view	1
but	1
i	1
imagine	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
learn	1
its	1
application	1
in	1
practice	1
and	1
therefore	1
guided	1
by	1
precedents	1
i	1
must	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
practice	1
cases	1
of	1
divorce	1
may	1
all	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
physical	1
defect	1
i	1
may	1
assume	1
nor	1
desertion	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
assent	1
may	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
adultery	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
married	1
parties	1
and	1
the	1
detection	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
guilty	1
party	1
by	1
mutual	1
agreement	1
and	1
failing	1
such	1
agreement	1
accidental	1
detection	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
case	1
is	1
rarely	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
practice	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
and	1
stealing	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
he	1
paused	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
selling	1
pistols	1
after	1
enlarging	1
on	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
each	1
weapon	1
might	1
await	1
his	1
customer	1
s	1
choice	1
but	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
nothing	1
and	1
therefore	1
the	1
lawyer	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
usual	1
and	1
simple	1
the	1
sensible	1
course	1
i	1
consider	1
is	1
adultery	1
by	1
mutual	1
consent	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
permit	1
myself	1
to	1
express	1
it	1
so	1
speaking	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
no	1
education	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
i	1
imagine	1
that	1
to	1
you	1
this	1
is	1
comprehensible	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
however	1
so	1
perturbed	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
immediately	1
comprehend	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
of	1
adultery	1
by	1
mutual	1
consent	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
expressed	1
this	1
uncertainty	1
but	1
the	1
lawyer	1
promptly	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
assistance	1
people	1
cannot	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
together	1
here	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
fact	1
and	1
if	1
both	1
are	1
agreed	1
about	1
it	1
the	1
details	1
and	1
formalities	1
become	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
certain	1
method	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
fully	1
understood	1
now	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
religious	1
scruples	1
which	1
hindered	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
plan	1
that	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
he	1
said	1
only	1
one	1
alternative	1
is	1
possible	1
undesigned	1
detection	1
supported	1
by	1
letters	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
letters	1
the	1
lawyer	1
pursed	1
up	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
gave	1
utterance	1
to	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
compassionate	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
sound	1
kindly	1
consider	1
he	1
began	1
cases	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
are	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
aware	1
under	1
ecclesiastical	1
jurisdiction	1
the	1
reverend	1
fathers	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
which	1
betrayed	1
his	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
reverend	1
fathers	1
taste	1
letters	1
may	1
of	1
course	1
be	1
a	1
partial	1
confirmation	1
but	1
detection	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
direct	1
kind	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
eyewitnesses	1
in	1
fact	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
intrust	1
your	1
confidence	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
employed	1
if	1
one	1
wants	1
the	1
result	1
one	1
must	1
admit	1
the	1
means	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
began	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
white	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
lawyer	1
rose	1
and	1
again	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
intruding	1
clerk	1
tell	1
her	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
haggle	1
over	1
fees	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
he	1
caught	1
unobserved	1
another	1
moth	1

by	1

he	1
thought	1
frowning	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
will	1
communicate	1
my	1
decision	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
letter	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
he	1
clutched	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
after	1
standing	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
silence	1
he	1
said	1
from	1
your	1
words	1
i	1
may	1
consequently	1
conclude	1
that	1
a	1
divorce	1
may	1
be	1
obtained	1
i	1
would	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
terms	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
obtained	1
if	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
complete	1
liberty	1
of	1
action	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
not	1
answering	1
his	1
question	1
when	1
can	1
i	1
reckon	1
on	1
receiving	1
information	1
from	1
you	1
he	1
asked	1
moving	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
varnished	1
boots	1
shining	1
in	1
a	1

your	1
answer	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
you	1
will	1
undertake	1
to	1
conduct	1
the	1
case	1
and	1
on	1
what	1
terms	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
me	1
very	1
good	1
the	1
lawyer	1
bowed	1
respectfully	1
let	1
his	1
client	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
left	1
alone	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
amusement	1
he	1
felt	1
so	1
mirthful	1
that	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
rules	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
reduction	1
in	1
his	1
terms	1
to	1
the	1
haggling	1
lady	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
catching	1

deciding	1
that	1

victory	1
at	1

its	1
political	1
administrative	1
economic	1
ethnographic	1
material	1
and	1
religious	1
aspects	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
questions	1
there	1
were	1
answers	1
admirably	1
stated	1
and	1
answers	1
admitting	1
no	1
shade	1
of	1
doubt	1
since	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
product	1
of	1
human	1

always	1
liable	1
to	1
error	1

were	1
all	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
official	1
activity	1

based	1
on	1

all	1
of	1
these	1

were	1
unhesitating	1
and	1
certain	1
all	1
such	1
questions	1

are	1

cannot	1
be	1
solved	1
for	1
ages	1
received	1
full	1
unhesitating	1
solution	1
and	1
this	1
solution	1
was	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
alexey	1

stremov	1
who	1

felt	1
stung	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
sitting	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
the	1

s	1
report	1
resorted	1
to	1
tactics	1
which	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
not	1
anticipated	1
stremov	1
carrying	1
with	1
him	1
several	1
members	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
side	1
and	1
not	1
contenting	1
himself	1
with	1
warmly	1
defending	1
the	1

proposed	1
by	1
karenin	1
proposed	1
other	1
more	1
extreme	1
measures	1
in	1
the	1

direction	1
these	1
measures	1
still	1
further	1
exaggerated	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
fundamental	1
idea	1
were	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
commission	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
stremov	1
s	1
tactics	1
became	1
apparent	1
carried	1
to	1
an	1
extreme	1
the	1
measures	1
seemed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
absurd	1
that	1
the	1
highest	1
authorities	1
and	1
public	1
opinion	1
and	1
intellectual	1
ladies	1
and	1
the	1
newspapers	1
all	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
fell	1
foul	1
of	1
them	1
expressing	1
their	1
indignation	1
both	1
with	1
the	1
measures	1
and	1
their	1
nominal	1
father	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
stremov	1
drew	1
back	1
affecting	1
to	1
have	1
blindly	1
followed	1
karenin	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
astounded	1
and	1
distressed	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
this	1
meant	1
the	1
defeat	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
failing	1
health	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
domestic	1
griefs	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
in	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
split	1
in	1
the	1
commission	1
some	1
members	1
with	1
stremov	1
at	1
their	1
head	1
justified	1
their	1
mistake	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
put	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
revision	1
instituted	1
by	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
commission	1
was	1
rubbish	1
and	1
simply	1
so	1
much	1
waste	1
paper	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
with	1
a	1
following	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
so	1
revolutionary	1
an	1
attitude	1
to	1
official	1
documents	1
persisted	1
in	1
upholding	1
the	1
statements	1
obtained	1
by	1
the	1
revising	1
commission	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
spheres	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
society	1
all	1
was	1
chaos	1
and	1
although	1
everyone	1
was	1
interested	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
tell	1
whether	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
really	1
were	1
becoming	1
impoverished	1
and	1
ruined	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
flourishing	1
condition	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
owing	1
to	1
this	1
and	1
partly	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
contempt	1
lavished	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
infidelity	1
became	1
very	1
precarious	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
position	1
he	1
took	1
an	1
important	1
resolution	1
to	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
commission	1
he	1
announced	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
ask	1
permission	1
to	1
go	1
himself	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
question	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
and	1
having	1
obtained	1
permission	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
prepared	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
these	1
remote	1
provinces	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
departure	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
sensation	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
just	1
before	1
he	1
started	1
he	1
officially	1
returned	1
the	1
posting	1

allowed	1
him	1
for	1
twelve	1
horses	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
his	1
destination	1

think	1
it	1
very	1
noble	1

about	1

a	1
pretty	1
dancing	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
taken	1
under	1
his	1
protection	1
the	1
coral	1
necklace	1

asparagus	1
for	1
dinner	1
and	1
by	1
twelve	1
o	1

where	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
three	1
people	1
luckily	1
all	1
staying	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
hotel	1
levin	1
who	1
had	1
recently	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
abroad	1
and	1
was	1
staying	1
there	1
the	1
new	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
promoted	1

had	1
come	1
on	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1

to	1
moscow	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
karenin	1
whom	1
he	1
must	1
see	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
bringing	1
him	1
to	1
dinner	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
liked	1
dining	1
but	1
still	1
better	1
he	1
liked	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
dinner	1
small	1
but	1
very	1
choice	1
both	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
food	1
and	1
drink	1
and	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
selection	1
of	1
guests	1
he	1
particularly	1
liked	1
the	1
program	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
s	1
dinner	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
fresh	1
perch	1
asparagus	1
and	1
la	1
pièce	1
de	1
resistance	1
first	1
rate	1
but	1
quite	1
plain	1
roast	1
beef	1
and	1
wines	1
to	1
suit	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
kitty	1
and	1
levin	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
might	1
not	1
be	1

of	1

was	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
light	1
hearted	1
mood	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
circumstances	1
a	1
little	1
unpleasant	1

these	1
two	1
circumstances	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
good	1
humored	1
gaiety	1
which	1
flooded	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
these	1
two	1
circumstances	1
were	1
first	1
that	1
on	1
meeting	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
reserved	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
putting	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
or	1
let	1
them	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
with	1
the	1
rumors	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
about	1
anna	1
and	1
vronsky	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
guessed	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
wrong	1
between	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
that	1
was	1
one	1
disagreeable	1
thing	1
the	1
other	1
slightly	1
disagreeable	1
fact	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
like	1
all	1
new	1
heads	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
already	1
of	1
a	1
terrible	1
person	1
who	1
got	1
up	1
at	1
six	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
worked	1
like	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
his	1
subordinates	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
moreover	1
this	1
new	1
head	1
had	1
the	1
further	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
bear	1
in	1
his	1
manners	1
and	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
reports	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
class	1
in	1
all	1
respects	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
that	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
predecessor	1
had	1
belonged	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
hitherto	1
belonged	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
office	1
in	1
a	1
uniform	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
chief	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
affable	1
and	1
had	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
consequently	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
deemed	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
non	1
official	1
dress	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
chief	1
might	1
not	1
tender	1
him	1
a	1
warm	1
reception	1
was	1
the	1
other	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
but	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
instinctively	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
come	1
round	1
all	1
right	1
they	1
re	1
all	1
people	1
all	1

he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hotel	1

day	1
vassily	1

said	1
walking	1
into	1
the	1

with	1
a	1

from	1

in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
measuring	1

he	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
peasant	1

sat	1
down	1
on	1

edge	1
of	1
a	1

he	1
threw	1
open	1
his	1
coat	1
but	1
afterwards	1
did	1
take	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
hour	1
talking	1
to	1

about	1

in	1
england	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
capitals	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
manufacturing	1
towns	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
that	1
was	1
new	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
i	1
went	1
yes	1
i	1
knew	1
your	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
labor	1
question	1
not	1
a	1

in	1
russia	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
labor	1
question	1
in	1

the	1
question	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
working	1
people	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
exists	1
there	1
too	1
but	1
there	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
repairing	1
what	1
s	1
been	1
ruined	1
while	1
with	1
us	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
levin	1
yes	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
possible	1
you	1
re	1
right	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
you	1
re	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
and	1
are	1
hunting	1
bears	1
and	1
working	1
and	1
interested	1
shtcherbatsky	1
told	1
me	1
another	1
story	1
he	1
met	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
depressed	1
state	1
talking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
death	1
well	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
ve	1
not	1
given	1
up	1
thinking	1
of	1
death	1
said	1
levin	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
high	1
time	1
i	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
nonsense	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
truth	1
i	1
m	1
telling	1
you	1
i	1
do	1
value	1
my	1
idea	1
and	1
my	1
work	1
awfully	1
but	1
in	1
reality	1
only	1
consider	1
this	1
all	1
this	1
world	1
of	1
ours	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
speck	1
of	1
mildew	1
which	1
has	1
grown	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
tiny	1
planet	1
and	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
suppose	1
we	1
can	1
have	1
something	1
great	1
ideas	1
work	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
dust	1
and	1
ashes	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
s	1
as	1
old	1
as	1
the	1
hills	1
my	1
boy	1
it	1
is	1
old	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
when	1
you	1
grasp	1
this	1
fully	1
then	1
somehow	1
everything	1
becomes	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
when	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
die	1
tomorrow	1
if	1
not	1
today	1
and	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
left	1
then	1
everything	1
is	1
so	1
unimportant	1
and	1
i	1
consider	1
my	1
idea	1
very	1
important	1
but	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
really	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
unimportant	1
too	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
carried	1
out	1
as	1
doing	1
for	1
that	1
bear	1
so	1
one	1
goes	1
on	1
living	1
amusing	1
oneself	1
with	1
hunting	1
with	1
work	1
anything	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
death	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
a	1
subtle	1
affectionate	1
smile	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
levin	1
well	1
of	1
course	1
here	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
my	1
point	1

you	1

you	1
attacked	1
me	1
for	1
seeking	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
life	1
don	1

moralist	1
no	1
all	1

oh	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
all	1
i	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
dead	1
why	1
so	1
soon	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
there	1
s	1
less	1
charm	1
in	1
life	1
when	1
one	1
thinks	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
there	1
s	1
more	1
peace	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
finish	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
best	1

i	1
must	1

said	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
inquire	1
about	1
kitty	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
petersburg	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
diplomat	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
or	1
not	1
but	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
whether	1
she	1
s	1
coming	1
or	1
not	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
so	1
you	1

come	1
of	1

at	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
then	1
and	1
not	1
evening	1

and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
below	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
instinct	1
had	1
not	1
misled	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
the	1
terrible	1
new	1
head	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
extremely	1
amenable	1
person	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
lunched	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
stayed	1
on	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
before	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
chapter	1
8	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
on	1
coming	1
back	1
from	1
church	1
service	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
indoors	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
pieces	1
of	1
business	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
morning	1
first	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
send	1
on	1
a	1
deputation	1
from	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
petersburg	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
moscow	1
secondly	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
promised	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
lawyer	1
the	1
deputation	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
summoned	1
at	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
instigation	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
its	1
discomforting	1
and	1
even	1
dangerous	1
aspect	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
it	1
in	1
moscow	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
this	1
deputation	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
conception	1
of	1
their	1
duty	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
play	1
they	1
naïvely	1
believed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
business	1
to	1
lay	1
before	1
the	1
commission	1
their	1
needs	1
and	1
the	1
actual	1
condition	1
of	1
things	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
assistance	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
utterly	1
failed	1
to	1
grasp	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
statements	1
and	1
requests	1
supported	1
the	1
contention	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
s	1
side	1
and	1
so	1
spoiled	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
busily	1
engaged	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
program	1
for	1
them	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
depart	1
and	1
on	1
dismissing	1
them	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
petersburg	1
for	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
the	1
deputation	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
chief	1
support	1
in	1
this	1
affair	1
in	1
the	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
specialist	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
deputations	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
better	1
than	1
she	1
how	1
to	1
manage	1
them	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
having	1
completed	1
this	1
task	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
wrote	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
lawyer	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
hesitation	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
permission	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
judge	1
best	1
in	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
enclosed	1
three	1
of	1
vronsky	1
s	1
notes	1
to	1
anna	1
which	1

in	1
the	1
portfolio	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
away	1
since	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
left	1
home	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
not	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
again	1
and	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
though	1
only	1
to	1
one	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
since	1
especially	1
he	1
had	1
translated	1
the	1
matter	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
real	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
ink	1
and	1
paper	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
used	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
intention	1
and	1
by	1
now	1
distinctly	1
perceived	1
the	1
feasibility	1
of	1
its	1
execution	1
he	1
was	1
sealing	1
the	1
envelope	1
to	1
the	1
lawyer	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
loud	1
tones	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
voice	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
disputing	1
with	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
servant	1
and	1
insisting	1
on	1
being	1
announced	1
no	1
matter	1
thought	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
i	1
will	1
inform	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
explain	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
dine	1
with	1
him	1
come	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
collecting	1
his	1
papers	1
and	1
putting	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
blotting	1
paper	1
there	1
you	1
see	1
you	1
re	1
talking	1
nonsense	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
at	1
home	1
responded	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
voice	1
addressing	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
in	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
oblonsky	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
well	1
i	1
m	1
awfully	1
glad	1
i	1
ve	1
found	1
you	1
so	1
i	1
hope	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
began	1
cheerfully	1
i	1
cannot	1
come	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
coldly	1
standing	1
and	1
not	1
asking	1
his	1
visitor	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
thought	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
those	1
frigid	1
relations	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
stand	1
with	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
against	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
a	1
suit	1
for	1
divorce	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
into	1
account	1
the	1
ocean	1
of	1
kindliness	1
brimming	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
opened	1
wide	1
his	1
clear	1
shining	1
eyes	1
why	1
can	1
t	1
you	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
he	1
asked	1
in	1
perplexity	1
speaking	1
in	1
french	1
oh	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
promise	1
and	1
we	1
re	1
all	1
counting	1
on	1
you	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
dine	1
at	1
your	1
house	1
because	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
relationship	1
which	1
have	1
existed	1
between	1
us	1
must	1
cease	1
how	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
for	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
because	1
i	1
am	1
beginning	1
an	1
action	1
for	1
divorce	1
against	1
your	1
sister	1
my	1
wife	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
but	1
before	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
his	1
sentence	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
behaving	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
he	1
groaned	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
an	1
armchair	1
no	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
saying	1
cried	1
oblonsky	1
and	1
his	1
suffering	1
was	1
apparent	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
excuse	1
me	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
sat	1
down	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
words	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
he	1
anticipated	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unavoidable	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
that	1
whatever	1
explanations	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
would	1
remain	1
unchanged	1
yes	1
i	1
am	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
painful	1
necessity	1
of	1
seeking	1
a	1
divorce	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
will	1
say	1
one	1
thing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
for	1
an	1
excellent	1
upright	1
man	1
i	1
know	1
anna	1
excuse	1
me	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
change	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
an	1
excellent	1
woman	1
and	1
so	1
excuse	1
me	1
i	1
cannot	1
believe	1
it	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
misunderstanding	1
said	1
he	1
oh	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
merely	1
a	1
misunderstanding	1
pardon	1
i	1
understand	1
interposed	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
one	1
thing	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
act	1
in	1
haste	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
you	1

i	1
am	1
not	1
acting	1
in	1
haste	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
coldly	1
but	1
one	1
cannot	1
ask	1
advice	1
of	1
anyone	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
matter	1
i	1
have	1
quite	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
this	1
is	1
awful	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
i	1
would	1
do	1
one	1
thing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
i	1
beseech	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
no	1
action	1
has	1
yet	1
been	1
taken	1
if	1
i	1
understand	1
rightly	1
before	1
you	1
take	1
advice	1
see	1
my	1
wife	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
loves	1
anna	1
like	1
a	1
sister	1
she	1
loves	1
you	1
and	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
wonderful	1
woman	1
for	1
god	1

sake	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
do	1
me	1
that	1
favor	1
i	1
beseech	1
you	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
pondered	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
sympathetically	1
without	1
interrupting	1
his	1
silence	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
that	1
was	1
just	1
why	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
i	1
imagine	1
our	1
relations	1
must	1
change	1
why	1
so	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
that	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
apart	1
from	1
our	1
connection	1
you	1
have	1
for	1
me	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
part	1
the	1
same	1
friendly	1
feeling	1
i	1
have	1
always	1
had	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
sincere	1
esteem	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
even	1
if	1
your	1
worst	1
suppositions	1
were	1
correct	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
and	1
never	1
would	1
take	1
on	1
myself	1
to	1
judge	1
either	1
side	1
and	1
i	1
see	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
our	1
relations	1
should	1
be	1
affected	1
but	1
now	1
do	1
this	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
wife	1
well	1
we	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
differently	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
coldly	1
however	1
we	1
won	1
t	1
discuss	1
it	1
no	1
why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
you	1
come	1
today	1
to	1
dine	1
anyway	1
my	1
wife	1
s	1
expecting	1
you	1
please	1
do	1
come	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
wonderful	1
woman	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
on	1
my	1

i	1
implore	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
wish	1
it	1
i	1
will	1
come	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
sighing	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
inquired	1
about	1
what	1
interested	1
them	1
both	1
the	1
new	1
head	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
department	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
yet	1
old	1
who	1
had	1
suddenly	1
been	1
promoted	1
to	1
so	1
high	1
a	1
position	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
previously	1
felt	1
no	1
liking	1
for	1
count	1
anitchkin	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
differed	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
opinions	1
but	1
now	1
from	1
a	1
feeling	1
readily	1
comprehensible	1
to	1
officials	1
that	1
hatred	1
felt	1
by	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
suffered	1
a	1
defeat	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
for	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
received	1
a	1
promotion	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
him	1
well	1
have	1
you	1
seen	1
him	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
with	1
a	1
malignant	1
smile	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
our	1
sitting	1
yesterday	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
work	1
capitally	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
energetic	1
yes	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
energy	1
directed	1
to	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
is	1
he	1
aiming	1
at	1
doing	1
anything	1
or	1
simply	1
undoing	1
what	1
s	1
been	1
done	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
great	1
misfortune	1
of	1
our	1
government	1
this	1
paper	1
administration	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
worthy	1
representative	1
really	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
fault	1
one	1
could	1
find	1
with	1
him	1
his	1
policy	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
fellow	1
answered	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
i	1
ve	1
just	1
been	1
seeing	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
really	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
we	1
lunched	1
together	1
and	1
i	1
taught	1
him	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
drink	1
wine	1
and	1
oranges	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
cooling	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
wonder	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
it	1
he	1
liked	1
it	1
awfully	1
no	1
really	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
why	1

four	1
already	1
and	1
i	1

so	1
please	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
dinner	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
how	1
you	1
will	1
grieve	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
me	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
out	1
was	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
i	1
ve	1
promised	1
and	1
i	1
ll	1
come	1
he	1
answered	1
wearily	1
believe	1
me	1
i	1
appreciate	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
regret	1
it	1
answered	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
he	1
patted	1
the	1
footman	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
chuckled	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
at	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
not	1
evening	1
dress	1
please	1
he	1
shouted	1
once	1
more	1
turning	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
chapter	1
9	1
it	1
was	1
past	1
five	1
and	1
several	1
guests	1
had	1
already	1
arrived	1
before	1
the	1
host	1
himself	1
got	1
home	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
together	1
with	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
koznishev	1
and	1
pestsov	1
who	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
street	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
leading	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
moscow	1
intellectuals	1
as	1
oblonsky	1
had	1
called	1
them	1
both	1
were	1
men	1
respected	1
for	1
their	1
character	1
and	1
their	1
intelligence	1
they	1
respected	1
each	1
other	1
but	1
were	1
in	1
complete	1
and	1
hopeless	1
disagreement	1
upon	1
almost	1
every	1
subject	1
not	1
because	1
they	1
belonged	1
to	1
opposite	1
parties	1
but	1
precisely	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
party	1
their	1
enemies	1
refused	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
distinction	1
between	1
their	1
views	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
party	1
each	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
special	1
shade	1
of	1
opinion	1
and	1
since	1
no	1
difference	1
is	1
less	1
easily	1
overcome	1
than	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
about	1
semi	1
abstract	1
questions	1
they	1
never	1
agreed	1
in	1
any	1
opinion	1
and	1
had	1
long	1
indeed	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
jeer	1
without	1
anger	1
each	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
s	1
incorrigible	1
aberrations	1
they	1
were	1
just	1
going	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
when	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
overtook	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
there	1
were	1
already	1
sitting	1
prince	1
alexander	1
dmitrievitch	1
shtcherbatsky	1
young	1
shtcherbatsky	1
turovtsin	1
kitty	1
and	1
karenin	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
immediately	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
not	1
going	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
without	1
him	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
in	1
her	1
best	1
gray	1
silk	1
gown	1
obviously	1
worried	1
about	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
dinner	1
by	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
absence	1
was	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
party	1
mix	1
without	1
him	1
all	1
were	1
sitting	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
priests	1
wives	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
so	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
expressed	1
it	1
obviously	1
wondering	1
why	1
they	1
were	1
there	1
and	1
pumping	1
up	1
remarks	1
simply	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
silent	1
turovtsin	1
good	1
simple	1
man	1
felt	1
unmistakably	1
a	1
fish	1
out	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
thick	1
lips	1
greeted	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
said	1
as	1
plainly	1
as	1
words	1
well	1
old	1
boy	1
you	1
have	1
popped	1
me	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
learned	1
set	1
a	1
drinking	1
party	1
now	1
or	1
the	1
château	1
des	1
fleurs	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
line	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
sat	1
in	1
silence	1
his	1
bright	1
little	1
eyes	1
watching	1
karenin	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
formed	1
a	1
phrase	1
to	1
sum	1
up	1
that	1
politician	1
of	1
whom	1
guests	1
were	1
invited	1
to	1
partake	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
sturgeon	1
kitty	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
calling	1
up	1
all	1
her	1
energies	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
from	1
blushing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
young	1
shtcherbatsky	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
introduced	1
to	1
karenin	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
conscious	1
of	1
it	1
karenin	1
himself	1
had	1
followed	1
the	1
petersburg	1
fashion	1
for	1
a	1
dinner	1
with	1
ladies	1
and	1
was	1
wearing	1
evening	1
dress	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
tie	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
by	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
simply	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
promise	1
and	1
was	1
performing	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
duty	1
in	1
being	1
present	1
at	1
this	1
gathering	1
he	1
was	1
indeed	1
the	1
person	1
chiefly	1
responsible	1
for	1
the	1
chill	1
benumbing	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
before	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
came	1
in	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
apologized	1
explaining	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
detained	1
by	1
that	1
prince	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
scapegoat	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
absences	1
and	1
unpunctualities	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
acquainted	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
bringing	1
together	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
sergey	1
koznishev	1
started	1
them	1
on	1
a	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
russification	1
of	1
poland	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
immediately	1
plunged	1
with	1
pestsov	1
slapping	1
turovtsin	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
he	1
whispered	1
something	1
comic	1
in	1
his	1
ear	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
then	1
he	1
told	1
kitty	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
very	1
pretty	1
that	1
evening	1
and	1
presented	1
shtcherbatsky	1
to	1
karenin	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
kneaded	1
together	1
the	1
social	1
dough	1
that	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
became	1
very	1
lively	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
merry	1
buzz	1
of	1
voices	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
arrived	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
as	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
found	1
to	1
his	1
horror	1
that	1
the	1
port	1
and	1
sherry	1
had	1
been	1
procured	1
from	1
depré	1
and	1
not	1
from	1
levy	1
and	1
directing	1
that	1
the	1
coachman	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
off	1
as	1
speedily	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1

he	1
was	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
the	1

was	1

his	1

a	1
lot	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
s	1
here	1
asked	1
levin	1
unable	1
to	1
help	1
blushing	1
as	1
he	1
knocked	1
the	1
snow	1
off	1
his	1

with	1
his	1
glove	1
all	1

to	1
karenin	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
liberal	1
views	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
to	1
meet	1
karenin	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
felt	1
a	1
flattering	1
distinction	1
and	1
so	1
treated	1
his	1
best	1
friends	1
to	1
this	1
honor	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
konstantin	1
levin	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
to	1
feel	1
all	1
the	1
gratification	1
of	1
making	1
such	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
kitty	1
since	1
that	1
memorable	1
evening	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
vronsky	1
not	1
counting	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
highroad	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
her	1
here	1
today	1
but	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
thoughts	1
free	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
suddenly	1
conscious	1
of	1
such	1
delight	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
of	1
such	1
dread	1
that	1
his	1
breath	1
failed	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
like	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
like	1
like	1
what	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
or	1
like	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
what	1
if	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
told	1
the	1
truth	1
why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
truth	1
he	1
thought	1
oh	1
please	1
introduce	1
me	1
to	1
karenin	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
desperately	1
determined	1
step	1
he	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
beheld	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
nor	1
was	1
she	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
different	1
she	1
was	1
scared	1
shy	1
shame	1
faced	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
charming	1
from	1
it	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
expecting	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
delighted	1
and	1
so	1
confused	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
delight	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
dolly	1
who	1
saw	1
it	1
all	1
thought	1
she	1
would	1
break	1
down	1
and	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
cry	1
she	1
crimsoned	1
turned	1
white	1
crimsoned	1
again	1
and	1
grew	1
faint	1
waiting	1
with	1
quivering	1
lips	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
bowed	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
without	1
speaking	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
slight	1
quiver	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
moisture	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
made	1
them	1
brighter	1
her	1
smile	1
was	1
almost	1
calm	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
how	1
long	1
it	1
is	1
since	1
we	1
ve	1
seen	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
with	1
desperate	1
determination	1
she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
her	1
cold	1
hand	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
seen	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
ve	1
seen	1
you	1
said	1
levin	1
with	1
a	1
radiant	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
i	1
saw	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
driving	1
from	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
to	1
ergushovo	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
wondering	1
you	1
were	1
driving	1
to	1
ergushovo	1
said	1
levin	1
feeling	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
sob	1
with	1
the	1
rapture	1
that	1
was	1
flooding	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
how	1
dared	1
i	1
associate	1
a	1
thought	1
of	1
anything	1
not	1
innocent	1
with	1
this	1
touching	1
creature	1
and	1
yes	1
i	1
do	1
believe	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
what	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
thought	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
karenin	1
let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
he	1
mentioned	1
their	1
names	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
again	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
coldly	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
levin	1
you	1
are	1
acquainted	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
asked	1
in	1
surprise	1
we	1
spent	1
three	1
hours	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
said	1
levin	1
smiling	1
but	1
got	1
out	1
just	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
masquerade	1
quite	1
mystified	1
at	1
least	1
i	1
was	1
nonsense	1
come	1
along	1
please	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
pointing	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
the	1
men	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
table	1
laid	1
with	1
six	1
sorts	1
of	1
spirits	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
kinds	1
of	1
cheese	1
some	1
with	1
little	1
silver	1
spades	1
and	1
some	1
without	1
caviar	1
herrings	1
preserves	1
of	1
various	1
kinds	1
and	1
plates	1
with	1
slices	1
of	1
french	1
bread	1
the	1
men	1
stood	1
round	1
the	1
strong	1
smelling	1
spirits	1
and	1
salt	1
delicacies	1
and	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
russification	1
of	1
poland	1
between	1
koznishev	1
karenin	1
and	1
pestsov	1
died	1
down	1
in	1
anticipation	1
of	1
dinner	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
unequaled	1
in	1
his	1
skill	1
in	1
winding	1
up	1
the	1
most	1
heated	1
and	1
serious	1
argument	1
by	1
some	1
unexpected	1
pinch	1
of	1
attic	1
salt	1
that	1
changed	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
his	1
opponent	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
now	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
been	1
maintaining	1
that	1
the	1
russification	1
of	1
poland	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
accomplished	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
larger	1
measures	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
introduced	1
by	1
the	1
russian	1
government	1
pestsov	1
insisted	1
that	1
one	1
country	1
can	1
only	1
absorb	1
another	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
densely	1
populated	1
koznishev	1
admitted	1
both	1
points	1
but	1
with	1
limitations	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
conclude	1
the	1
argument	1
koznishev	1
said	1
smiling	1
so	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
russification	1
of	1
our	1
foreign	1
populations	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
method	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
as	1
many	1
children	1
as	1
one	1
can	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
i	1
are	1
terribly	1
in	1
fault	1
i	1
see	1
you	1
married	1
men	1
especially	1
you	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
are	1
the	1
real	1
patriots	1
what	1
number	1
have	1
you	1
reached	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
genially	1
at	1
their	1
host	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
a	1
tiny	1
wine	1
glass	1
to	1
him	1
everyone	1
laughed	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
with	1
particular	1
good	1
humor	1
oh	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
best	1
method	1
he	1
said	1
munching	1
cheese	1
and	1
filling	1
the	1
wine	1
glass	1
with	1
a	1
special	1
sort	1
of	1
spirit	1
the	1
conversation	1
dropped	1
at	1
the	1
jest	1
this	1
cheese	1
is	1
not	1
bad	1
shall	1
i	1
give	1
you	1
some	1
said	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
why	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
going	1
in	1
for	1
gymnastics	1
again	1
he	1
asked	1
levin	1
pinching	1
his	1
muscle	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
levin	1
smiled	1
bent	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
under	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
fingers	1
the	1
muscles	1
swelled	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
sound	1
cheese	1
hard	1
as	1
a	1
knob	1
of	1
iron	1
through	1
the	1
fine	1
cloth	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
mistiest	1
notions	1
about	1
the	1
chase	1
he	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
spread	1
with	1
cheese	1
a	1
wafer	1
of	1
bread	1
fine	1
as	1
a	1
spider	1

not	1
at	1
all	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1

said	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
moving	1
aside	1
for	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
were	1
approaching	1

kitty	1
trying	1
assiduously	1
to	1
catch	1
with	1
her	1
fork	1
a	1
perverse	1
mushroom	1
that	1
would	1
slip	1
away	1

on	1

she	1
added	1
turning	1
her	1
charming	1
little	1
head	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
smiling	1
there	1
was	1
apparently	1
nothing	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
what	1
unutterable	1
meaning	1
there	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
every	1
sound	1
in	1
every	1
turn	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
her	1
eyes	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
entreaty	1
for	1
forgiveness	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
tenderness	1
soft	1
timid	1
tenderness	1
and	1
promise	1
and	1
hope	1
and	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
believe	1
in	1
and	1
which	1
choked	1
him	1
with	1
happiness	1

said	1
with	1
a	1

it	1
was	1
an	1
amusing	1
meeting	1

he	1
began	1
telling	1
with	1
droll	1
good	1
humor	1
how	1
after	1
not	1
sleeping	1
all	1

attire	1
but	1
thereupon	1
i	1
began	1
expressing	1
my	1
feelings	1
in	1
elevated	1
language	1
and	1
you	1
too	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
karenin	1
and	1
forgetting	1
his	1
name	1
at	1
first	1
would	1
have	1
ejected	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
coat	1
but	1
afterwards	1
you	1
took	1
my	1
part	1
for	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
extremely	1
grateful	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
passengers	1
generally	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
seats	1
are	1
too	1
ill	1
defined	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
rubbing	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
on	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
i	1
saw	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
about	1
me	1
said	1
levin	1
smiling	1
good	1
naturedly	1
but	1
i	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
plunge	1
into	1
intellectual	1
conversation	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
my	1
attire	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
while	1
he	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
their	1
hostess	1
had	1
one	1
ear	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
he	1
glanced	1
askance	1
at	1
him	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him	1
today	1
why	1
such	1
a	1
conquering	1
hero	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
levin	1
was	1
feeling	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
wings	1
levin	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
room	1
only	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
there	1
existed	1
for	1
him	1
only	1
himself	1
with	1
enormously	1
increased	1
importance	1
and	1
dignity	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
giddy	1
and	1
far	1
away	1
down	1
below	1
were	1
all	1
those	1
nice	1
excellent	1
karenins	1
oblonskys	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
quite	1
without	1
attracting	1
notice	1
without	1
glancing	1
at	1
them	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
other	1
places	1

and	1
kitty	1

by	1
side	1
oh	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
sit	1
there	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
levin	1
the	1
dinner	1
was	1
as	1
choice	1
as	1
the	1
china	1
in	1
which	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
a	1
connoisseur	1
the	1

splendid	1
success	1

and	1
were	1
irreproachable	1
the	1
two	1
footmen	1
and	1
matvey	1
in	1
white	1
cravats	1
did	1
their	1
duty	1
with	1
the	1
dishes	1
and	1

unobtrusively	1
quietly	1
and	1
swiftly	1
on	1
the	1
material	1
side	1
the	1
dinner	1
was	1
a	1
success	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
immaterial	1
the	1
conversation	1
at	1
times	1
general	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
between	1
individuals	1
never	1
paused	1
and	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
company	1
was	1
so	1
lively	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
without	1
stopping	1
speaking	1
and	1
even	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
thawed	1

pestsov	1
liked	1
thrashing	1
an	1
argument	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
words	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
he	1
said	1
over	1
the	1
soup	1
addressing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
mere	1
density	1
of	1
population	1
alone	1
but	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
fundamental	1
ideas	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
principles	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
languidly	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
haste	1
that	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
influence	1
over	1
another	1
people	1
is	1
only	1
possible	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
has	1
the	1
higher	1
development	1
which	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
question	1
pestsov	1
broke	1
in	1
in	1
his	1
bass	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
seemed	1
always	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
into	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
make	1
higher	1

consist	1
the	1
english	1
the	1
french	1
the	1

which	1
is	1
at	1
the	1

stage	1
of	1

of	1
them	1
will	1
nationalize	1

we	1
see	1
the	1

have	1
been	1
turned	1
french	1
but	1
the	1

are	1
not	1
at	1

he	1
shouted	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
law	1
at	1
work	1
there	1
i	1
fancy	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
influence	1
is	1
always	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
true	1

slightly	1
lifting	1
his	1

what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
as	1
the	1
outward	1
signs	1
of	1
true	1
civilization	1
said	1
pestsov	1
i	1
imagine	1
such	1
signs	1
are	1
generally	1
very	1
well	1
known	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
but	1
are	1
they	1
fully	1
known	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
put	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
accepted	1
view	1
now	1
that	1
real	1
culture	1
must	1
be	1
purely	1
classical	1
but	1
we	1
see	1
most	1
intense	1
disputes	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
denying	1
that	1
the	1
opposite	1
camp	1
has	1
strong	1
points	1
in	1
its	1
favor	1
you	1
are	1
for	1
classics	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
will	1
you	1
take	1
red	1

said	1
stepan	1

i	1
am	1
not	1
expressing	1
my	1
own	1
opinion	1
of	1
either	1
form	1
of	1
culture	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
said	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
glass	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
condescension	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
i	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
both	1
sides	1
have	1
strong	1
arguments	1
to	1
support	1
them	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
addressing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
my	1
sympathies	1
are	1
classical	1
from	1
education	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
discussion	1
i	1
am	1
personally	1
unable	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
a	1
conclusion	1
i	1
see	1
no	1
distinct	1
grounds	1
for	1
classical	1
studies	1
being	1
given	1
a	1
preeminence	1
over	1
scientific	1
studies	1
the	1
natural	1
sciences	1
have	1
just	1
as	1
great	1
an	1
educational	1
value	1
put	1
in	1
pestsov	1
take	1
astronomy	1
take	1
botany	1
or	1
zoology	1
with	1
its	1
system	1
of	1
general	1
principles	1
i	1
cannot	1
quite	1
agree	1
with	1
that	1
responded	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
process	1
of	1
studying	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
language	1
has	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
favorable	1
influence	1
on	1
intellectual	1
development	1
moreover	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
denied	1
that	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
classical	1
authors	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
moral	1
while	1
unfortunately	1
with	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
sciences	1
are	1
associated	1
the	1
false	1
and	1
noxious	1
doctrines	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
our	1
day	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
something	1
but	1
pestsov	1
interrupted	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
rich	1
bass	1
he	1
began	1
warmly	1
contesting	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
this	1
view	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
waited	1
serenely	1
to	1
speak	1
obviously	1
with	1
a	1
convincing	1
reply	1
ready	1
but	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
smiling	1
subtly	1
and	1
addressing	1
karenin	1
one	1
must	1
allow	1
that	1
to	1
weigh	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
classical	1
and	1
scientific	1
studies	1
is	1
a	1
difficult	1
task	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
form	1
of	1
education	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
preferred	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
quickly	1
and	1
conclusively	1
decided	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
classical	1
education	1
as	1
you	1
expressed	1
it	1
just	1
now	1
its	1
moral	1
disons	1
le	1
mot	1
anti	1
nihilist	1
influence	1
undoubtedly	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
distinctive	1
property	1
of	1
anti	1
nihilistic	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
classical	1
studies	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
considered	1
the	1
subject	1
more	1
have	1
weighed	1
the	1
arguments	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
elbow	1
room	1
to	1
both	1
tendencies	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
little	1
pills	1
of	1
classical	1
learning	1
possess	1
the	1
medicinal	1
property	1
of	1
anti	1
nihilism	1
and	1
we	1
boldly	1
prescribe	1
them	1
to	1
our	1
patients	1
but	1
what	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
such	1
medicinal	1
property	1
he	1
wound	1
up	1
humorously	1
at	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
little	1
pills	1
everyone	1
laughed	1
turovtsin	1
in	1
especial	1
roared	1
loudly	1
and	1
jovially	1
glad	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
something	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
ever	1
looked	1
for	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
conversation	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
inviting	1
pestsov	1
with	1
pestsov	1
intellectual	1
conversation	1
never	1
flagged	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
directly	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
had	1
concluded	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
jest	1
pestsov	1
promptly	1
started	1
a	1
new	1
one	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
agree	1
even	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
had	1
that	1
aim	1
the	1
government	1
obviously	1
is	1
guided	1
by	1
abstract	1
considerations	1
and	1
remains	1
indifferent	1
to	1
the	1
influence	1
its	1
measures	1
may	1
exercise	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
women	1
for	1
instance	1
would	1
naturally	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
harmful	1
but	1
the	1
government	1
opens	1
schools	1
and	1
universities	1
for	1
women	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
at	1
once	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
women	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
expressed	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
women	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
confounded	1
with	1
the	1
emancipation	1
of	1
women	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
considered	1
dangerous	1
i	1
consider	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
questions	1
are	1
inseparably	1
connected	1
together	1
said	1
pestsov	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
vicious	1
circle	1
woman	1
is	1
deprived	1
of	1
rights	1
from	1
lack	1
of	1
education	1
and	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
education	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
rights	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
forget	1
that	1
the	1
subjection	1
of	1
women	1
is	1
so	1
complete	1
and	1
dates	1
from	1
such	1
ages	1
back	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
often	1
unwilling	1
to	1
recognize	1
the	1
gulf	1
that	1
separates	1
them	1
from	1
us	1
said	1
he	1
you	1
said	1
rights	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
waiting	1
till	1
pestsov	1
had	1
finished	1
meaning	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
sitting	1
on	1
juries	1
of	1
voting	1
of	1
presiding	1
at	1
official	1
meetings	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
entering	1
the	1
civil	1
service	1
of	1
sitting	1
in	1
parliament	1
undoubtedly	1
but	1
if	1
women	1
as	1
a	1
rare	1
exception	1
can	1
occupy	1
such	1
positions	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
are	1
wrong	1
in	1
using	1
the	1
expression	1
rights	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
correct	1
to	1
say	1
duties	1
every	1
man	1
will	1
agree	1
that	1
in	1
doing	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
a	1
juryman	1
a	1
witness	1
a	1
telegraph	1
clerk	1
we	1
feel	1
we	1
are	1
performing	1
duties	1
and	1
therefore	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
correct	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
women	1
are	1
seeking	1
duties	1
and	1
quite	1
legitimately	1
and	1
one	1
can	1
but	1
sympathize	1
with	1
this	1
desire	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
labor	1
of	1
man	1
quite	1
so	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
assented	1
the	1
question	1
i	1
imagine	1
is	1
simply	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
fitted	1
for	1
such	1
duties	1
they	1
will	1
most	1
likely	1
be	1
perfectly	1
fitted	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
when	1
education	1
has	1
become	1
general	1
among	1
them	1
we	1
see	1
this	1
how	1
about	1
the	1
proverb	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
been	1
intent	1
on	1
the	1
conversation	1
his	1
little	1
comical	1
eyes	1
twinkling	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
it	1
before	1
my	1
daughter	1
her	1
hair	1
is	1
long	1
because	1
her	1
wit	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
before	1
their	1
emancipation	1
said	1
pestsov	1
angrily	1
what	1
seems	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
that	1
women	1
should	1
seek	1
fresh	1
duties	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
while	1
we	1
see	1
unhappily	1
that	1
men	1
usually	1
try	1
to	1
avoid	1
them	1
duties	1
are	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
rights	1
power	1
money	1
honor	1
those	1
are	1
what	1
women	1
are	1
seeking	1
said	1
pestsov	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
i	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
wet	1
nurse	1
and	1
feel	1
injured	1
because	1
women	1
are	1
paid	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
while	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
take	1
me	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
turovtsin	1
exploded	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
roar	1
of	1
laughter	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
regretted	1

everyone	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
except	1
kitty	1
and	1
levin	1
at	1
first	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
influence	1
that	1
one	1
people	1
has	1
on	1
another	1
there	1
rose	1
to	1
levin	1
s	1
mind	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
these	1
ideas	1
once	1
of	1
such	1
importance	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
brain	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
had	1
now	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
interest	1
for	1
him	1
it	1
even	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
strange	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
eager	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
anyone	1
kitty	1
too	1
should	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
supposed	1
have	1
been	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
education	1
of	1
women	1
how	1
often	1
she	1
had	1
mused	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
friend	1
abroad	1
varenka	1
of	1
her	1
painful	1
state	1
of	1
dependence	1
how	1
often	1
she	1
had	1
wondered	1
about	1
herself	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
marry	1
and	1
how	1
often	1
she	1
had	1
argued	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
about	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
she	1
and	1
levin	1
had	1
a	1
conversation	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
yet	1
not	1
a	1
conversation	1
but	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
mysterious	1
communication	1
which	1
brought	1
them	1
every	1
moment	1
nearer	1
and	1
stirred	1
in	1
both	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
glad	1
terror	1
before	1
the	1
unknown	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
entering	1
at	1
first	1
levin	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
kitty	1
s	1
question	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
last	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
coming	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
mowing	1
along	1
the	1
highroad	1
and	1
had	1
met	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
you	1
were	1
probably	1
only	1
just	1
awake	1
your	1
mother	1
was	1
asleep	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
exquisite	1
morning	1
i	1
was	1
walking	1
along	1
wondering	1
who	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
four	1
in	1
hand	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
splendid	1
set	1
of	1
four	1
horses	1
with	1
bells	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
second	1
you	1
flashed	1
by	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
you	1
were	1
sitting	1
like	1
this	1
holding	1
the	1
strings	1
of	1
your	1
cap	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
thinking	1
awfully	1
deeply	1
about	1
something	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
how	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
thinking	1
about	1
then	1
something	1
important	1
wasn	1
t	1
i	1
dreadfully	1
untidy	1
she	1
wondered	1
but	1
seeing	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
ecstasy	1
these	1
reminiscences	1
called	1
up	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
impression	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
good	1
she	1
blushed	1
and	1
laughed	1
with	1
delight	1
really	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
remember	1
how	1
nicely	1
turovtsin	1
laughs	1
said	1
levin	1
admiring	1
his	1
moist	1
eyes	1
and	1
shaking	1
chest	1
have	1
you	1
known	1
him	1
long	1
asked	1
kitty	1
oh	1
everyone	1
knows	1
him	1
and	1
i	1
see	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
horrid	1
man	1
not	1
horrid	1
but	1
nothing	1
in	1
him	1
oh	1
you	1
re	1
wrong	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
give	1
up	1
thinking	1
so	1
directly	1
said	1
kitty	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
too	1
but	1
he	1
he	1
s	1
an	1
awfully	1
nice	1
and	1
wonderfully	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
gold	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
heart	1
he	1
has	1
we	1
are	1
great	1
friends	1
i	1
know	1
him	1
very	1
well	1
last	1
winter	1
soon	1
after	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
guilty	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
confiding	1
smile	1
all	1
dolly	1
s	1
children	1
had	1
scarlet	1
fever	1
and	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
only	1
fancy	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
he	1
felt	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
stayed	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
children	1
yes	1
and	1
for	1
three	1
weeks	1
he	1
stopped	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
looked	1
after	1
the	1
children	1
like	1
a	1
nurse	1
i	1
am	1
telling	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
about	1
turovtsin	1
in	1
the	1
scarlet	1
fever	1
she	1
said	1
bending	1
over	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
yes	1
it	1
was	1
wonderful	1
noble	1
said	1
dolly	1
glancing	1
towards	1
turovtsin	1
who	1
had	1
become	1
aware	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
smiling	1
gently	1
to	1
him	1
levin	1
glanced	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
turovtsin	1
and	1
wondered	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
realized	1
all	1
this	1
man	1
s	1
goodness	1
before	1
i	1
m	1
sorry	1
i	1
m	1
sorry	1
and	1
i	1
ll	1
never	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
people	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
gaily	1
genuinely	1
expressing	1
what	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
chapter	1
12	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
women	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
inequality	1
of	1
rights	1
in	1
marriage	1
improper	1
to	1
discuss	1
before	1
the	1
ladies	1
pestsov	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
during	1
dinner	1
touched	1
upon	1
these	1
questions	1
but	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
carefully	1
drew	1
him	1
off	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
pestsov	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
them	1
but	1
addressing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
began	1
to	1
expound	1
the	1
chief	1
ground	1
of	1
inequality	1
the	1
inequality	1
in	1
marriage	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
infidelity	1
of	1
the	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
infidelity	1
of	1
the	1
husband	1
are	1
punished	1
unequally	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
by	1
public	1
opinion	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
went	1
hurriedly	1
up	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
cigar	1
no	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
smoke	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
answered	1
calmly	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
purposely	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
pestsov	1
with	1
a	1
chilly	1
smile	1
i	1
imagine	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
view	1
has	1
a	1
foundation	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
nature	1
of	1
things	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
turovtsin	1
broke	1
suddenly	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
addressing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
you	1
heard	1
perhaps	1
about	1
pryatchnikov	1
said	1
turovtsin	1
warmed	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
champagne	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
and	1
long	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
had	1
weighed	1
on	1
him	1
vasya	1
pryatchnikov	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
damp	1
red	1
lips	1
addressing	1
himself	1
principally	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
guest	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
today	1
he	1
fought	1
a	1
duel	1
with	1
kvitsky	1
at	1
tver	1
and	1
has	1
killed	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
seems	1
that	1
one	1
bruises	1
oneself	1
on	1
a	1
sore	1
place	1
so	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
would	1
by	1
ill	1
luck	1
fall	1
every	1
moment	1
on	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
sore	1
spot	1
he	1
would	1
again	1
have	1
got	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
away	1
but	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
himself	1
inquired	1
with	1
curiosity	1
what	1
did	1
pryatchnikov	1
fight	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
acted	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
did	1
called	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
shot	1
him	1
ah	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
indifferently	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
dolly	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
smile	1
meeting	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
outer	1
drawing	1
room	1
i	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
let	1
s	1
sit	1
here	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
indifference	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
lifted	1
eyebrows	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
and	1
smiled	1
affectedly	1
it	1
s	1
fortunate	1
said	1
he	1
especially	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
meaning	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
excuse	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
taking	1
leave	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
start	1
tomorrow	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
innocence	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
growing	1
pale	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
quivering	1
with	1
anger	1
at	1
this	1
frigid	1
unfeeling	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
calmly	1
intending	1
to	1
ruin	1
her	1
innocent	1
friend	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
desperate	1
resolution	1
looking	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
i	1
asked	1
you	1
about	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
frowned	1
and	1
almost	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
dropped	1
his	1
head	1
i	1
presume	1
that	1
your	1
husband	1
has	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
grounds	1
on	1

it	1
necessary	1
to	1

said	1

before	1

with	1
a	1

rose	1

got	1
up	1
and	1
submissively	1
followed	1

down	1

of	1
that	1

when	1
they	1
rose	1
from	1

levin	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
follow	1
kitty	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
she	1
might	1
dislike	1
this	1
as	1
too	1
obviously	1
paying	1
her	1
attention	1
he	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
ring	1
of	1
men	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
kitty	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
her	1
looks	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
smallest	1
effort	1
keep	1
the	1
promise	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
always	1
to	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
and	1
to	1
like	1
everyone	1
always	1
the	1
conversation	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
village	1
commune	1
in	1
which	1
pestsov	1
saw	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
special	1
principle	1
called	1
by	1
him	1
the	1
choral	1
principle	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
pestsov	1
nor	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
special	1
attitude	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
both	1
admitting	1
and	1
not	1
admitting	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
commune	1
but	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
them	1
simply	1
trying	1
to	1
reconcile	1
and	1
soften	1
their	1
differences	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
himself	1
and	1
even	1
less	1
so	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
and	1
everyone	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
contented	1
he	1
knew	1
now	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
of	1
importance	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
thing	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
moving	1
across	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
turning	1
round	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
turning	1
round	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
with	1
shtcherbatsky	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
i	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
towards	1
the	1

going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
that	1

something	1

no	1
we	1
only	1
came	1
to	1
fetch	1
you	1
and	1
thank	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
rewarding	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
was	1

a	1
gift	1
for	1
coming	1
what	1

anyone	1
you	1
know	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
said	1
levin	1
it	1
generally	1
happens	1
that	1
one	1
argues	1
warmly	1
simply	1
because	1
one	1
can	1

make	1
out	1
what	1
one	1
s	1
opponent	1
wants	1
to	1
prove	1
levin	1
had	1
often	1
noticed	1
in	1
discussions	1
between	1
the	1
most	1
intelligent	1
people	1
that	1
after	1
enormous	1
efforts	1
and	1
an	1
enormous	1
expenditure	1
of	1
logical	1
subtleties	1
and	1
words	1
the	1
disputants	1
finally	1
arrived	1
at	1
being	1
aware	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
struggling	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
argument	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
both	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
liked	1
different	1
things	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
define	1
what	1
they	1
liked	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
attacked	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
had	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
suddenly	1
in	1
a	1
discussion	1
grasping	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
opponent	1
liked	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
liking	1
it	1
too	1
and	1
immediately	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
agreeing	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
arguments	1
fell	1
away	1
as	1
useless	1
sometimes	1
too	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
the	1
opposite	1
expressing	1
at	1
last	1
what	1
he	1
liked	1
himself	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
devising	1
arguments	1
to	1
defend	1
and	1
chancing	1
to	1
express	1
it	1
well	1
and	1
genuinely	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
his	1
opponent	1
at	1
once	1
agreeing	1
and	1
ceasing	1
to	1
dispute	1
his	1
position	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
she	1
knitted	1
her	1
brow	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
but	1
directly	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
illustrate	1
his	1
meaning	1
she	1
understood	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
know	1
one	1
must	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
arguing	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
precious	1
to	1
him	1
then	1
one	1
can	1
she	1
had	1
completely	1
guessed	1
and	1
expressed	1
his	1
badly	1
expressed	1
idea	1
levin	1
smiled	1
joyfully	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
this	1
transition	1
from	1
the	1
confused	1
verbose	1
discussion	1
with	1
pestsov	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
this	1
laconic	1
clear	1
almost	1
wordless	1
communication	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
complex	1
ideas	1
shtcherbatsky	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
kitty	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
card	1
table	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1

circles	1
over	1

again	1
on	1

not	1

should	1
find	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
duties	1
in	1
a	1
family	1
he	1
supported	1
this	1
view	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
no	1
family	1
can	1
get	1
on	1
without	1
women	1
to	1
help	1
that	1

said	1
kitty	1
blushing	1
but	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
boldly	1
with	1
her	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
a	1
girl	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
circumstanced	1
that	1
she	1

in	1
the	1

without	1
humiliation	1
while	1
she	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
hint	1
he	1
understood	1

oh	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
yes	1
yes	1
yes	1
you	1
re	1
right	1
you	1
re	1
right	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
pestsov	1
had	1
been	1
maintaining	1
at	1
dinner	1
of	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
woman	1
simply	1
from	1
getting	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
maid	1
s	1
existence	1
and	1
its	1
humiliation	1
in	1
kitty	1
s	1
heart	1
and	1
loving	1
her	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
terror	1
and	1
humiliation	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
up	1
his	1
arguments	1
a	1
silence	1
followed	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
drawing	1
with	1
the	1
chalk	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
shining	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
light	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
her	1
mood	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
continually	1
growing	1
tension	1
of	1
happiness	1
ah	1
i	1
ve	1
scribbled	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
laying	1
down	1
the	1
chalk	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
what	1
shall	1
i	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
without	1
her	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
chalk	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
i	1
ve	1
long	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
her	1
caressing	1
though	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
please	1
ask	1
it	1
here	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1

the	1

that	1
mean	1
never	1
or	1
then	1
there	1
seemed	1
no	1
likelihood	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
this	1
complicated	1
sentence	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
his	1
life	1
depended	1
on	1
her	1
understanding	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
seriously	1
then	1
leaned	1
her	1
puckered	1
brow	1
on	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
she	1
stole	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
asking	1
him	1
is	1
it	1
what	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
understand	1
she	1
said	1
flushing	1
a	1
little	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
word	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
n	1
that	1
stood	1
for	1
never	1
it	1
means	1
never	1

said	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
true	1
he	1
quickly	1
rubbed	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
chalk	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
she	1
wrote	1

dolly	1
was	1
completely	1
comforted	1
in	1
the	1
depression	1
caused	1
by	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
when	1
she	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
figures	1
kitty	1
with	1
the	1
chalk	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
shy	1
and	1
happy	1
smile	1
looking	1
upwards	1
at	1
levin	1
and	1
his	1
handsome	1
figure	1
bending	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
glowing	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
one	1
minute	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
on	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
suddenly	1
radiant	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
it	1
meant	1
then	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
differently	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
questioningly	1
timidly	1
only	1
then	1
yes	1
her	1
smile	1
answered	1
and	1
n	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
asked	1
well	1

i	1

you	1
what	1
i	1
should	1

	1
this	1
meant	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
forget	1
and	1
forgive	1
what	1
happened	1
he	1
snatched	1
the	1
chalk	1
with	1
nervous	1
trembling	1
fingers	1
and	1
breaking	1
it	1
wrote	1
the	1
initial	1
letters	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
phrase	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
forget	1
and	1
to	1
forgive	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
you	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
waver	1
i	1
understand	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
wrote	1
a	1
long	1
phrase	1
she	1
understood	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
without	1
asking	1
him	1
is	1
it	1
this	1
took	1
the	1
chalk	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
answered	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
and	1
often	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
he	1
was	1
stupefied	1
with	1
happiness	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
supply	1
the	1
word	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
charming	1
eyes	1
beaming	1
with	1
happiness	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
he	1
needed	1
to	1
know	1
and	1
he	1
wrote	1
three	1
letters	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
finished	1
writing	1
when	1
she	1
read	1
them	1
over	1
her	1
arm	1
and	1
herself	1
finished	1
and	1
wrote	1
the	1
answer	1
yes	1
you	1
re	1
playing	1
secrétaire	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
really	1
be	1
getting	1
along	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
theater	1

got	1
up	1
and	1
escorted	1
kitty	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
their	1
conversation	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
it	1
had	1
been	1

that	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
tomorrow	1
morning	1
chapter	1
14	1
when	1
kitty	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
levin	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
he	1
felt	1
such	1
uneasiness	1
without	1
her	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
impatient	1
longing	1
to	1
get	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
tomorrow	1
morning	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
her	1
again	1
and	1
be	1
plighted	1
to	1
her	1
forever	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
afraid	1
as	1
though	1
of	1
death	1
of	1
those	1
fourteen	1
hours	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
without	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
essential	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
someone	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1

most	1
congenial	1
to	1
him	1

he	1
was	1
going	1
out	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
a	1
soirée	1
in	1
reality	1
to	1
the	1
ballet	1
levin	1
only	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
never	1
never	1
forget	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
showed	1
levin	1
that	1
he	1
comprehended	1
that	1
feeling	1
fittingly	1
oh	1
so	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
time	1
to	1

of	1
congratulation	1

of	1

she	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
how	1
lofty	1

beyond	1
her	1

levin	1
clutching	1
at	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
muffling	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
it	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
nice	1
girl	1
were	1
such	1
simple	1
humble	1
words	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
harmony	1
with	1
his	1
feeling	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
laughed	1
outright	1
a	1
merry	1
laugh	1
which	1
was	1
rare	1
with	1
him	1
well	1
anyway	1
i	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
very	1

he	1
added	1
i	1
do	1
like	1
you	1
so	1
well	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
discussion	1
about	1
today	1
asked	1
levin	1
never	1
ceasing	1
smiling	1
they	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
levin	1
heard	1
the	1
secretary	1
hesitatingly	1
read	1
the	1
minutes	1
which	1
he	1
obviously	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
understand	1
but	1
levin	1
saw	1
from	1
this	1
secretary	1
s	1
face	1
what	1
a	1
good	1
nice	1
kind	1
hearted	1
person	1
he	1
was	1
this	1
was	1
evident	1
from	1
his	1
confusion	1
and	1
embarrassment	1
in	1
reading	1
the	1
minutes	1
then	1
the	1
discussion	1
began	1
they	1
were	1
disputing	1
about	1
the	1
misappropriation	1
of	1
certain	1
sums	1
and	1
the	1
laying	1
of	1
certain	1
pipes	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
very	1
cutting	1
to	1
two	1
members	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
at	1
great	1
length	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
triumph	1
and	1
another	1
member	1
scribbling	1
something	1
on	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
paper	1
began	1
timidly	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
afterwards	1
answered	1
him	1
very	1
viciously	1
and	1
delightfully	1
and	1
then	1
sviazhsky	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
too	1
said	1
something	1
too	1
very	1
handsomely	1
and	1
nobly	1
levin	1
listened	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
these	1
missing	1
sums	1
and	1
these	1
pipes	1
were	1
not	1
anything	1
real	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
angry	1
but	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
nicest	1
kindest	1
people	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
as	1
happy	1
and	1
charming	1
as	1
possible	1
among	1
them	1
they	1
did	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
enjoying	1
it	1
what	1
struck	1
levin	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
through	1
them	1
all	1
today	1
and	1
from	1
little	1
almost	1
imperceptible	1
signs	1
knew	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
each	1
and	1
saw	1
distinctly	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
good	1
at	1
heart	1
and	1
levin	1
himself	1
in	1
particular	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
was	1
evident	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
friendly	1
affectionate	1
way	1
even	1
those	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
well	1
did	1
you	1
like	1
it	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
asked	1
him	1
very	1
much	1
i	1
never	1
supposed	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
interesting	1
capital	1
splendid	1
sviazhsky	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
levin	1
and	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
tea	1
with	1
him	1
levin	1
was	1
utterly	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
comprehend	1
or	1
recall	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
had	1
disliked	1
in	1
sviazhsky	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
failed	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
clever	1
and	1
wonderfully	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
most	1
delighted	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
asked	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
queer	1
association	1
of	1
ideas	1
because	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
connected	1
with	1
marriage	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
more	1
suitably	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
them	1
sviazhsky	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
improvements	1
on	1
his	1
estate	1
presupposing	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
not	1
done	1
already	1
in	1
europe	1
and	1
now	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
annoy	1
levin	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
right	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
was	1
of	1
little	1
value	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
wonderful	1
softness	1
and	1
consideration	1
with	1
which	1
sviazhsky	1
avoided	1
fully	1
expressing	1
his	1
correct	1
view	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
sviazhsky	1
household	1
were	1
particularly	1
delightful	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
already	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
him	1
saying	1
nothing	1
merely	1
from	1
delicacy	1
he	1
stayed	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
hour	1
two	1
three	1
talking	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
subjects	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
observe	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
boring	1
them	1
dreadfully	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
past	1
their	1
bedtime	1
sviazhsky	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
yawning	1
and	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
humor	1
his	1
friend	1
was	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
past	1
one	1
o	1
clock	1
levin	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
hotel	1
and	1
was	1
dismayed	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
all	1
alone	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
impatience	1
he	1
had	1
ten	1
hours	1
still	1
left	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
the	1
servant	1
whose	1
turn	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
up	1
all	1
night	1
lighted	1
his	1
candles	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
away	1
but	1
levin	1
stopped	1
him	1
this	1
servant	1
yegor	1
whom	1
levin	1
had	1
noticed	1
before	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
intelligent	1
excellent	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
good	1

then	1
here	1
one	1
makes	1

it	1
appeared	1
that	1
yegor	1
had	1
a	1
family	1
three	1
boys	1
and	1
a	1
daughter	1
a	1
sempstress	1
whom	1
he	1

to	1
a	1
cashier	1
in	1
a	1

levin	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
informed	1
yegor	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
in	1

the	1
great	1

was	1

that	1

only	1
on	1
oneself	1
yegor	1
listened	1
attentively	1
and	1
obviously	1
quite	1
took	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
idea	1
but	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
assent	1
to	1
it	1
he	1
enunciated	1
greatly	1
to	1
levin	1
s	1
surprise	1
the	1
observation	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
good	1
masters	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
masters	1
and	1
now	1
was	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
employer	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
frenchman	1
wonderfully	1
good	1
hearted	1
fellow	1
thought	1
levin	1
well	1
but	1
you	1
yourself	1
yegor	1
when	1
you	1
got	1
married	1
did	1
you	1
love	1
your	1
wife	1
ay	1
and	1
why	1
not	1
responded	1
yegor	1
and	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
yegor	1
too	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
excited	1
state	1
and	1
intending	1
to	1
express	1
all	1
his	1
most	1
heartfelt	1
emotions	1
my	1
life	1
too	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
wonderful	1
one	1
from	1
a	1
child	1
up	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
with	1
flashing	1
eyes	1
apparently	1
catching	1
levin	1
s	1
enthusiasm	1
just	1
as	1
people	1
catch	1
yawning	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
ring	1
was	1
heard	1
yegor	1
departed	1
and	1
levin	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
scarcely	1
anything	1
at	1
dinner	1
had	1
refused	1
tea	1
and	1
supper	1
at	1

opened	1
both	1
the	1

sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1

over	1
the	1

drank	1
in	1
the	1

freezing	1

flowed	1
evenly	1
into	1
the	1

and	1
followed	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
the	1
images	1
and	1
memories	1
that	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
at	1

heard	1

peeped	1
out	1

walked	1
gloomily	1
frowning	1
and	1
coughing	1
poor	1
unlucky	1

thought	1
levin	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
love	1
and	1
pity	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
talked	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
him	1
but	1
remembering	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
shirt	1
on	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
pane	1
to	1
bathe	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
air	1
and	1
gaze	1
at	1
the	1
exquisite	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
silent	1
but	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
mounting	1
lurid	1
yellow	1
star	1
at	1
seven	1

there	1
was	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
people	1
polishing	1
the	1
floors	1
and	1
bells	1
ringing	1
in	1
some	1
servants	1

and	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
get	1
frozen	1

closed	1
the	1

washed	1
dressed	1

went	1
out	1
into	1

everything	1

walked	1
back	1
went	1
into	1

asked	1
for	1
coffee	1
the	1

not	1
yegor	1

brought	1
it	1
to	1

a	1

rang	1
for	1
the	1

went	1
out	1
levin	1
tried	1
to	1
drink	1
coffee	1
and	1
put	1
some	1
roll	1
in	1
his	1

his	1

was	1
quite	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
roll	1
levin	1
rejecting	1
the	1

put	1
on	1

all	1
that	1
night	1

morning	1
levin	1
lived	1

lifted	1
out	1
of	1

spent	1
several	1
hours	1
undressed	1
in	1
the	1

and	1
felt	1
not	1
simply	1
fresher	1
and	1
stronger	1
than	1
ever	1
but	1
felt	1
utterly	1
independent	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
he	1
moved	1
without	1
muscular	1
effort	1
and	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
anything	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
he	1
could	1
fly	1
upwards	1

in	1

incessantly	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1

down	1

all	1
happened	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
a	1
boy	1
ran	1
towards	1
a	1
dove	1
and	1
glanced	1
smiling	1
at	1
levin	1
the	1
dove	1
with	1
a	1
whir	1
of	1
her	1
wings	1
darted	1
away	1
flashing	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
amid	1
grains	1
of	1
snow	1
that	1
quivered	1
in	1
the	1

from	1
a	1

window	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1

the	1

were	1
put	1
out	1

this	1
together	1
was	1
so	1
extraordinarily	1
nice	1
that	1

delight	1
going	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
round	1
by	1

putting	1

sat	1
down	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
twelve	1

out	1
onto	1
the	1

drivers	1
clearly	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
they	1
crowded	1
round	1
levin	1
with	1
happy	1
faces	1
quarreling	1
among	1
themselves	1
and	1
offering	1
their	1
services	1
trying	1
not	1

the	1

promising	1
to	1

told	1
him	1
to	1

never	1

drew	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
with	1
a	1
curve	1
of	1
his	1

a	1

certainly	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
this	1
was	1
evident	1
from	1
the	1
smile	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1

the	1
way	1

heard	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1

at	1
the	1

mademoiselle	1

vanished	1
from	1

over	1
him	1
at	1

so	1
quickly	1
approaching	1
him	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
walk	1
but	1
seemed	1
by	1
some	1
unseen	1
force	1
to	1
float	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
clear	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
frightened	1
by	1
the	1

bliss	1
of	1
love	1
that	1
flooded	1
his	1
heart	1
those	1
eyes	1
were	1
shining	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
blinding	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
light	1
of	1
love	1
she	1
stopped	1
still	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
touching	1
him	1
her	1
hands	1
rose	1
and	1
dropped	1
onto	1

all	1
she	1
could	1
she	1
had	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
given	1
herself	1
up	1
entirely	1
shy	1
and	1
happy	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
her	1
mouth	1
that	1
sought	1
his	1
kiss	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
not	1
slept	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
expecting	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
father	1
had	1
consented	1
without	1
demur	1
and	1
were	1
happy	1
in	1
her	1
happiness	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1

to	1
tell	1
him	1
her	1
happiness	1

his	1
she	1
had	1
got	1
ready	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
alone	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
delighted	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
shy	1
and	1
ashamed	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
herself	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
steps	1

at	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
mademoiselle	1

without	1
asking	1
herself	1
how	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
mamma	1
she	1
said	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
desecrating	1
the	1
loftiness	1
of	1
his	1
emotion	1
by	1
a	1
word	1
as	1
that	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
instead	1
of	1
words	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
tears	1
of	1
happiness	1
were	1
welling	1
up	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1

be	1
true	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
choked	1
voice	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
believe	1
you	1
love	1
me	1

she	1
smiled	1
at	1
that	1
dear	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
timidity	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
yes	1
she	1
said	1
significantly	1
deliberately	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
happy	1
not	1

up	1
to	1

with	1

the	1

there	1
came	1
over	1

a	1

not	1
in	1

disturbed	1

what	1

went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1

him	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
away	1
but	1
he	1
kept	1
her	1
embraced	1
her	1
and	1
tenderly	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
lover	1
kissed	1
her	1
several	1

the	1

muddled	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1

know	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
love	1
again	1
or	1
their	1
daughter	1
when	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
gone	1
levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
betrothed	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
was	1
self	1
possessed	1
now	1
and	1
could	1
speak	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
i	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
i	1
never	1
hoped	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
was	1
always	1
sure	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
ordained	1
and	1
i	1
she	1
said	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
stopped	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
again	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
resolutely	1
with	1
her	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
even	1
when	1
i	1
thrust	1
from	1
me	1
my	1
happiness	1
i	1
always	1
loved	1
you	1
alone	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
can	1
you	1
forgive	1
that	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
best	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
this	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
he	1
had	1
resolved	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
two	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
chaste	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
believer	1
it	1
was	1
agonizing	1
but	1
he	1
considered	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
both	1
these	1
facts	1
no	1
not	1
now	1
later	1
he	1
said	1
very	1
well	1
later	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
certainly	1
tell	1
me	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
anything	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
everything	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
settled	1
he	1
added	1
settled	1
that	1
you	1
ll	1
take	1
me	1
whatever	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
give	1
me	1
up	1

their	1
conversation	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
mademoiselle	1
linon	1
who	1
with	1
an	1
affected	1
but	1
tender	1
smile	1
came	1
to	1
congratulate	1
her	1
favorite	1
pupil	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
the	1
servants	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
their	1
congratulations	1
then	1
relations	1
arrived	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
blissful	1
absurdity	1
from	1
which	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
emerge	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
wedding	1
levin	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
continual	1
state	1
of	1
awkwardness	1
and	1
discomfort	1
but	1
the	1
intensity	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
went	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
increasing	1
he	1
felt	1
continually	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
was	1
being	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
everything	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
and	1
it	1
all	1
gave	1
him	1
happiness	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
his	1
engagement	1
would	1
have	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
like	1
others	1
that	1
the	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
engaged	1
couples	1
would	1
spoil	1
his	1
special	1
happiness	1
but	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
his	1
doing	1
exactly	1
as	1
other	1
people	1
did	1
and	1
his	1
happiness	1
being	1
only	1
increased	1
thereby	1
and	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
special	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
unlike	1
anything	1
that	1
had	1
ever	1
happened	1
now	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
sweetmeats	1
to	1
eat	1
said	1
mademoiselle	1
linon	1
and	1
levin	1
drove	1
off	1
to	1
buy	1
sweetmeats	1
well	1
i	1

you	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
bouquets	1
from	1
fomin	1
s	1
oh	1
are	1
they	1
wanted	1
and	1
he	1
drove	1
to	1
fomin	1
s	1
his	1
brother	1
offered	1
to	1
lend	1
him	1
money	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
so	1
many	1
expenses	1
presents	1
to	1
give	1
oh	1
are	1

wanted	1
and	1
he	1
galloped	1
to	1
foulde	1

and	1
at	1
the	1
confectioner	1
s	1
and	1
at	1
fomin	1
s	1
and	1
at	1
foulde	1
s	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
expected	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
prided	1
themselves	1
on	1
his	1
happiness	1
just	1
as	1
everyone	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
during	1
those	1
days	1
what	1
was	1
extraordinary	1
was	1
that	1
everyone	1
not	1
only	1
liked	1
him	1
but	1
even	1
people	1
previously	1
unsympathetic	1
cold	1
and	1
callous	1
were	1
enthusiastic	1
over	1
him	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
everything	1
treated	1
his	1
feeling	1
with	1
tenderness	1
and	1
delicacy	1
and	1
shared	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
happiest	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
because	1
his	1
betrothed	1
was	1
beyond	1
perfection	1
kitty	1
too	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
when	1
countess	1
nordston	1
ventured	1
to	1
hint	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
hoped	1
for	1
something	1
better	1
kitty	1
was	1
so	1
angry	1
and	1
proved	1
so	1
conclusively	1
that	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
levin	1
that	1
countess	1
nordston	1
had	1
to	1
admit	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
kitty	1
s	1
presence	1
never	1
met	1
levin	1
without	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
ecstatic	1
admiration	1
the	1
confession	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
painful	1
incident	1
of	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
consulted	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
sanction	1
gave	1
kitty	1
his	1
diary	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
written	1
the	1
confession	1
that	1
tortured	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
this	1
diary	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
his	1
future	1
wife	1
two	1
things	1
caused	1
him	1
anguish	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
purity	1
and	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
faith	1
his	1
confession	1
of	1
unbelief	1
passed	1
unnoticed	1
she	1
was	1
religious	1
had	1
never	1
doubted	1
the	1
truths	1
of	1
religion	1
but	1
his	1
external	1
unbelief	1
did	1
not	1
affect	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
through	1
love	1
she	1
knew	1
all	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
she	1
saw	1
what	1
she	1
wanted	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
soul	1
should	1

her	1
his	1

her	1
there	1
could	1
not	1

and	1
should	1
not	1

secrets	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
that	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
realized	1
what	1

effect	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
on	1

put	1
himself	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
same	1
evening	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
their	1
house	1
before	1
the	1
theater	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
tear	1
stained	1
pitiful	1
sweet	1
face	1
miserable	1
with	1
suffering	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
undo	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
abyss	1
that	1
separated	1
his	1
shameful	1
past	1
from	1
her	1
dovelike	1
purity	1
and	1
was	1
appalled	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
take	1
them	1
take	1
these	1
dreadful	1
books	1
she	1
said	1
pushing	1
away	1
the	1
notebooks	1
lying	1
before	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
give	1
them	1
me	1
no	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
anyway	1
she	1
added	1
touched	1
by	1
his	1
despairing	1
face	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
awful	1
his	1
head	1
sank	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
me	1
he	1
whispered	1
yes	1
i	1
forgive	1
you	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
terrible	1
but	1
his	1
happiness	1
was	1
so	1
immense	1
that	1
this	1
confession	1
did	1
not	1
shatter	1
it	1
it	1
only	1
added	1
another	1
shade	1
to	1
it	1
she	1
forgave	1
him	1
but	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
unworthy	1
of	1
her	1
morally	1
bowed	1
down	1
lower	1
than	1

before	1

of	1
the	1

his	1

this	1

by	1
alexey	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1

what	1

this	1

the	1

went	1
into	1

ordered	1

taking	1

began	1

two	1
telegrams	1

i	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
your	1
excellency	1

d	1
only	1
just	1
that	1
minute	1
gone	1
out	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
took	1
the	1
telegrams	1
and	1
opened	1
them	1
the	1
first	1
telegram	1
was	1
the	1
announcement	1
of	1
stremov	1
s	1
appointment	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
post	1

had	1
coveted	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
flung	1
the	1
telegram	1
down	1
and	1

up	1

down	1
the	1

he	1
said	1
meaning	1
by	1
quos	1
the	1
persons	1
responsible	1
for	1
this	1
appointment	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
annoyed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
received	1
the	1
post	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
conspicuously	1
passed	1
over	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
incomprehensible	1
amazing	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
wordy	1
phrase	1
monger	1
stremov	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
man	1
fit	1
for	1
it	1
how	1
could	1
they	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
ruining	1
themselves	1
lowering	1
their	1
prestige	1
by	1
this	1
appointment	1
something	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
line	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
bitterly	1
opening	1
the	1
second	1
telegram	1
the	1
telegram	1
was	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
her	1
name	1
written	1
in	1
blue	1
pencil	1
anna	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
caught	1
his	1
eye	1
i	1
am	1
dying	1
i	1
beg	1
i	1
implore	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
i	1
shall	1
die	1
easier	1
with	1
your	1
forgiveness	1
he	1
read	1
he	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
flung	1
down	1
the	1
telegram	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
trick	1
and	1
a	1
fraud	1
of	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
deceit	1
she	1
would	1
stick	1
at	1
she	1
was	1
near	1
her	1
confinement	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
confinement	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
their	1
aim	1
to	1
legitimize	1
the	1
child	1
to	1
compromise	1
me	1
and	1
prevent	1
a	1
divorce	1
he	1
thought	1
but	1
something	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
it	1
i	1
am	1
dying	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
telegram	1
again	1
and	1
suddenly	1
the	1
plain	1
meaning	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
it	1
struck	1
him	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
agony	1
and	1
nearness	1
to	1
death	1
she	1
is	1
genuinely	1
penitent	1
and	1
i	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
trick	1
refuse	1
to	1
go	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
be	1
cruel	1
and	1
everyone	1
would	1
blame	1
me	1

it	1
would	1

his	1
servant	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
petersburg	1
and	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
if	1
her	1
illness	1
was	1
a	1
trick	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
nothing	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
again	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
really	1
in	1
danger	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
before	1
her	1
death	1
he	1
would	1
forgive	1
her	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
alive	1
and	1
pay	1
her	1
the	1
last	1
duties	1
if	1
he	1
came	1
too	1
late	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
uncleanness	1
from	1

through	1

thinking	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
awaiting	1
him	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
because	1
in	1
picturing	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
drive	1
away	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
her	1
death	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
remove	1

past	1

it	1
all	1
trying	1
to	1
smother	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
awaiting	1
him	1
and	1
what	1
he	1

not	1

at	1
the	1

of	1

alexandrovitch	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
familiarity	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1

by	1

sat	1
down	1
again	1

his	1

down	1
to	1
his	1

as	1

the	1
sight	1
of	1

in	1
the	1

him	1
away	1
with	1
the	1

the	1
nervous	1
agitation	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
kept	1
increasing	1
and	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
reached	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
he	1
ceased	1
to	1
struggle	1
with	1
it	1
he	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
regarded	1
as	1
nervous	1
agitation	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
a	1
blissful	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
that	1
gave	1
him	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
new	1
happiness	1
he	1
had	1
never	1

trying	1
to	1
follow	1
enjoined	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
forgive	1

enemies	1
but	1
a	1
glad	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
his	1
enemies	1
filled	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
knelt	1
down	1
and	1
laying	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
her	1
arm	1
which	1
burned	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
fire	1
through	1
the	1
sleeve	1
he	1
sobbed	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
arm	1
around	1
his	1
head	1
moved	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
defiant	1
pride	1
lifted	1
up	1

up	1

submissively	1
and	1
looked	1
before	1

with	1
beaming	1
eyes	1

one	1
thing	1
that	1
i	1
needed	1
nothing	1

away	1
from	1

she	1
tossed	1
about	1

the	1
doctors	1

and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
ninety	1
nine	1
chances	1

in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
inquire	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
meeting	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1

him	1
to	1
his	1

there	1
was	1
a	1
return	1
again	1
of	1

and	1
again	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1

on	1
the	1
third	1

it	1
was	1
the	1

thing	1
and	1
the	1

said	1
there	1
was	1
hope	1
that	1
day	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
boudoir	1
where	1
vronsky	1
was	1
sitting	1
and	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
sat	1
down	1
opposite	1
him	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
vronsky	1
feeling	1
that	1
a	1
statement	1
of	1

was	1
coming	1
i	1
can	1

however	1
hard	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
you	1

me	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
terrible	1
for	1
me	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
risen	1
but	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
out	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
i	1
must	1
explain	1
my	1
feelings	1
the	1
feelings	1
that	1
have	1
guided	1
me	1
and	1
will	1
guide	1
me	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
error	1
regarding	1
me	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
had	1
resolved	1
on	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
begun	1
to	1
take	1
proceedings	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
conceal	1
from	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
beginning	1
this	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
misery	1
i	1
will	1
confess	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
pursued	1
by	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
revenge	1
myself	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
the	1
telegram	1
i	1
came	1
here	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
i	1
will	1
say	1
more	1
i	1
longed	1
for	1
her	1
death	1
but	1
he	1
paused	1
pondering	1
whether	1
to	1
disclose	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
disclose	1
his	1
feeling	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
saw	1
her	1
and	1
forgave	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
has	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
duty	1
i	1
forgive	1
completely	1
i	1
would	1
offer	1
the	1
other	1
cheek	1
i	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
cloak	1
if	1
my	1
coat	1
be	1
taken	1
i	1
pray	1
to	1
god	1
only	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
bliss	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
tears	1
stood	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
luminous	1
serene	1
look	1
in	1
them	1
impressed	1
vronsky	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
position	1
you	1
can	1
trample	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
make	1
me	1
the	1
laughing	1
stock	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
abandon	1
her	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
never	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
reproach	1
to	1
you	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
went	1
on	1
my	1
duty	1
is	1
clearly	1
marked	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
be	1
if	1
she	1
wishes	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
i	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
but	1
now	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
sobs	1
cut	1
short	1
his	1
words	1
vronsky	1
too	1
was	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
stooping	1
not	1
yet	1
erect	1
posture	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
feeling	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
higher	1
and	1
even	1
unattainable	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
life	1
chapter	1
18	1
after	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
vronsky	1
went	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
karenins	1
house	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
with	1
difficulty	1
remembering	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
walk	1
or	1
drive	1
he	1
felt	1
disgraced	1
humiliated	1
guilty	1
and	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
possibility	1
of	1
washing	1
away	1
his	1
humiliation	1
he	1
felt	1
thrust	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
beaten	1
track	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
proudly	1
and	1
lightly	1
walked	1
till	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
habits	1
and	1
rules	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
so	1
firm	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
suddenly	1
false	1
and	1
inapplicable	1
the	1
betrayed	1
husband	1
who	1
had	1
figured	1
till	1
that	1
time	1
as	1
a	1
pitiful	1
creature	1
an	1
incidental	1
and	1
somewhat	1
ludicrous	1
obstacle	1
to	1
his	1
happiness	1
had	1
suddenly	1
been	1
summoned	1
by	1
her	1
herself	1
elevated	1
to	1
an	1
awe	1
inspiring	1
pinnacle	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
pinnacle	1
that	1
husband	1
had	1
shown	1
himself	1
not	1
malignant	1
not	1
false	1
not	1
ludicrous	1
but	1
kind	1
and	1
straightforward	1

before	1

a	1

he	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

one	1
another	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
rapidity	1

the	1

poured	1
out	1

on	1

said	1
to	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
serene	1
confidence	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
man	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
tired	1
and	1
sleepy	1
he	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
the	1

instant	1
his	1
head	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
feel	1
drowsy	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
drop	1
off	1
into	1
forgetfulness	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
unconsciousness	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
meet	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
violent	1
shock	1
of	1
electricity	1
had	1
passed	1
over	1
him	1
he	1
started	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
leaped	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
arms	1
got	1
in	1
a	1
panic	1
onto	1
his	1
knees	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
wide	1
open	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
asleep	1
the	1
heaviness	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
weariness	1
in	1
his	1
limbs	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
had	1
suddenly	1
gone	1
you	1
may	1
trample	1
me	1
in	1
the	1

heard	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1

and	1
saw	1
him	1
standing	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
saw	1
anna	1

face	1
with	1
its	1
burning	1
flush	1
and	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
gazing	1
with	1
love	1
and	1
tenderness	1
not	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
at	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
own	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
foolish	1
and	1
ludicrous	1
figure	1
when	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
took	1
his	1
hands	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
legs	1
again	1
and	1
flung	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
and	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
sleep	1
to	1
forget	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself	1
but	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut	1
he	1
saw	1
more	1
distinctly	1
than	1
ever	1
anna	1

as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
memorable	1
evening	1
before	1

that	1

not	1

not	1

wants	1
to	1
wipe	1
it	1
out	1
of	1

without	1

he	1
said	1
aloud	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
began	1
to	1
repeat	1
these	1
words	1
this	1
repetition	1
checked	1
the	1
rising	1
up	1
of	1
fresh	1
images	1
and	1
memories	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
were	1
thronging	1
in	1
his	1
brain	1
but	1
repeating	1
words	1
did	1
not	1
check	1
his	1
imagination	1
for	1
long	1
again	1
in	1
extraordinarily	1
rapid	1
succession	1

best	1
moments	1

his	1

and	1
feels	1
the	1
shamestruck	1
and	1
idiotic	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
still	1
lay	1
down	1
trying	1
to	1
sleep	1
though	1
he	1
felt	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
hope	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
kept	1
repeating	1
stray	1
words	1
from	1
some	1
chain	1
of	1
thought	1
trying	1
by	1
this	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
rising	1
flood	1
of	1

in	1
a	1
strange	1

out	1

he	1
answered	1
himself	1
and	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
saw	1
with	1
wonder	1
an	1
embroidered	1
cushion	1
beside	1
him	1
worked	1
by	1
varya	1
his	1

touched	1
the	1
tassel	1
of	1
the	1

tried	1
to	1

he	1
moved	1
the	1

up	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1

into	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
that	1

now	1
there	1

up	1
from	1

took	1
off	1

undid	1
his	1
belt	1
and	1
uncovering	1
his	1

to	1

down	1

added	1
slowly	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
closed	1
it	1
then	1
with	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
and	1
clenched	1
teeth	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
took	1
a	1
revolver	1
looked	1
round	1
him	1
turned	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
loaded	1
barrel	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
thought	1
for	1
two	1
minutes	1
his	1
head	1
bent	1
forward	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
an	1
intense	1
effort	1
of	1
thought	1
he	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
revolver	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
motionless	1
thinking	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
logical	1
continuous	1
and	1
clear	1
chain	1
of	1
reasoning	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
indubitable	1
conclusion	1
in	1
reality	1
this	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
seemed	1
convincing	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
simply	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
circle	1
of	1
memories	1
and	1
images	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
ten	1
times	1
already	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
hour	1
memories	1
of	1
happiness	1
lost	1
forever	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
senselessness	1
of	1
everything	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
life	1
the	1
same	1
consciousness	1
of	1
humiliation	1
even	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
these	1
images	1
and	1
emotions	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
repeated	1
when	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
his	1
thought	1
passed	1
again	1
round	1
the	1
same	1
spellbound	1
circle	1
of	1
memories	1
and	1
images	1
and	1
pulling	1
the	1

to	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

the	1
sound	1

the	1

a	1
violent	1
blow	1
on	1
his	1

sent	1
him	1
reeling	1

tried	1
to	1
clutch	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1

dropped	1
the	1

staggered	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1

the	1
mistake	1
made	1
by	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
in	1
that	1
when	1
preparing	1
for	1
seeing	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
had	1
overlooked	1
the	1
possibility	1
that	1
her	1
repentance	1
might	1
be	1
sincere	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
forgive	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
die	1
this	1
mistake	1
was	1
two	1
months	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
moscow	1
brought	1
home	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
significance	1
but	1
the	1
mistake	1
made	1
by	1
him	1
had	1
arisen	1
not	1
simply	1
from	1
his	1
having	1
overlooked	1
that	1
contingency	1
but	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
until	1
that	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
dying	1
wife	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
his	1
own	1
heart	1
at	1
his	1
sick	1
wife	1
s	1
bedside	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
given	1
way	1
to	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
sympathetic	1
suffering	1
always	1
roused	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
others	1
and	1
hitherto	1
looked	1
on	1
by	1
him	1
with	1
shame	1
as	1
a	1
harmful	1
weakness	1
and	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
remorse	1
for	1
having	1
desired	1
her	1
death	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
made	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
conscious	1
not	1
simply	1
of	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
sufferings	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
spiritual	1
peace	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
experienced	1
before	1
he	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
his	1
sufferings	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
his	1
spiritual	1
joy	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
seemed	1
insoluble	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
judging	1
blaming	1
and	1
hating	1
had	1
become	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
when	1
he	1
forgave	1
and	1
loved	1
he	1
forgave	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
pitied	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
sufferings	1
and	1
her	1
remorse	1
he	1
forgave	1
vronsky	1
and	1
pitied	1
him	1
especially	1
after	1
reports	1
reached	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
despairing	1
action	1
he	1
felt	1
more	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
than	1
before	1
and	1
he	1
blamed	1
himself	1
now	1
for	1
having	1
taken	1
too	1
little	1
interest	1
in	1
him	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
newborn	1
baby	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
quite	1
peculiar	1
sentiment	1
not	1
of	1
pity	1
only	1
but	1
of	1
tenderness	1
at	1
first	1
from	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
compassion	1
alone	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
delicate	1
little	1
creature	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
child	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
cast	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
during	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
illness	1
and	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
died	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
troubled	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
observe	1
how	1
fond	1
he	1
became	1
of	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
nursery	1
several	1
times	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
sit	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
nurses	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
got	1
quite	1
used	1
to	1
his	1
presence	1
sometimes	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
at	1
a	1
stretch	1
he	1
would	1
sit	1
silently	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
saffron	1
red	1
downy	1
wrinkled	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sleeping	1
baby	1
watching	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
frowning	1
brows	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
little	1
hands	1
with	1
clenched	1
fingers	1
that	1
rubbed	1
the	1
little	1
eyes	1
and	1
nose	1
at	1
such	1
moments	1
particularly	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
perfect	1
peace	1
and	1
inward	1
harmony	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
nothing	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
changed	1
but	1
as	1
time	1
went	1
on	1
he	1
saw	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
distinctly	1
that	1
however	1
natural	1
the	1
position	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
long	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
it	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
besides	1
the	1
blessed	1
spiritual	1
force	1
controlling	1
his	1
soul	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
a	1
brutal	1
force	1
as	1
powerful	1
or	1
more	1
powerful	1
which	1
controlled	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
force	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
him	1
that	1
humble	1
peace	1
he	1
longed	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
inquiring	1
wonder	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
understood	1
and	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
above	1
all	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
instability	1
and	1
unnaturalness	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
when	1
the	1
softening	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
near	1
approach	1
of	1
death	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
began	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
anna	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
him	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
wanting	1
and	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
something	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
foreseeing	1
their	1
present	1
relations	1
could	1
not	1
continue	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
expecting	1
something	1
from	1
him	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
february	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
anna	1
s	1
baby	1
daughter	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
named	1
anna	1
too	1
fell	1
ill	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
leaving	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
office	1
on	1
finishing	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
returned	1
home	1
at	1
four	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
handsome	1
groom	1
in	1
a	1
braided	1
livery	1
and	1
a	1
bear	1
fur	1
cape	1
holding	1
a	1
white	1
fur	1
cloak	1
who	1
is	1
here	1
asked	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
princess	1
elizaveta	1
federovna	1
tverskaya	1
the	1
groom	1
answered	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
that	1
he	1
grinned	1
during	1
all	1
this	1
difficult	1
time	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
his	1
worldly	1
acquaintances	1
especially	1
women	1
took	1
a	1
peculiar	1
interest	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
all	1
these	1
acquaintances	1
he	1
observed	1
with	1
difficulty	1
concealing	1
their	1
mirth	1
at	1
something	1
the	1
same	1
mirth	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
perceived	1
in	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
eyes	1
and	1
just	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
this	1
groom	1
everyone	1
seemed	1
somehow	1
hugely	1
delighted	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
at	1
a	1
wedding	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
ill	1
disguised	1
enjoyment	1
they	1
inquired	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
health	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
princess	1
tverskaya	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
from	1
the	1
memories	1
associated	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
he	1
disliked	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
nursery	1
seryozha	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
was	1
drawing	1
and	1
chatting	1
away	1
merrily	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
who	1
had	1
during	1
anna	1
s	1
illness	1
replaced	1
the	1
french	1
one	1
was	1
sitting	1
near	1
the	1
boy	1
knitting	1
a	1
shawl	1
she	1
hurriedly	1
got	1
up	1
curtseyed	1
and	1
pulled	1
seryozha	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
stroked	1
his	1
son	1
s	1
hair	1
answered	1
the	1
governess	1
s	1
inquiries	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
nothing	1
serious	1
and	1
he	1
ordered	1
a	1
bath	1
sir	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
still	1
in	1
pain	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
screaming	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
sir	1
the	1
englishwoman	1
said	1
firmly	1
what	1
makes	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
he	1
asked	1
stopping	1
short	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
countess	1
paul	1
s	1
sir	1
they	1
gave	1
the	1
baby	1
medicine	1
and	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
simply	1
hungry	1
the	1
nurse	1
had	1
no	1
milk	1
sir	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
pondered	1
and	1
after	1
standing	1
still	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
lying	1
with	1
its	1
head	1
thrown	1
back	1
stiffening	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
nurse	1
s	1
arms	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
plump	1
breast	1
offered	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
never	1
ceased	1
screaming	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
double	1
hushing	1
of	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
nurse	1
who	1
was	1
bending	1
over	1
her	1
still	1
no	1
better	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
she	1
s	1
very	1
restless	1
answered	1
the	1
nurse	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
miss	1
edwarde	1
says	1
that	1
perhaps	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
has	1
no	1
milk	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
think	1
so	1
too	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
then	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
say	1
so	1
who	1
s	1
one	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
to	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
still	1
ill	1
said	1
the	1
nurse	1
discontentedly	1
the	1
nurse	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
simple	1
words	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
an	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1
position	1
the	1
baby	1
screamed	1
louder	1
than	1
ever	1
struggling	1
and	1
sobbing	1
the	1
nurse	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair	1
went	1
to	1
it	1
took	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
s	1
arms	1
and	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
rocking	1
it	1
you	1
must	1
ask	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
the	1
smartly	1
dressed	1
and	1
healthy	1
looking	1
nurse	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
losing	1
her	1
place	1
muttered	1
something	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
covering	1
her	1
bosom	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
doubts	1
being	1
cast	1
on	1
her	1
abundance	1
of	1
milk	1
in	1
that	1
smile	1
too	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
a	1
sneer	1
at	1
his	1
position	1
luckless	1
child	1
said	1
the	1
nurse	1
hushing	1
the	1
baby	1
and	1
still	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
it	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
despondent	1
and	1
suffering	1
face	1
watched	1
the	1
nurse	1
walking	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
when	1
the	1
child	1
at	1
last	1
was	1
still	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
bed	1
and	1
the	1
nurse	1
after	1
smoothing	1
the	1
little	1
pillow	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walking	1
awkwardly	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
approached	1
the	1
baby	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
despondent	1
face	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
moved	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
forehead	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
as	1
softly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
he	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
send	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1
he	1
felt	1
vexed	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
for	1
not	1
being	1
anxious	1
about	1
this	1
exquisite	1
baby	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
vexed	1
humor	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
either	1
to	1
see	1
princess	1
betsy	1
but	1
his	1
wife	1
might	1
wonder	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
so	1
overcoming	1
his	1
disinclination	1
he	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
bedroom	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
over	1
the	1
soft	1
rug	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
overhearing	1
a	1
conversation	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
if	1
he	1
hadn	1
t	1
been	1
going	1
away	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
understood	1
your	1

a	1

expression	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
stopped	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
back	1
unobserved	1
but	1
reflecting	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
undignified	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
clearing	1
his	1
throat	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
the	1
voices	1
were	1
silent	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
anna	1
in	1
a	1
gray	1
dressing	1
gown	1
with	1
a	1
crop	1
of	1
short	1
clustering	1
black	1
curls	1
on	1
her	1
round	1
head	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
settee	1
the	1
eagerness	1
died	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
did	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
she	1
dropped	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
uneasily	1
at	1
betsy	1
betsy	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion	1
in	1
a	1
hat	1
that	1
towered	1
somewhere	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
shade	1
on	1
a	1
lamp	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
dress	1
with	1
violet	1
crossway	1

with	1
a	1

and	1
affable	1
air	1
as	1

she	1
were	1
bestowing	1

magnanimity	1
on	1
him	1
for	1

his	1
departure	1
for	1
tashkend	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
was	1
evidently	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
have	1
everything	1
out	1
however	1
hard	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
for	1
her	1
i	1
told	1

she	1
stopped	1
suddenly	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1

short	1
i	1

alexandrovitch	1
advanced	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
her	1
hand	1
her	1
first	1
impulse	1
was	1
to	1
jerk	1
back	1
her	1
hand	1
from	1
the	1
damp	1
hand	1
with	1
big	1
swollen	1
veins	1
that	1
sought	1
hers	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
obvious	1
effort	1
to	1
control	1
herself	1
she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
confidence	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
feeling	1
with	1
confusion	1
and	1
annoyance	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
decide	1
easily	1
and	1
clearly	1
by	1
himself	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
discuss	1
before	1
princess	1
tverskaya	1
who	1
to	1
him	1
stood	1
for	1
the	1
incarnation	1
of	1
that	1
brute	1
force	1
which	1
would	1
inevitably	1
control	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
led	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
hinder	1
him	1
from	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
looking	1
at	1
princess	1
tverskaya	1
well	1
good	1
bye	1
my	1
darling	1
said	1
betsy	1
getting	1
up	1
she	1
kissed	1
anna	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
escorted	1
her	1
out	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
truly	1
magnanimous	1
man	1
said	1
betsy	1
stopping	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
with	1
special	1
warmth	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
once	1
more	1
i	1
am	1
an	1
outsider	1
but	1
i	1
so	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
respect	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
venture	1
to	1
advise	1
receive	1
him	1
alexey	1
vronsky	1
is	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
away	1
to	1
tashkend	1
thank	1
you	1
princess	1
for	1
your	1
sympathy	1
and	1
advice	1
but	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
whether	1
my	1
wife	1
can	1
or	1
cannot	1
see	1
anyone	1
she	1
must	1
decide	1
herself	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
from	1
habit	1
lifting	1
his	1
brows	1
with	1
dignity	1
and	1
reflected	1
immediately	1
that	1
whatever	1
his	1
words	1
might	1
be	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
dignity	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
this	1
by	1
the	1
suppressed	1
malicious	1
and	1
ironical	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
betsy	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
after	1
this	1
phrase	1
chapter	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
betsy	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
she	1
was	1
lying	1
down	1
but	1
hearing	1
his	1
steps	1
she	1
sat	1
up	1
hastily	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
attitude	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
way	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
crying	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
grateful	1
for	1
your	1
confidence	1
in	1
me	1
he	1
repeated	1
gently	1
in	1
russian	1
the	1
phrase	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
in	1
betsy	1
s	1
presence	1
in	1
french	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
russian	1
using	1
the	1
russian	1
thou	1
of	1
intimacy	1
and	1
affection	1
it	1
was	1
insufferably	1
irritating	1
to	1
anna	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
grateful	1
for	1
your	1
decision	1
i	1
too	1
imagine	1
that	1
since	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
away	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
necessity	1
for	1
count	1
vronsky	1
to	1
come	1
here	1
however	1
if	1
but	1
i	1
ve	1
said	1
so	1
already	1
so	1
why	1
repeat	1
it	1
anna	1
suddenly	1
interrupted	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
irritation	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
repressing	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
necessity	1
she	1
thought	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loves	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
ruin	1
himself	1
and	1
has	1
ruined	1
himself	1
and	1
who	1
cannot	1
live	1
without	1
him	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
necessity	1
she	1
compressed	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
dropped	1
her	1
burning	1
eyes	1
to	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
swollen	1
veins	1
they	1
were	1
rubbing	1
each	1
other	1
let	1
us	1
never	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
added	1
more	1
calmly	1
i	1
have	1
left	1
this	1
question	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
decide	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
beginning	1
that	1
my	1
wish	1
coincides	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
she	1
finished	1
quickly	1
exasperated	1
at	1
his	1
talking	1
so	1
slowly	1
while	1
she	1
knew	1
beforehand	1
all	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
yes	1
he	1
assented	1
and	1
princess	1
tverskaya	1
s	1
interference	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
private	1
affairs	1
is	1
utterly	1
uncalled	1
for	1
she	1
especially	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
s	1
said	1
about	1
her	1

anna	1
quickly	1
i	1
know	1
she	1
really	1
cares	1
for	1
me	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
sighed	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
she	1
played	1
nervously	1
with	1
the	1
tassel	1
of	1
her	1
dressing	1
gown	1
glancing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
that	1
torturing	1
sensation	1
of	1
physical	1
repulsion	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
blamed	1
herself	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
it	1
her	1
only	1
desire	1
now	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
his	1
oppressive	1
presence	1
i	1
have	1
just	1
sent	1
for	1

a	1

and	1
they	1

ordered	1

into	1

it	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
decidedly	1
as	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
room	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
s	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
hatred	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
altogether	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
that	1
mysterious	1
brutal	1
force	1
that	1
guided	1
his	1
life	1
against	1
his	1
spiritual	1
inclinations	1
and	1
exacted	1
conformity	1
with	1
its	1
decrees	1
and	1
change	1
in	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
been	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
such	1
distinctness	1
as	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
something	1
but	1
what	1
exactly	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
rousing	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
anger	1
destructive	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
his	1
achievement	1
he	1
believed	1
that	1
for	1
anna	1
herself	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
all	1
relations	1
with	1
vronsky	1
but	1
if	1
they	1
all	1
thought	1
this	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
ready	1
to	1
allow	1
these	1
relations	1
to	1
be	1
renewed	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
not	1
disgraced	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
deprived	1
of	1
them	1
nor	1
forced	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
position	1
bad	1
as	1
this	1
might	1
be	1
it	1
was	1
anyway	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
rupture	1
which	1
would	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
hopeless	1
and	1
shameful	1
position	1
and	1
deprive	1
him	1
of	1
everything	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
helpless	1
he	1
knew	1
beforehand	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
so	1
natural	1
and	1
right	1
but	1
would	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
wrong	1
though	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
proper	1
thing	1
to	1
them	1

was	1

much	1
of	1
sweetness	1

almost	1
feminine	1

that	1

a	1

twenty	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
yourself	1
you	1
married	1
him	1
without	1

and	1
not	1

what	1

was	1
a	1

mistake	1
said	1
anna	1
but	1
i	1
repeat	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
accomplished	1

then	1
you	1

let	1
us	1
say	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
love	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
your	1
husband	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
misfortune	1
but	1
that	1
too	1
is	1
an	1
accomplished	1
fact	1
and	1
your	1

forgave	1

at	1

for	1

she	1

no	1

you	1

that	1
if	1

with	1
the	1

somewhat	1

with	1
which	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
take	1
his	1

alexandrovitch	1
was	1
walking	1
about	1
his	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
his	1
back	1
thinking	1
of	1
just	1
what	1

had	1
been	1
discussing	1
with	1
his	1

on	1
the	1

of	1

in	1

becoming	1
suddenly	1
aware	1
of	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
unusual	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
conceal	1
this	1
embarrassment	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
cigarette	1

he	1
had	1
just	1
bought	1
that	1
opened	1
in	1
a	1

with	1
surprise	1
aware	1
of	1
an	1
unaccustomed	1
timidity	1
this	1
feeling	1
was	1
so	1
unexpected	1
and	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
conscience	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
meaning	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
wrong	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
and	1

with	1
the	1
timidity	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
him	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1

reddening	1
alexey	1

stood	1
still	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1

his	1
face	1
struck	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
by	1
its	1
expression	1
of	1
an	1
unresisting	1
sacrifice	1
i	1
intended	1
i	1

to	1
have	1
a	1

still	1
struggling	1
with	1
an	1
unaccustomed	1
constraint	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
smiled	1
mournfully	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
without	1
answering	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
took	1
from	1
it	1
an	1
unfinished	1
letter	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
i	1
think	1
unceasingly	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
begun	1
writing	1
thinking	1
i	1
could	1
say	1
it	1
better	1
by	1
letter	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
presence	1
irritates	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
letter	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
looked	1
with	1
incredulous	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
lusterless	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
so	1
immovably	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
my	1
presence	1
is	1
irksome	1
to	1
you	1
painful	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
otherwise	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
blame	1
you	1
and	1
god	1
is	1
my	1
witness	1
that	1
on	1
seeing	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
your	1
illness	1
i	1
resolved	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart	1
to	1
forget	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
new	1
life	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
regret	1
and	1
shall	1
never	1
regret	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
desired	1
one	1
thing	1
your	1
good	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
your	1
soul	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
see	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
attained	1
that	1
tell	1
me	1
yourself	1
what	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
true	1
happiness	1
and	1
peace	1
to	1
your	1
soul	1
i	1
put	1
myself	1
entirely	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
and	1
trust	1
to	1
your	1
feeling	1
of	1
what	1
s	1
right	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
handed	1
back	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
surprise	1
continued	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
silence	1
was	1
so	1
awkward	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
lips	1
began	1
twitching	1
nervously	1
while	1
he	1
still	1
gazed	1
without	1
speaking	1
at	1
karenin	1
s	1
face	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
turning	1
away	1
yes	1
yes	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
were	1
choking	1
him	1
yes	1
yes	1
i	1
understand	1
you	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
like	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
judge	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
recovering	1
himself	1
she	1
is	1
crushed	1
simply	1
crushed	1
by	1
your	1
generosity	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
read	1
this	1
letter	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
incapable	1
of	1
saying	1
anything	1
she	1
would	1
only	1
hang	1
her	1
head	1
lower	1
than	1
ever	1
yes	1
but	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
how	1
explain	1
how	1
find	1
out	1
her	1
wishes	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
opinion	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
lies	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
directly	1
the	1
steps	1
you	1
consider	1
necessary	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
position	1
so	1
you	1
consider	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
ended	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
interrupted	1
him	1
but	1
how	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
not	1
usual	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
see	1
no	1
possible	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
position	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
standing	1
up	1
and	1
becoming	1
more	1
cheerful	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
thought	1
of	1
breaking	1
off	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
convinced	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
cannot	1
make	1
each	1
other	1
happy	1
happiness	1
may	1
be	1
variously	1
understood	1
but	1
suppose	1
that	1
i	1
agree	1

the	1

my	1

is	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
a	1

yes	1

yes	1
divorce	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
repeated	1
reddening	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
the	1
most	1
rational	1
course	1
for	1
married	1
people	1
who	1
find	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1

you	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
sighed	1
heavily	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
there	1
s	1
only	1
one	1
point	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
is	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
parties	1
desirous	1
of	1
forming	1

if	1
not	1
it	1
is	1

more	1
and	1
more	1
free	1
from	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
scowling	1
with	1
emotion	1
muttered	1
something	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
all	1
that	1
seemed	1
so	1
simple	1
to	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
thought	1
over	1
thousands	1
of	1
times	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
simple	1
it	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
divorce	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
because	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
dignity	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
religion	1
forbade	1
his	1
taking	1
upon	1
himself	1
a	1
fictitious	1
charge	1
of	1
adultery	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
suffering	1
his	1
wife	1
pardoned	1

beloved	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
public	1
shame	1

appeared	1
to	1
him	1
impossible	1
also	1
on	1
other	1
still	1
more	1
weighty	1
grounds	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
his	1

of	1

illegitimate	1
family	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
position	1
as	1
a	1

would	1
not	1
be	1
good	1

him	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
vengeance	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
but	1
apart	1
from	1
this	1
what	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
made	1
divorce	1

impossible	1
to	1
alexey	1

that	1

he	1
had	1
thought	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times	1

was	1
convinced	1
that	1
a	1

was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
simple	1
as	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
said	1

was	1
utterly	1

to	1
him	1
to	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
thousand	1
objections	1
to	1
make	1
but	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
mighty	1
brutal	1
force	1
which	1
controlled	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
submit	1
the	1
only	1
question	1
is	1
on	1
what	1
terms	1
you	1
agree	1
to	1

her	1
a	1

she	1
does	1
not	1

of	1

proceedings	1
in	1
which	1
the	1

took	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
himself	1
and	1
with	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
gesture	1
with	1
which	1
vronsky	1
had	1
done	1
the	1

he	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
for	1
shame	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
you	1
are	1
distressed	1
i	1
understand	1

it	1
over	1
whosoever	1

thee	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1

to	1
him	1

if	1
any	1

take	1
away	1
thy	1

let	1
him	1
have	1
thy	1

yes	1

cried	1
in	1
a	1
shrill	1
voice	1
i	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
disgrace	1
on	1
myself	1
i	1
will	1

up	1
even	1

wouldn	1

better	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
alone	1
still	1
you	1
may	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
so	1
that	1
his	1

in	1

could	1
not	1

him	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1

at	1

there	1
was	1
bitterness	1
there	1
was	1

in	1

with	1
bitterness	1
and	1
shame	1
he	1

at	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
own	1

appreciates	1
your	1

he	1
said	1

it	1
seems	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
god	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
felt	1
how	1
foolish	1
a	1
remark	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
with	1
difficulty	1
repressed	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
foolishness	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
some	1
reply	1
but	1
tears	1
stopped	1
him	1
this	1

an	1
unhappy	1

went	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1

he	1
was	1
touched	1

that	1
did	1
not	1

him	1
from	1
being	1
glad	1
he	1
had	1
successfully	1
brought	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
words	1
to	1
this	1
satisfaction	1
was	1
added	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
an	1
idea	1
had	1
just	1
struck	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
riddle	1
turning	1
on	1
his	1
successful	1
achievement	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
would	1
ask	1
his	1

he	1
put	1
this	1
riddle	1
into	1
two	1

three	1

ways	1

i	1
ll	1
work	1
it	1
out	1
better	1

with	1

clear	1
not	1

their	1
expression	1
was	1

she	1
said	1
you	1

not	1
in	1
pain	1
a	1
little	1
here	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
his	1
breast	1
then	1
let	1
me	1
change	1
your	1
bandages	1
in	1
silence	1
stiffening	1
his	1

he	1
looked	1
at	1

while	1
she	1
bandaged	1

up	1
when	1

it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
and	1
he	1
smiled	1
gloomily	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
this	1
smile	1
which	1
so	1
frightened	1
varya	1
when	1
the	1
inflammation	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
recover	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
completely	1
free	1
from	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
misery	1
by	1
his	1
action	1
he	1
had	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
washed	1
away	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
humiliation	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
now	1
think	1
calmly	1
of	1
alexey	1

he	1
recognized	1
all	1
his	1
magnanimity	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
feel	1
himself	1
humiliated	1
by	1
it	1
besides	1
he	1
got	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
beaten	1
track	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
looking	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
again	1
without	1
shame	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
live	1
in	1

with	1
his	1
own	1
habits	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
pluck	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
though	1
he	1
never	1
ceased	1
struggling	1
with	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
regret	1
amounting	1
to	1
despair	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
forever	1
that	1
now	1
having	1
expiated	1
his	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
husband	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
renounce	1
her	1
and	1
never	1
in	1

to	1
stand	1
between	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
repentance	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
he	1
had	1
firmly	1
decided	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1

he	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
his	1
regret	1
at	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
erase	1
from	1
his	1
memory	1
those	1
moments	1
of	1
happiness	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
little	1
prized	1
at	1
the	1

and	1
that	1
haunted	1

vronsky	1
agreed	1
to	1

without	1
the	1

the	1
nearer	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
departure	1
came	1
the	1
bitterer	1
was	1
the	1

preparations	1
for	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
tashkend	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
once	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
bury	1
myself	1
to	1
die	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
paying	1
farewell	1
visits	1
he	1
uttered	1
this	1
thought	1
to	1
betsy	1
charged	1
with	1
this	1
commission	1
betsy	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
anna	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
back	1
a	1
negative	1
reply	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
thought	1
vronsky	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
news	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
weakness	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
shattered	1
what	1
strength	1
i	1
have	1
left	1
next	1
day	1
betsy	1
herself	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
announced	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
through	1
oblonsky	1
as	1
a	1
positive	1
fact	1
that	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
vronsky	1
could	1
see	1
anna	1
without	1
even	1
troubling	1
himself	1
to	1
see	1
betsy	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
flat	1
forgetting	1
all	1
his	1
resolutions	1
without	1
asking	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
where	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
vronsky	1
drove	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
karenins	1
he	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
seeing	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
nothing	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
step	1
almost	1
breaking	1
into	1
a	1
run	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
without	1
considering	1
without	1
noticing	1
whether	1
there	1
was	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
or	1
not	1
he	1
flung	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cover	1
her	1
face	1
her	1
hands	1
her	1
neck	1
with	1
kisses	1
anna	1
had	1
been	1
preparing	1
herself	1
for	1
this	1
meeting	1
had	1
thought	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
saying	1
anything	1
of	1
it	1
his	1
passion	1
mastered	1
her	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
calm	1
him	1
to	1
calm	1
herself	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
his	1
feeling	1
infected	1
her	1
her	1
lips	1
trembled	1
so	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
yes	1
you	1
have	1
conquered	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
yours	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
pressing	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
her	1
bosom	1
so	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
we	1
live	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
now	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
whiter	1
and	1
whiter	1
and	1
embracing	1
his	1
head	1
still	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
terrible	1
in	1
it	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
pass	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
pass	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
so	1
happy	1
our	1
love	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
stronger	1
will	1
be	1
strengthened	1
by	1
there	1
being	1
something	1
terrible	1
in	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
parting	1
his	1
strong	1
teeth	1
in	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
respond	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
love	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
she	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
stroked	1
her	1
chilled	1
cheeks	1
and	1
cropped	1
head	1
with	1
it	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
with	1
this	1
short	1
hair	1
you	1
ve	1
grown	1
so	1
pretty	1
a	1
boy	1
but	1
how	1
pale	1
you	1
are	1
yes	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
weak	1
she	1
said	1
smiling	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
began	1
trembling	1
again	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
italy	1
you	1
will	1
get	1
strong	1
he	1
said	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
we	1
could	1
be	1
like	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
alone	1
your	1
family	1
with	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
close	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
it	1
only	1
seems	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
ever	1
have	1
been	1
otherwise	1
stiva	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
agreed	1
to	1
everything	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
accept	1
his	1
generosity	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
dreamily	1
past	1
vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
a	1
divorce	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
only	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
decide	1
about	1
seryozha	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
how	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
of	1
their	1
meeting	1
she	1
could	1
remember	1
and	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
of	1
divorce	1
what	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
matter	1
don	1
t	1
speak	1
of	1
that	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
turning	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
still	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
oh	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1
i	1
die	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
silent	1
tears	1
flowed	1
down	1
both	1
her	1
cheeks	1
but	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
smile	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
wound	1
him	1
to	1
decline	1
the	1
flattering	1
and	1
dangerous	1
appointment	1
at	1
tashkend	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
vronsky	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
considered	1
disgraceful	1
and	1
impossible	1
but	1
now	1
without	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
consideration	1
he	1
declined	1
it	1
and	1
observing	1
dissatisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
exalted	1
quarters	1
at	1
this	1
step	1
he	1
immediately	1
retired	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
a	1
month	1
later	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
petersburg	1
while	1
anna	1
and	1
vronsky	1
had	1
gone	1
abroad	1
not	1
having	1
obtained	1
a	1
divorce	1
but	1
having	1
absolutely	1
declined	1
all	1
idea	1
of	1
one	1
part	1
five	1
chapter	1
1	1
princess	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
considered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
the	1
wedding	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
before	1
lent	1
just	1
five	1
weeks	1
off	1
since	1
not	1
half	1
the	1
trousseau	1
could	1
possibly	1
be	1
ready	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
agree	1
with	1
levin	1
that	1
to	1
fix	1
it	1
for	1
after	1
lent	1
would	1
be	1
putting	1
it	1
off	1
too	1
late	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
aunt	1
of	1
prince	1
shtcherbatsky	1
s	1
was	1
seriously	1
ill	1
and	1
might	1
die	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
mourning	1
would	1
delay	1
the	1
wedding	1
still	1
longer	1
and	1
therefore	1
deciding	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
trousseau	1
into	1
two	1
parts	1
a	1
larger	1
and	1
smaller	1
trousseau	1
the	1
princess	1
consented	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
wedding	1
before	1
lent	1
she	1
determined	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
get	1
the	1
smaller	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
trousseau	1
all	1
ready	1
now	1
and	1
the	1
larger	1
part	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
later	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
vexed	1
with	1
levin	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
a	1
serious	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
agreed	1
to	1
this	1
arrangement	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
arrangement	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
suitable	1
as	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
wedding	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
where	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
trousseau	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
wanted	1
levin	1
still	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
delirious	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
happiness	1
constituted	1
the	1
chief	1
and	1
sole	1
aim	1
of	1
all	1
existence	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
now	1
think	1
or	1
care	1
about	1
anything	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
others	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
plans	1
and	1
aims	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
he	1
left	1
its	1
arrangement	1
to	1
others	1
knowing	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
be	1
delightful	1
his	1
brother	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
guided	1
him	1
in	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
agree	1
entirely	1
with	1
everything	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
brother	1
raised	1
money	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
princess	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
moscow	1
after	1
the	1
wedding	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
he	1
agreed	1
to	1
everything	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
choose	1
if	1
it	1
amuses	1
you	1
i	1
m	1
happy	1
and	1
my	1
happiness	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
greater	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
for	1
anything	1
you	1
do	1
he	1
thought	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
kitty	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
advice	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
abroad	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
surprised	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
to	1
this	1
and	1
had	1
some	1
definite	1
requirements	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
their	1
future	1
she	1
knew	1
levin	1
had	1
work	1
he	1
loved	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
understand	1
this	1
work	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
care	1
to	1
understand	1
it	1
but	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
regarding	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
knew	1
their	1
home	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
not	1
abroad	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
their	1
home	1
would	1
be	1
this	1
definitely	1
expressed	1
purpose	1
astonished	1
levin	1
but	1
since	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
either	1
way	1
he	1
immediately	1
asked	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
to	1
arrange	1
everything	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
ability	1
with	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
but	1
i	1
say	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
day	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
everything	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
s	1
arrival	1
have	1
you	1
a	1
certificate	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
at	1
confession	1
no	1
but	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
married	1
without	1
it	1
aïe	1
aïe	1
aïe	1
	1
cried	1
levin	1
why	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
s	1
nine	1
years	1
since	1
i	1
ve	1
taken	1
the	1
sacrament	1
i	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
pretty	1
fellow	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
laughing	1
and	1
you	1
call	1
me	1
a	1
nihilist	1
but	1
this	1
won	1
t	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
must	1
take	1
the	1
sacrament	1
when	1
there	1
are	1
four	1
days	1
left	1
now	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
arranged	1
this	1
also	1
and	1
levin	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
confession	1
to	1
levin	1
as	1
to	1
any	1
unbeliever	1
who	1
respects	1
the	1
beliefs	1
of	1
others	1
it	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
and	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
church	1
ceremonies	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
in	1
his	1
present	1
softened	1
state	1
of	1
feeling	1
sensitive	1
to	1
everything	1
this	1
inevitable	1
act	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
painful	1
to	1
levin	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
heyday	1
of	1
his	1
highest	1
glory	1
his	1
fullest	1
flower	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
liar	1
or	1
a	1
scoffer	1
he	1
felt	1
incapable	1
of	1
being	1
either	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
plied	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
with	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
obtaining	1
a	1
certificate	1
without	1
actually	1
communicating	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
maintained	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
besides	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
an	1
awfully	1
nice	1
clever	1
old	1
fellow	1
he	1
ll	1
pull	1
the	1
tooth	1
out	1
for	1
you	1
so	1
gently	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
notice	1
it	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
litany	1
levin	1
attempted	1
to	1
revive	1
in	1
himself	1
his	1
youthful	1
recollections	1
of	1
the	1
intense	1
religious	1
emotion	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
between	1
the	1
ages	1
of	1
sixteen	1
and	1
seventeen	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
attempted	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
an	1
empty	1
custom	1
having	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
meaning	1
like	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
paying	1
calls	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
that	1
either	1
levin	1
found	1
himself	1
like	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
his	1
contemporaries	1
in	1
the	1
vaguest	1
position	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
religion	1
believe	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
firm	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
wrong	1
and	1
consequently	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
nor	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
with	1
indifference	1
as	1
an	1
empty	1
formality	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
period	1
of	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
sacrament	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
discomfort	1
and	1
shame	1
at	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
understand	1
and	1
what	1
as	1
an	1
inner	1
voice	1
told	1
him	1
was	1
therefore	1
false	1
and	1
wrong	1
during	1
the	1
service	1
he	1
would	1
first	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
prayers	1
trying	1
to	1
attach	1
some	1
meaning	1
to	1
them	1
not	1
discordant	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
views	1
then	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
and	1
must	1
condemn	1
them	1
he	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
thoughts	1
observations	1
and	1
memories	1
which	1
floated	1
through	1
his	1
brain	1
with	1
extreme	1
vividness	1
during	1
this	1
idle	1
time	1
of	1
standing	1
in	1
church	1
he	1
had	1
stood	1
through	1
the	1
litany	1
the	1
evening	1
service	1
and	1
the	1
midnight	1
service	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
earlier	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
without	1
having	1
tea	1
went	1
at	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
for	1
the	1
morning	1
service	1
and	1
the	1
confession	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
but	1
a	1
beggar	1
soldier	1
two	1
old	1
women	1
and	1
the	1
church	1
officials	1
a	1
young	1
deacon	1
whose	1
long	1
back	1
showed	1
in	1
two	1
distinct	1
halves	1
through	1
his	1
thin	1
undercassock	1
met	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
at	1
the	1
wall	1
read	1
the	1
exhortation	1
during	1
the	1
reading	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
frequent	1
and	1
rapid	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
which	1
resounded	1
with	1
an	1
echo	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
thought	1
was	1
shut	1
and	1
sealed	1
up	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
touched	1
or	1
stirred	1
now	1
or	1
confusion	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
result	1
and	1
so	1
standing	1
behind	1
the	1
deacon	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
affairs	1
neither	1
listening	1
nor	1
examining	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
it	1
s	1
wonderful	1
what	1
expression	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
thought	1
remembering	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
table	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
as	1
was	1
almost	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
kept	1
opening	1
and	1
shutting	1
it	1
and	1
laughed	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
her	1
action	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
kissed	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
had	1
examined	1
the	1
lines	1
on	1
the	1
pink	1
palm	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
again	1
thought	1
levin	1
crossing	1
himself	1
bowing	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
supple	1
spring	1
of	1
the	1
deacon	1
s	1
back	1
bowing	1
before	1
him	1
she	1
took	1
my	1
hand	1
then	1
and	1
examined	1
the	1
lines	1
you	1
ve	1
got	1
a	1
splendid	1
hand	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
short	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
deacon	1
yes	1
now	1
it	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
over	1
he	1
thought	1
no	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
beginning	1
again	1
he	1
thought	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
prayers	1
no	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
ending	1
there	1
he	1
is	1
bowing	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
s	1
always	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
deacon	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
plush	1
cuff	1
accepted	1
a	1
three	1
rouble	1
note	1
unobtrusively	1
and	1
the	1
deacon	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
put	1
it	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
register	1
and	1
his	1
new	1
boots	1
creaking	1
jauntily	1
over	1
the	1
flagstones	1
of	1
the	1
empty	1
church	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
he	1
peeped	1
out	1
thence	1
and	1
beckoned	1
to	1
levin	1
thought	1
till	1
then	1
locked	1
up	1
began	1
to	1
stir	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
head	1
but	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
drive	1
it	1
away	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
right	1
somehow	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
altar	1
rails	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
saw	1
the	1
priest	1
the	1
priest	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
scanty	1
grizzled	1
beard	1
and	1
weary	1
good	1
natured	1
eyes	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
rails	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
a	1
missal	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
to	1
levin	1
he	1
began	1
immediately	1
reading	1
prayers	1
in	1
the	1
official	1
voice	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
them	1
he	1
bowed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
turned	1
facing	1
levin	1
christ	1
is	1
present	1
here	1
unseen	1
receiving	1
your	1
confession	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
crucifix	1
do	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
doctrines	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
apostolic	1
church	1
the	1
priest	1
went	1
on	1
turning	1
his	1
eyes	1
away	1
from	1
levin	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
folding	1
his	1
hands	1
under	1
his	1
stole	1
i	1
have	1
doubted	1
i	1
doubt	1
everything	1
said	1
levin	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
jarred	1
on	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
the	1
priest	1
waited	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
more	1
and	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
said	1
quickly	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
vladimirsky	1
accent	1
doubt	1
is	1
natural	1
to	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
mankind	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
pray	1
that	1
god	1
in	1
his	1
mercy	1
will	1
strengthen	1
us	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
special	1
sins	1
he	1
added	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
interval	1
as	1
though	1
anxious	1
not	1
to	1
waste	1
time	1
my	1
chief	1
sin	1
is	1
doubt	1
i	1
have	1
doubts	1
of	1
everything	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
doubt	1
doubt	1
is	1
natural	1
to	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
mankind	1
the	1
priest	1
repeated	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
doubt	1
about	1
principally	1
i	1
doubt	1
of	1
everything	1
i	1
sometimes	1
even	1
have	1
doubts	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
god	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
but	1
levin	1
s	1
words	1
did	1
not	1
it	1
seemed	1
make	1
much	1
impression	1
on	1
the	1
priest	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
doubt	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
god	1
he	1
said	1
hurriedly	1
with	1
a	1
just	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
what	1
doubt	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
the	1
creator	1
when	1
you	1
behold	1
his	1
creation	1
the	1
priest	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
rapid	1
customary	1
jargon	1
who	1
has	1
decked	1
the	1
heavenly	1
firmament	1
with	1
its	1
lights	1
who	1
has	1
clothed	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
its	1
beauty	1
how	1
explain	1
it	1
without	1
the	1
creator	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
levin	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
improper	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
a	1
metaphysical	1
discussion	1
with	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
merely	1
what	1
was	1
a	1
direct	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
then	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
doubt	1
that	1
god	1
created	1
all	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
with	1
good	1
humored	1
perplexity	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
said	1
levin	1
blushing	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
stupid	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
stupid	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
pray	1
to	1
god	1
and	1
beseech	1
him	1
even	1
the	1
holy	1
fathers	1
had	1
doubts	1
and	1
prayed	1
to	1
god	1
to	1
strengthen	1
their	1
faith	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
resist	1
him	1
pray	1
to	1
god	1
beseech	1
him	1
pray	1
to	1
god	1
he	1
repeated	1
hurriedly	1
the	1
priest	1
paused	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
as	1
though	1
meditating	1
you	1
re	1
about	1
i	1
hear	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
parishioner	1
and	1
son	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
prince	1
shtcherbatsky	1
he	1
resumed	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
an	1
excellent	1
young	1
lady	1
yes	1
answered	1
levin	1
blushing	1
for	1
the	1
priest	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
about	1
this	1
at	1
confession	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
answering	1
his	1
thought	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
you	1
are	1
about	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
holy	1
matrimony	1
and	1
god	1
may	1
bless	1
you	1
with	1
offspring	1
well	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
bringing	1
up	1
can	1
you	1
give	1
your	1
babes	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
overcome	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
enticing	1
you	1
to	1
infidelity	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
gentle	1
reproachfulness	1
if	1
you	1
love	1
your	1
child	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
father	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
desire	1
only	1
wealth	1
luxury	1
honor	1
for	1
your	1
infant	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
anxious	1
for	1
his	1
salvation	1
his	1
spiritual	1
enlightenment	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
truth	1
eh	1
what	1
answer	1
will	1
you	1
make	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
innocent	1
babe	1
asks	1
you	1
papa	1
who	1
made	1
all	1
that	1
enchants	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
the	1
earth	1
the	1
waters	1
the	1
sun	1
the	1
flowers	1
the	1
grass	1
can	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
cannot	1
but	1
know	1
since	1
the	1
lord	1
god	1
in	1
his	1
infinite	1
mercy	1
has	1
revealed	1
it	1
to	1
us	1
or	1
your	1
child	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
what	1
awaits	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
beyond	1
the	1
tomb	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
you	1
know	1
nothing	1
how	1
will	1
you	1
answer	1
him	1
will	1
you	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
allurements	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
right	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
stopped	1
putting	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
levin	1
with	1
his	1
kindly	1
gentle	1
eyes	1
levin	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
this	1
time	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
a	1
discussion	1
with	1
the	1
priest	1
but	1
because	1
so	1
far	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
ever	1
asked	1
him	1
such	1
questions	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
babes	1
did	1
ask	1
him	1
those	1
questions	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
answering	1
them	1
you	1
are	1
entering	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
pursued	1
the	1
priest	1
when	1
you	1
must	1
choose	1
your	1
path	1
and	1
keep	1
to	1
it	1
pray	1
to	1
god	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
in	1
his	1
mercy	1
aid	1
you	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
you	1
he	1
concluded	1
our	1
lord	1
and	1
god	1
jesus	1
christ	1
in	1
the	1
abundance	1
and	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
lovingkindness	1
forgives	1
this	1
child	1
and	1
finishing	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
absolution	1
the	1
priest	1
blessed	1
him	1
and	1
dismissed	1
him	1
on	1
getting	1
home	1
that	1
day	1
levin	1
had	1
a	1
delightful	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
at	1
the	1
awkward	1
position	1
being	1
over	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
got	1
through	1
without	1
his	1
having	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
apart	1
from	1
this	1
there	1
remained	1
a	1
vague	1
memory	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
kind	1
nice	1
old	1
fellow	1
had	1
said	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
so	1
stupid	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
fancied	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
cleared	1
up	1
of	1
course	1
not	1
now	1
thought	1
levin	1
but	1
some	1
day	1
later	1
on	1
levin	1
felt	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
now	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
clear	1
and	1
not	1
clean	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
religion	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
which	1
he	1
perceived	1
so	1
clearly	1
and	1
disliked	1
in	1
others	1
and	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
blamed	1
his	1
friend	1
sviazhsky	1
levin	1
spent	1
that	1
evening	1
with	1
his	1
betrothed	1
at	1
dolly	1
s	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
very	1
high	1
spirits	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
being	1
trained	1
to	1
jump	1
through	1
a	1
hoop	1
who	1
having	1
at	1
last	1
caught	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
done	1
what	1
was	1
required	1
of	1
him	1

wags	1
its	1
tail	1

jumps	1
up	1

recalled	1
the	1

only	1
in	1

voice	1
suddenly	1
whispered	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
smile	1
died	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
suddenly	1
a	1
strange	1
feeling	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
there	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
a	1
dread	1
and	1
doubt	1
doubt	1
of	1
everything	1
what	1
if	1
she	1

himself	1
she	1
may	1

to	1
her	1
senses	1
and	1
only	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
being	1

realize	1
that	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
love	1
me	1
and	1
strange	1
most	1
evil	1
thoughts	1
of	1
her	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
evening	1

everything	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
quickly	1
no	1
this	1
can	1

ask	1
her	1

so	1
anything	1
s	1
better	1
than	1
endless	1
misery	1
disgrace	1
unfaithfulness	1
with	1
despair	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
bitter	1
anger	1
against	1
all	1
men	1
against	1
himself	1
against	1
her	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hotel	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
her	1
house	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
back	1
rooms	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
chest	1
and	1
making	1
some	1
arrangements	1
with	1
her	1
maid	1
sorting	1
over	1
heaps	1
of	1
dresses	1
of	1
different	1
colors	1
spread	1
on	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
chairs	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
ah	1

cried	1

him	1
and	1
beaming	1
with	1
delight	1

what	1

the	1
matter	1
she	1
asked	1
definitely	1
adopting	1
this	1
familiar	1
name	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
maid	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
she	1
noticed	1
his	1
strange	1
face	1
agitated	1
and	1
gloomy	1
and	1
a	1
panic	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
kitty	1
i	1
m	1
in	1
torture	1
i	1
can	1

alone	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
despair	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
standing	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
looking	1
imploringly	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
he	1
saw	1
already	1
from	1
her	1
loving	1
truthful	1
face	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
come	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
yet	1
he	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
reassure	1
him	1
herself	1
i	1

to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1

stopped	1
and	1

re	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mind	1
she	1
cried	1
turning	1
crimson	1
with	1
vexation	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
piteous	1
that	1
she	1
restrained	1
her	1
vexation	1
and	1
flinging	1
some	1
clothes	1
off	1
an	1
armchair	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
i	1

she	1
said	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
oh	1
what	1
have	1
i	1
done	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
kneeling	1
before	1
her	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
kissing	1
her	1
hands	1
when	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
five	1
minutes	1
later	1
she	1
found	1
them	1
completely	1
reconciled	1
kitty	1
had	1
not	1
simply	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
but	1
had	1
gone	1
so	1
far	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
question	1
what	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
for	1
as	1
to	1
explain	1
what	1
for	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
because	1
she	1
understood	1
him	1
completely	1
because	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
and	1
because	1
everything	1
he	1
liked	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
perfectly	1
clear	1
when	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
sitting	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
on	1
the	1
chest	1
sorting	1
the	1
dresses	1
and	1
disputing	1
over	1
kitty	1
s	1
wanting	1
to	1
give	1
dunyasha	1
the	1
brown	1
dress	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
wearing	1
when	1
levin	1
proposed	1
to	1
her	1
while	1
he	1
insisted	1
that	1
that	1
dress	1
must	1
never	1

peeping	1
through	1

more	1
than	1
twenty	1

and	1
long	1

there	1
was	1
discreet	1

lively	1
conversation	1
that	1
echoed	1
strangely	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
cupola	1
every	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
creak	1
of	1
the	1
opened	1
door	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
died	1
away	1
and	1
everybody	1
looked	1
round	1
expecting	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
come	1
in	1
but	1
the	1
door	1
had	1
opened	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
times	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
either	1
a	1
belated	1
guest	1
or	1
guests	1
who	1
joined	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
invited	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
or	1
a	1
spectator	1
who	1
had	1
eluded	1
or	1
softened	1
the	1
police	1
officer	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
outsiders	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
both	1
the	1
guests	1
and	1
the	1
outside	1
public	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
passed	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
phases	1
of	1
anticipation	1
at	1
first	1
they	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
would	1
arrive	1
immediately	1
and	1
attached	1
no	1
importance	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
their	1
being	1
late	1
then	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
whether	1
anything	1
could	1
have	1
happened	1
then	1
the	1
long	1
delay	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
positively	1
discomforting	1
and	1
relations	1
and	1
guests	1
tried	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
but	1
were	1
engrossed	1
in	1
conversation	1
the	1
head	1
deacon	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
remind	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
coughed	1
impatiently	1
making	1
the	1
window	1
panes	1
quiver	1
in	1
their	1
frames	1
in	1
the	1
choir	1
the	1
bored	1
choristers	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
trying	1
their	1
voices	1
and	1
blowing	1
their	1
noses	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
continually	1
sending	1
first	1
the	1
beadle	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
deacon	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
he	1
went	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
lilac	1
vestment	1
and	1
an	1
embroidered	1
sash	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
door	1
expecting	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
at	1
last	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
said	1
it	1
really	1
is	1
strange	1
though	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
became	1
uneasy	1
and	1
began	1
loudly	1
expressing	1
their	1
wonder	1
and	1
dissatisfaction	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
s	1
best	1
men	1
went	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
kitty	1
meanwhile	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
been	1
quite	1
ready	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
white	1
dress	1
and	1
long	1
veil	1
and	1
wreath	1
of	1
orange	1
blossoms	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
madame	1
lvova	1
who	1
was	1
her	1
bridal	1
mother	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
over	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
anxiously	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
the	1
best	1
man	1
that	1
her	1
bridegroom	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
church	1
levin	1
meanwhile	1
in	1
his	1
trousers	1
but	1
without	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
waistcoat	1
was	1
walking	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
hotel	1
continually	1
putting	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
corridor	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
in	1
despair	1
and	1
frantically	1
waving	1
his	1
hands	1
addressed	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
who	1
was	1
smoking	1
serenely	1
was	1
ever	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
fearful	1
fool	1
s	1
position	1
he	1
said	1
yes	1
it	1
is	1
stupid	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
assented	1
smiling	1
soothingly	1
but	1
don	1
t	1
worry	1
it	1
ll	1
be	1
brought	1
directly	1
no	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
said	1
levin	1
with	1
smothered	1
fury	1
and	1
these	1
fools	1
of	1
open	1
waistcoats	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
crumpled	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
shirt	1
and	1
what	1
if	1
the	1
things	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
he	1
roared	1
in	1
desperation	1
then	1
you	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
mine	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
long	1
ago	1
if	1
at	1
all	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
nice	1
to	1
look	1
ridiculous	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
round	1
the	1
point	1
was	1
that	1
when	1
levin	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
evening	1
suit	1
kouzma	1
his	1
old	1
servant	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
the	1
coat	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
wanted	1
but	1
the	1
shirt	1
cried	1
levin	1
you	1
ve	1
got	1
a	1
shirt	1
on	1
kouzma	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
placid	1
smile	1
kouzma	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
of	1
leaving	1
out	1
a	1
clean	1
shirt	1
and	1
on	1
receiving	1
instructions	1
to	1
pack	1
up	1
everything	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
were	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
the	1
same	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
packing	1
everything	1
but	1
the	1
dress	1
suit	1
the	1
shirt	1
worn	1
since	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
crumpled	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
with	1
the	1
fashionable	1
open	1
waistcoat	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
they	1
sent	1
out	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
shirt	1
the	1
servant	1
came	1
back	1
everything	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
it	1
was	1
sunday	1
they	1
sent	1
to	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
shirt	1
it	1
was	1
impossibly	1
wide	1
and	1
short	1
they	1
sent	1
finally	1
to	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
to	1
unpack	1
the	1
things	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
was	1
expected	1
at	1
the	1
church	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
room	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
in	1
a	1
cage	1
peeping	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
and	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
despair	1
recalling	1
what	1
absurd	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
kitty	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
thinking	1
now	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
guilty	1
kouzma	1
flew	1
panting	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
shirt	1
only	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
just	1
lifting	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
van	1
said	1
kouzma	1
three	1
minutes	1
later	1
levin	1
ran	1
full	1
speed	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
aggravating	1
his	1
sufferings	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
help	1
matters	1
like	1
this	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
hurrying	1
with	1
more	1
deliberation	1
after	1
him	1
it	1

young	1
eh	1
why	1
my	1
dear	1
soul	1
she	1
looks	1
more	1
dead	1
than	1
alive	1
were	1
the	1
comments	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
when	1
levin	1
meeting	1
his	1
bride	1
in	1
the	1
entrance	1
walked	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
church	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
told	1
his	1
wife	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
delay	1
and	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
whispering	1
it	1
with	1
smiles	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
levin	1
saw	1
nothing	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
bride	1
everyone	1
said	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
looks	1
dreadfully	1
of	1
late	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
nearly	1
so	1
pretty	1
on	1
her	1
wedding	1
day	1
as	1
usual	1
but	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
so	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
hair	1
done	1
up	1
high	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
white	1
veil	1
and	1
white	1
flowers	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
stand	1
up	1
scalloped	1
collar	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
maidenly	1
fashion	1
hid	1
her	1
long	1
neck	1
at	1
the	1
sides	1
and	1
only	1
showed	1
it	1
in	1
front	1
her	1
strikingly	1
slender	1
figure	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
looked	1
better	1
than	1
ever	1
not	1
because	1
these	1
flowers	1
this	1
veil	1

i	1
was	1

up	1
tried	1
to	1

something	1
but	1
could	1
not	1

cried	1
and	1
then	1
laughed	1
unnaturally	1
kitty	1
looked	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
absent	1
eyes	1
as	1
levin	1
meanwhile	1
the	1
officiating	1
clergy	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
their	1
vestments	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
deacon	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
lectern	1
which	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
forepart	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
the	1
priest	1
turned	1
to	1
levin	1
saying	1
something	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
take	1
the	1
bride	1
s	1
hand	1
and	1
lead	1
her	1
up	1
the	1
best	1
man	1
said	1
to	1
levin	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
before	1
levin	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
right	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
begin	1
again	1
because	1
he	1
kept	1
taking	1
kitty	1
by	1
the	1
wrong	1
arm	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
wrong	1
arm	1
till	1
he	1
understood	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
without	1
changing	1
his	1
position	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
bride	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
correct	1
way	1
the	1
priest	1
walked	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
lectern	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
moved	1
after	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
buzz	1
of	1
talk	1
and	1
a	1
rustle	1
of	1
skirts	1
someone	1
stooped	1
down	1
and	1
pulled	1
out	1
the	1
bride	1
s	1
train	1
the	1
church	1
became	1
so	1
still	1
that	1
the	1
drops	1
of	1
wax	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
falling	1
from	1
the	1
candles	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
priest	1
in	1
his	1
ecclesiastical	1
cap	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
silvery	1
gray	1
locks	1
of	1
hair	1
parted	1
behind	1
his	1
ears	1
was	1
fumbling	1
with	1
something	1
at	1
the	1
lectern	1
putting	1
out	1
his	1
little	1
old	1
hands	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
heavy	1
silver	1
vestment	1
with	1
the	1
gold	1
cross	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
approached	1
him	1
cautiously	1
whispered	1
something	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
levin	1
walked	1
back	1
again	1
the	1
priest	1
lighted	1
two	1
candles	1
wreathed	1
with	1
flowers	1
and	1
holding	1
them	1
sideways	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wax	1
dropped	1
slowly	1
from	1
them	1
he	1
turned	1
facing	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
man	1
that	1
had	1
confessed	1
levin	1
he	1
looked	1
with	1
weary	1
and	1
melancholy	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
sighed	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
vestment	1
blessed	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
solicitous	1
tenderness	1
laid	1
the	1
crossed	1
fingers	1
on	1
the	1
bowed	1
head	1
of	1
kitty	1
then	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
candles	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
censer	1
moved	1
slowly	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
true	1
thought	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
bride	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
profile	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
quiver	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
eyelashes	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
her	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round	1
but	1
the	1
high	1
scalloped	1
collar	1
that	1
reached	1
her	1
little	1
pink	1
ear	1
trembled	1
faintly	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
sigh	1
was	1
held	1
back	1
in	1
her	1
throat	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
glove	1
shook	1
as	1
it	1
held	1
the	1
candle	1
all	1
the	1
fuss	1
of	1
the	1
shirt	1
of	1
being	1
late	1
all	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
their	1
annoyance	1
his	1
ludicrous	1
position	1
all	1
suddenly	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
dread	1
the	1
handsome	1
stately	1
head	1
deacon	1
wearing	1
a	1
silver	1
robe	1
and	1
his	1
curly	1
locks	1
standing	1
out	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
stepped	1
smartly	1
forward	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
stole	1
on	1
two	1
fingers	1
stood	1
opposite	1
the	1
priest	1
blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
lord	1
the	1
solemn	1
syllables	1
rang	1
out	1
slowly	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
setting	1
the	1
air	1
quivering	1
with	1
waves	1
of	1
sound	1
blessed	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
god	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
is	1
now	1
and	1
ever	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
priest	1
answered	1
in	1
a	1
submissive	1
piping	1
voice	1
still	1
fingering	1
something	1
at	1
the	1
lectern	1
and	1
the	1
full	1
chorus	1
of	1
the	1
unseen	1
choir	1
rose	1
up	1
filling	1
the	1
whole	1
church	1
from	1
the	1
windows	1
to	1
the	1
vaulted	1
roof	1
with	1
broad	1
waves	1
of	1
melody	1
it	1
grew	1
stronger	1
rested	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
slowly	1
died	1
away	1
they	1
prayed	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
do	1
for	1
peace	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
and	1
for	1
salvation	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
synod	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
tsar	1
they	1
prayed	1
too	1
for	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
god	1
konstantin	1
and	1
ekaterina	1
now	1
plighting	1
their	1
troth	1
vouchsafe	1
to	1
them	1
love	1
made	1
perfect	1
peace	1
and	1
help	1
o	1
lord	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee	1
the	1
whole	1
church	1
seemed	1
to	1
breathe	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
deacon	1
levin	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
they	1
impressed	1
him	1
how	1
did	1
they	1
guess	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
help	1
just	1
help	1
that	1
one	1
wants	1
he	1
thought	1
recalling	1
all	1
his	1
fears	1
and	1
doubts	1
of	1
late	1
what	1
do	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
can	1
i	1
do	1
in	1
this	1
fearful	1
business	1
he	1
thought	1
without	1
help	1
yes	1
it	1
is	1
help	1
i	1
want	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
deacon	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
imperial	1
family	1
the	1
priest	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
eternal	1
god	1
that	1
joinest	1
together	1
in	1
love	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
separate	1
he	1
read	1
in	1
a	1
gentle	1
piping	1
voice	1
who	1
hast	1
ordained	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
holy	1
wedlock	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
set	1
asunder	1
thou	1
who	1
didst	1
bless	1
isaac	1
and	1
rebecca	1
and	1
their	1
descendants	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
holy	1
covenant	1

thy	1

them	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
all	1

for	1
gracious	1

thou	1

the	1
unseen	1
choir	1
sent	1
rolling	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
air	1
joinest	1
together	1
in	1
love	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
separate	1
what	1
deep	1
meaning	1
in	1
those	1
words	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
correspond	1
with	1
what	1
one	1
feels	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
thought	1
levin	1
is	1
she	1
feeling	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
i	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
he	1
met	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
expression	1
he	1
concluded	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
understanding	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
mistake	1
she	1
almost	1
completely	1
missed	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
them	1
in	1
fact	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
in	1
so	1
strong	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
feeling	1
that	1
filled	1
her	1
breast	1
and	1
grew	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger	1
that	1
feeling	1
was	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
the	1
process	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
month	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
had	1
during	1
those	1
six	1
weeks	1
been	1
a	1
joy	1
and	1
a	1
torture	1
to	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
arbaty	1
street	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
brown	1
dress	1
and	1
given	1
herself	1
to	1
him	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
at	1
that	1
hour	1
there	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
a	1
complete	1
severance	1
from	1
all	1
her	1
old	1
life	1
and	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
new	1
utterly	1
strange	1
life	1
had	1
begun	1
for	1
her	1
while	1
the	1
old	1
life	1
was	1
actually	1
going	1
on	1
as	1
before	1
those	1
six	1
weeks	1
had	1
for	1
her	1
been	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
bliss	1
and	1
the	1
utmost	1
misery	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
all	1
her	1
desires	1
and	1
hopes	1
were	1
concentrated	1
on	1
this	1
one	1
man	1
still	1
uncomprehended	1
by	1
her	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
bound	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
alternate	1
attraction	1
and	1
repulsion	1
even	1
less	1
comprehended	1
than	1
the	1
man	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
outward	1
conditions	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
life	1
living	1
the	1
old	1
life	1
she	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
herself	1
at	1
her	1
utter	1
insurmountable	1
callousness	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
past	1
to	1
things	1
to	1
habits	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
she	1
had	1
loved	1
who	1
loved	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
who	1
was	1
wounded	1
by	1
her	1
indifference	1
to	1
her	1
kind	1
tender	1
father	1
till	1
then	1
dearer	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
this	1
indifference	1
at	1
another	1
she	1
rejoiced	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
this	1
indifference	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
frame	1
a	1
thought	1
not	1
a	1
wish	1
apart	1
from	1
life	1
with	1
this	1
man	1
but	1
this	1
new	1
life	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
picture	1
it	1
clearly	1
to	1
herself	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
anticipation	1
the	1
dread	1
and	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
and	1
the	1
unknown	1

now	1
behold	1
anticipation	1
and	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
remorse	1
at	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
life	1
all	1
was	1
ending	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
was	1
beginning	1
this	1
new	1
life	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
have	1
terrors	1
for	1
her	1
inexperience	1
but	1
terrible	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
change	1
had	1
been	1
wrought	1
six	1
weeks	1
before	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
merely	1
the	1
final	1
sanction	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
completed	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
turning	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
lectern	1
the	1
priest	1
with	1
some	1
difficulty	1
took	1
kitty	1
s	1
little	1
ring	1
and	1
asking	1
levin	1
for	1
his	1
hand	1

it	1

putting	1
his	1
big	1
ring	1
on	1
kitty	1
s	1
touchingly	1
weak	1
pink	1
little	1
finger	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
and	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
made	1
some	1
mistake	1
and	1
were	1
corrected	1
by	1
the	1
priest	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
at	1
last	1
having	1
duly	1
performed	1
the	1
ceremony	1
having	1
signed	1
the	1
rings	1
with	1
the	1

the	1

the	1

the	1
little	1
one	1
again	1
they	1
were	1
puzzled	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
rings	1
from	1
hand	1
to	1
hand	1
still	1
without	1
doing	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
dolly	1
tchirikov	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
stepped	1
forward	1
to	1
set	1
them	1

there	1
was	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
hesitation	1
whispering	1
and	1
smiles	1

the	1
expression	1
of	1
solemn	1
emotion	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
betrothed	1

did	1
not	1
change	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
in	1
their	1
perplexity	1
over	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
looked	1
more	1
grave	1
and	1
deeply	1
moved	1
than	1
before	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
stepan	1

during	1
the	1

of	1

in	1
the	1
brilliantly	1
lighted	1
church	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
incessant	1
flow	1
of	1
discreetly	1
subdued	1
talk	1
in	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
gaily	1
dressed	1
women	1

girls	1
and	1
men	1
in	1
white	1
ties	1
frockcoats	1
and	1

the	1
talk	1
was	1
principally	1
kept	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
men	1
while	1
the	1
women	1
were	1
absorbed	1
in	1
watching	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
the	1
ceremony	1
which	1
always	1
means	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
little	1

nearest	1
to	1
the	1

i	1
was	1
married	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
too	1
answered	1
madame	1
korsunskaya	1
and	1
she	1
sighed	1
remembering	1
how	1
charming	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
how	1
absurdly	1
in	1
love	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
and	1
how	1
different	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
now	1

only	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
kitty	1
thinking	1
how	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
stand	1
with	1
count	1
siniavin	1
in	1
kitty	1
s	1
place	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
remind	1
him	1
then	1
of	1
his	1
joke	1

told	1
the	1

maid	1
of	1

madame	1

that	1

meant	1
to	1
put	1
the	1

chignon	1
for	1
luck	1
she	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
worn	1
a	1
chignon	1
answered	1
madame	1
nikolaeva	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
elderly	1
widower	1
she	1
was	1
angling	1
for	1
married	1
her	1
the	1
wedding	1

grandeur	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
darya	1
dmitrievna	1
jestingly	1
assuring	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
going	1
away	1
after	1
the	1
wedding	1
was	1
becoming	1
common	1
because	1
newly	1
married	1
people	1
always	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed	1
of	1
themselves	1
your	1
brother	1
may	1
feel	1
proud	1
of	1
himself	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
marvel	1
of	1
sweetness	1
i	1

you	1
re	1
envious	1
oh	1
i	1
ve	1
got	1
over	1
that	1
darya	1
dmitrievna	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
a	1
melancholy	1
and	1
serious	1
expression	1
suddenly	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
telling	1
his	1

in	1
law	1

joke	1
about	1

the	1
wreath	1

setting	1
straight	1

answered	1
not	1
hearing	1
him	1
what	1
a	1

lost	1
her	1
looks	1
so	1
countess	1

and	1
how	1

behaving	1
it	1

so	1
difficult	1
too	1
to	1

we	1
shall	1
see	1
which	1
of	1
them	1

step	1
on	1
the	1
rug	1
first	1
i	1
warned	1
kitty	1
it	1

you	1
dolly	1
dolly	1
stood	1
beside	1
them	1
she	1
heard	1
them	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
she	1
was	1
deeply	1
moved	1
the	1
tears	1
stood	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
spoken	1
without	1
crying	1
she	1
was	1
rejoicing	1
over	1
kitty	1
and	1
levin	1
going	1
back	1
in	1
thought	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
wedding	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
radiant	1
figure	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
forgot	1
all	1
the	1
present	1
and	1
remembered	1
only	1
her	1
own	1
innocent	1
love	1
she	1
recalled	1
not	1
herself	1
only	1
but	1
all	1
her	1
women	1
friends	1
and	1
acquaintances	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
triumph	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
stood	1
like	1
kitty	1
under	1
the	1
wedding	1
crown	1
with	1
love	1
and	1
hope	1
and	1
dread	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
renouncing	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
stepping	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
mysterious	1
future	1
among	1
the	1
brides	1
that	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
memory	1
she	1
thought	1
too	1
of	1
her	1
darling	1
anna	1
of	1
whose	1
proposed	1
divorce	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
hearing	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
stood	1
just	1
as	1
innocent	1
in	1
orange	1
flowers	1
and	1
bridal	1
veil	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
terribly	1
strange	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
the	1
sisters	1
the	1
women	1
friends	1
and	1
female	1
relations	1
of	1
the	1
bride	1
who	1
were	1
following	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
the	1
ceremony	1
women	1
who	1
were	1
quite	1
strangers	1
mere	1
spectators	1
were	1
watching	1
it	1
excitedly	1
holding	1
their	1
breath	1
in	1
fear	1
of	1
losing	1
a	1
single	1
movement	1
or	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
and	1
angrily	1
not	1
answering	1
often	1
not	1
hearing	1
the	1
remarks	1
of	1
the	1
callous	1
men	1
who	1
kept	1
making	1
joking	1
or	1
irrelevant	1
observations	1
why	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
crying	1

she	1
being	1
married	1
against	1
her	1

the	1
choristers	1
from	1

from	1

going	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
place	1
at	1
once	1
awfully	1

side	1
what	1

what	1
you	1
will	1
we	1
women	1
feel	1
for	1
our	1
sister	1

were	1
the	1
comments	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1

the	1
ceremony	1

piece	1
of	1
pink	1

stuff	1
the	1
choir	1
sang	1
a	1
complicated	1
and	1
elaborate	1
psalm	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
bass	1
and	1
tenor	1
sang	1
responses	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
turning	1
round	1
pointed	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
to	1
the	1
pink	1
silk	1
rug	1
though	1
both	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
the	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
steps	1
first	1
on	1

will	1
be	1
the	1
head	1
of	1

were	1
capable	1
of	1
recollecting	1
it	1
as	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
few	1
steps	1
towards	1
it	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
loud	1
remarks	1

disputes	1
that	1

stepped	1
on	1
first	1

had	1
stepped	1
on	1
together	1
after	1
the	1
customary	1
questions	1
whether	1
they	1
desired	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
matrimony	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
pledged	1
to	1
anyone	1
else	1
and	1
their	1
answers	1
which	1
sounded	1
strange	1
to	1
themselves	1
a	1
new	1
ceremony	1
began	1
kitty	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prayer	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
their	1
meaning	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
triumph	1
and	1
radiant	1
happiness	1
flooded	1
her	1
soul	1

more	1
as	1
the	1
ceremony	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
deprived	1
her	1
of	1
all	1
power	1
of	1
attention	1
they	1
prayed	1
endow	1
them	1
with	1
continence	1
and	1
fruitfulness	1
and	1
vouchsafe	1
that	1
their	1
hearts	1
may	1
rejoice	1
looking	1
upon	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1

alluded	1
to	1
god	1

creation	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
from	1
adam	1
s	1
rib	1
and	1
for	1
this	1

a	1
man	1
shall	1
leave	1
father	1

cleave	1
unto	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
mystery	1
they	1
prayed	1
that	1
god	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
fruitful	1
and	1
bless	1
them	1
like	1
isaac	1
and	1
rebecca	1
joseph	1

just	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
and	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
unconsciously	1
reflected	1
in	1
everyone	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
beamed	1
on	1
her	1
radiant	1
face	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
quite	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
urging	1
when	1
the	1
priest	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
wedding	1
crowns	1
and	1
shtcherbatsky	1
his	1
hand	1
shaking	1
in	1
its	1
three	1

held	1
the	1
crown	1

above	1
her	1

put	1
it	1
on	1
she	1
whispered	1
smiling	1
levin	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
joyful	1
radiance	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
her	1
feeling	1
infected	1
him	1
he	1
too	1
like	1
her	1
felt	1
glad	1
and	1
happy	1
they	1
enjoyed	1
hearing	1
the	1
epistle	1
read	1
and	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
deacon	1
s	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
verse	1
awaited	1
with	1
such	1
impatience	1
by	1
the	1
outside	1
public	1
they	1
enjoyed	1
drinking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shallow	1
cup	1
of	1
warm	1
red	1
wine	1
and	1
water	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
more	1
pleased	1
when	1
the	1
priest	1
flinging	1
back	1
his	1
stole	1
and	1
taking	1
both	1
their	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
led	1

round	1
the	1
lectern	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
bass	1
voices	1
chanting	1
glory	1
to	1
god	1
shtcherbatsky	1
and	1
tchirikov	1
supporting	1
the	1

and	1
seeming	1
delighted	1
at	1
something	1

at	1
one	1
moment	1
left	1
behind	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
treading	1
on	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
as	1
the	1
priest	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
halt	1
the	1
spark	1
of	1
joy	1
kindled	1
in	1
kitty	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
infected	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
that	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
deacon	1
too	1
wanted	1
to	1
smile	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
taking	1
the	1
crowns	1
off	1
their	1
heads	1
the	1
priest	1
read	1
the	1
last	1
prayer	1
and	1
congratulated	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
levin	1
looked	1
at	1
kitty	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
her	1
look	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
she	1
was	1
charming	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
radiance	1
of	1
happiness	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
levin	1
longed	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
priest	1
got	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
difficulty	1
he	1
smiled	1
his	1
kindly	1
smile	1
and	1
said	1
gently	1
kiss	1
your	1
wife	1
and	1
you	1
kiss	1
your	1
husband	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
candles	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
levin	1
kissed	1
her	1
smiling	1
lips	1
with	1
timid	1
care	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
strange	1
sense	1
of	1
closeness	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
their	1
wondering	1
and	1
timid	1
eyes	1
met	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
it	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
one	1
after	1
supper	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
left	1
for	1

chapter	1
7	1
vronsky	1
and	1
anna	1
had	1
been	1
traveling	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
together	1
in	1
europe	1
they	1
had	1
visited	1
venice	1
rome	1
and	1
naples	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
italian	1
town	1
where	1
they	1
meant	1
to	1
stay	1
some	1
time	1
a	1
handsome	1
head	1
waiter	1
with	1
thick	1
pomaded	1
hair	1
parted	1
from	1
the	1
neck	1
upwards	1
an	1
evening	1
coat	1
a	1
broad	1
white	1
cambric	1
shirt	1
front	1
and	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
trinkets	1
hanging	1
above	1
his	1
rounded	1
stomach	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
curve	1
of	1
his	1
pockets	1
looking	1
contemptuously	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
eyelids	1
while	1
he	1
gave	1
some	1
frigid	1
reply	1
to	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
stopped	1
him	1
catching	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
entry	1
towards	1
the	1
staircase	1
the	1
head	1
waiter	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
russian	1
count	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
their	1
best	1
rooms	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
hands	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pockets	1
deferentially	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
courier	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
business	1
about	1
the	1
palazzo	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
the	1
steward	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
sign	1
the	1
agreement	1
ah	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
said	1
vronsky	1
is	1
madame	1
at	1
home	1
or	1
not	1
madame	1
has	1
been	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
but	1
has	1
returned	1
now	1
answered	1
the	1
waiter	1
vronsky	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
soft	1
wide	1
brimmed	1
hat	1
and	1
passed	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
over	1
his	1
heated	1
brow	1
and	1
hair	1
which	1
had	1
grown	1
half	1
over	1
his	1
ears	1
and	1
was	1
brushed	1
back	1
covering	1
the	1
bald	1
patch	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
glancing	1
casually	1
at	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
still	1
stood	1
there	1
gazing	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
this	1
gentleman	1
is	1
a	1
russian	1
and	1
was	1
inquiring	1
after	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
head	1
waiter	1
with	1
mingled	1
feelings	1
of	1
annoyance	1
at	1
never	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
acquaintances	1
anywhere	1
and	1
longing	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
diversion	1
from	1
the	1
monotony	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
vronsky	1
looked	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
retreated	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
again	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
light	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
both	1
golenishtchev	1
vronsky	1
it	1
really	1
was	1
golenishtchev	1
a	1
comrade	1
of	1
vronsky	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
corps	1
of	1
pages	1
in	1
the	1
corps	1
golenishtchev	1
had	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
liberal	1
party	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
corps	1
without	1
entering	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
taken	1
office	1
under	1
the	1
government	1
vronsky	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
completely	1
different	1
ways	1
on	1
leaving	1
the	1
corps	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
met	1
once	1
since	1
at	1
that	1
meeting	1
vronsky	1
perceived	1
that	1
golenishtchev	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
lofty	1
intellectually	1
liberal	1
line	1
and	1
was	1
consequently	1
disposed	1
to	1
look	1
down	1
upon	1
vronsky	1
s	1
interests	1
and	1
calling	1
in	1
life	1
hence	1
vronsky	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
chilling	1
and	1
haughty	1
manner	1
he	1
so	1
well	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
assume	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
you	1
may	1
like	1
or	1
dislike	1
my	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
treat	1
me	1
with	1
respect	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
me	1
golenishtchev	1
had	1
been	1
contemptuously	1
indifferent	1
to	1
the	1
tone	1
taken	1
by	1
vronsky	1
this	1
second	1
meeting	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
supposed	1
to	1
estrange	1
them	1
still	1
more	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
beamed	1
and	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
delight	1
on	1
recognizing	1
one	1
another	1
vronsky	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
golenishtchev	1
but	1
probably	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
himself	1
aware	1
how	1
bored	1
he	1
was	1
he	1
forgot	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
of	1
their	1
last	1
meeting	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
frank	1
delight	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
comrade	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
delight	1
replaced	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
uneasiness	1
on	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
face	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
said	1
vronsky	1
showing	1
his	1
strong	1
white	1
teeth	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
smile	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
name	1
vronsky	1
but	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
which	1
one	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
in	1
come	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
re	1
doing	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
living	1
here	1
for	1
two	1
years	1
i	1
m	1
working	1
ah	1
said	1
vronsky	1
with	1
sympathy	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
habit	1
common	1
with	1
russians	1
instead	1
of	1
saying	1
in	1
russian	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
keep	1
from	1
the	1
servants	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
french	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
madame	1
karenina	1
we	1
are	1
traveling	1
together	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
now	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
french	1
carefully	1
scrutinizing	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
face	1
ah	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
know	1
golenishtchev	1
answered	1
carelessly	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
he	1
added	1
four	1
days	1
vronsky	1
answered	1
once	1
more	1
scrutinizing	1
his	1
friend	1
s	1
face	1
intently	1
yes	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
decent	1
fellow	1
and	1
will	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
thing	1
properly	1
vronsky	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
catching	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
subject	1
i	1
can	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
anna	1
he	1
looks	1
at	1
it	1
properly	1
during	1
those	1
three	1
months	1
that	1
vronsky	1
had	1
spent	1
abroad	1
with	1
anna	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
on	1
meeting	1
new	1
people	1
asked	1
himself	1
how	1
the	1
new	1
person	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
anna	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
in	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
proper	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
properly	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
exactly	1
how	1
they	1
did	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
greatly	1
puzzled	1
to	1
answer	1
in	1
reality	1
those	1
who	1
in	1
vronsky	1
s	1
opinion	1
had	1
the	1
proper	1
view	1
had	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
view	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
behaved	1
in	1
general	1
as	1
well	1
bred	1
persons	1
do	1
behave	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
complex	1
and	1
insoluble	1
problems	1
with	1
which	1
life	1
is	1
encompassed	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
they	1
behaved	1
with	1
propriety	1
avoiding	1
allusions	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
questions	1
they	1
assumed	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
fully	1
comprehending	1
the	1
import	1
and	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
accepting	1
and	1
even	1
approving	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
of	1
considering	1
it	1
superfluous	1
and	1
uncalled	1
for	1
to	1
put	1
all	1
this	1
into	1
words	1
vronsky	1
at	1
once	1
divined	1
that	1
golenishtchev	1
was	1
of	1
this	1
class	1
and	1
therefore	1
was	1
doubly	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
manner	1
to	1
madame	1
karenina	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
her	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
vronsky	1
could	1
have	1
desired	1
obviously	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
effort	1
he	1
steered	1
clear	1
of	1
all	1
subjects	1
which	1
might	1
lead	1
to	1
embarrassment	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
anna	1
before	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
frankness	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
accepted	1
her	1
position	1
she	1
blushed	1
when	1
vronsky	1
brought	1
in	1
golenishtchev	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
extremely	1
charmed	1
by	1
this	1
childish	1
blush	1
overspreading	1
her	1
candid	1
and	1
handsome	1
face	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
liked	1
particularly	1
was	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
though	1
on	1
purpose	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
no	1
misunderstanding	1
with	1
an	1
outsider	1
she	1
called	1
vronsky	1
simply	1
alexey	1
and	1
said	1
they	1
were	1
moving	1
into	1
a	1
house	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
taken	1
what	1
was	1
here	1
called	1
a	1
palazzo	1
golenishtchev	1
liked	1
this	1
direct	1
and	1
simple	1
attitude	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
looking	1
at	1
anna	1
s	1
manner	1
of	1
simple	1
hearted	1
spirited	1
gaiety	1
and	1
knowing	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
vronsky	1
golenishtchev	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
her	1
perfectly	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
having	1
made	1
her	1
husband	1
wretched	1
having	1
abandoned	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
lost	1
her	1
good	1
name	1
she	1
yet	1
felt	1
full	1
of	1
spirits	1
gaiety	1
and	1
happiness	1
it	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
guide	1
book	1
said	1
golenishtchev	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
palazzo	1
vronsky	1
had	1
taken	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
first	1
rate	1
tintoretto	1
there	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
latest	1
period	1

a	1
lovely	1
day	1

and	1

at	1

vronsky	1
addressing	1
anna	1
i	1

be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
i	1

go	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
hat	1
would	1
you	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
hot	1
she	1
said	1
stopping	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
and	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
vronsky	1
and	1
again	1
a	1
vivid	1
flush	1
overspread	1
her	1
face	1
vronsky	1
saw	1
from	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
on	1
what	1
terms	1
he	1
cared	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
golenishtchev	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
not	1
behaving	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
wish	1
he	1
looked	1
a	1
long	1
tender	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
no	1
not	1
very	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
everything	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
smiling	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
walked	1
with	1
her	1
rapid	1
step	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
friends	1
glanced	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
hesitation	1
came	1
into	1
both	1
faces	1
as	1
though	1
golenishtchev	1
unmistakably	1
admiring	1
her	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
to	1
say	1
while	1
vronsky	1
desired	1
and	1
dreaded	1
his	1
doing	1
so	1
well	1
then	1
vronsky	1
began	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
so	1
you	1
re	1
settled	1
here	1
you	1
re	1
still	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
work	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
recalling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
golenishtchev	1
was	1
writing	1
something	1
yes	1
i	1
m	1
writing	1
the	1
second	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
elements	1
said	1
golenishtchev	1
coloring	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
exact	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
writing	1
it	1
yet	1
i	1
am	1
preparing	1
collecting	1
materials	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
far	1
wider	1
scope	1
and	1
will	1
touch	1
on	1
almost	1
all	1
questions	1
we	1
in	1
russia	1
refuse	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
heirs	1
of	1
byzantium	1
and	1
he	1
launched	1
into	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
heated	1
explanation	1
of	1
his	1
views	1
vronsky	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
felt	1
embarrassed	1
at	1
not	1
even	1
knowing	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
elements	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
author	1
spoke	1
as	1
something	1
well	1
known	1
but	1
as	1
golenishtchev	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
his	1
opinions	1
and	1
vronsky	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
even	1
without	1
knowing	1
the	1
two	1
elements	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
some	1
interest	1
for	1
golenishtchev	1
spoke	1
well	1
but	1
vronsky	1
was	1
startled	1
and	1
annoyed	1
by	1
the	1
nervous	1
irascibility	1
with	1
which	1
golenishtchev	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
engrossed	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
his	1
eyes	1
glittered	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
angrily	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
hurried	1
in	1
his	1
replies	1
to	1
imaginary	1
opponents	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
excited	1
and	1
worried	1
remembering	1
golenishtchev	1
a	1
thin	1
lively	1
good	1
natured	1
and	1
well	1
bred	1
boy	1
always	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
class	1
vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
irritability	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
what	1
he	1
particularly	1
disliked	1
was	1
that	1
golenishtchev	1
a	1
man	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
good	1
set	1
should	1
put	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
some	1
scribbling	1
fellows	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
irritated	1
and	1
angry	1
was	1
it	1
worth	1
it	1
vronsky	1
disliked	1
it	1
yet	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
golenishtchev	1
was	1
unhappy	1
and	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
unhappiness	1
almost	1
mental	1
derangement	1
was	1
visible	1
on	1
his	1
mobile	1
rather	1
handsome	1
face	1
while	1
without	1
even	1
noticing	1
anna	1
s	1
coming	1
in	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
hotly	1
expressing	1
his	1
views	1
when	1
anna	1
came	1
in	1
in	1
her	1
hat	1
and	1
cape	1
and	1
her	1
lovely	1
hand	1
rapidly	1
swinging	1
her	1
parasol	1
and	1
stood	1
beside	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
relief	1
that	1
vronsky	1
broke	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
plaintive	1
eyes	1
of	1
golenishtchev	1
which	1
fastened	1
persistently	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
fresh	1
rush	1
of	1
love	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
charming	1
companion	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
happiness	1
golenishtchev	1
recovered	1
himself	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
dejected	1
and	1
gloomy	1
but	1
anna	1
disposed	1
to	1
feel	1
friendly	1
with	1
everyone	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
soon	1
revived	1
his	1
spirits	1
by	1
her	1
direct	1
and	1
lively	1
manner	1
after	1
trying	1
various	1
subjects	1
of	1
conversation	1
she	1
got	1
him	1
upon	1
painting	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
talked	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
attentively	1
they	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
and	1
looked	1
over	1
it	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
one	1
thing	1
said	1
anna	1
to	1
golenishtchev	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
back	1
alexey	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
capital	1
atelier	1
you	1
must	1
certainly	1
take	1
that	1
room	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
vronsky	1
in	1
russian	1
using	1
the	1
affectionately	1
familiar	1
form	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
golenishtchev	1
would	1
become	1
intimate	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
isolation	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
reserve	1
before	1
him	1
do	1
you	1
paint	1
said	1
golenishtchev	1
turning	1
round	1
quickly	1
to	1
vronsky	1
yes	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
study	1
long	1
ago	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
little	1
said	1
vronsky	1
reddening	1
he	1
has	1
great	1
talent	1
said	1
anna	1
with	1
a	1
delighted	1
smile	1
i	1
m	1
no	1
judge	1
of	1
course	1
but	1
good	1
judges	1
have	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
chapter	1
8	1
anna	1
in	1
that	1
first	1
period	1
of	1
her	1
emancipation	1
and	1
rapid	1
return	1
to	1
health	1
felt	1
herself	1
unpardonably	1
happy	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
life	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
unhappiness	1
did	1
not	1
poison	1
her	1
happiness	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
that	1
memory	1
was	1
too	1
awful	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
unhappiness	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
too	1
much	1
happiness	1
to	1
be	1
regretted	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
after	1
her	1
illness	1
her	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
its	1
breakdown	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
vronsky	1
s	1
wound	1
his	1
visit	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
divorce	1
the	1
departure	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
house	1
the	1
parting	1
from	1
her	1
son	1
all	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
delirious	1
dream	1
from	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
waked	1
up	1
alone	1
with	1
vronsky	1
abroad	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
harm	1
caused	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
aroused	1
in	1
her	1
a	1
feeling	1
like	1
repulsion	1
and	1
akin	1
to	1
what	1
a	1
drowning	1
man	1
might	1
feel	1
who	1
has	1
shaken	1
off	1
another	1
man	1
clinging	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
man	1
did	1
drown	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
evil	1
action	1
of	1
course	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
sole	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
and	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
brood	1
over	1
these	1
fearful	1
facts	1
one	1
consolatory	1
reflection	1
upon	1
her	1
conduct	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
final	1
rupture	1
and	1
when	1
now	1
she	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
past	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
one	1
reflection	1
i	1
have	1
inevitably	1
made	1
that	1
man	1
wretched	1
she	1
thought	1
but	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
his	1
misery	1
i	1
too	1
am	1
suffering	1
and	1
shall	1
suffer	1
i	1
am	1
losing	1
what	1
i	1
prized	1
above	1
everything	1
i	1
am	1
losing	1
my	1
good	1
name	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
wrong	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
happiness	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
shall	1
suffer	1
from	1
my	1
shame	1
and	1
the	1
separation	1
from	1
my	1
child	1
but	1
however	1
sincerely	1
anna	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
suffer	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
suffering	1
shame	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
tact	1
of	1
which	1
both	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
large	1
share	1
they	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
avoiding	1
russian	1
ladies	1
abroad	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
never	1
placed	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
false	1
position	1
and	1
everywhere	1
they	1
had	1
met	1
people	1
who	1
pretended	1
that	1
they	1
perfectly	1
understood	1
their	1
position	1
far	1
better	1
indeed	1
than	1
they	1
did	1
themselves	1
separation	1
from	1
the	1
son	1
she	1
loved	1
even	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
her	1
anguish	1
in	1
these	1
early	1
days	1
the	1
baby	1
girl	1
his	1
child	1
was	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
had	1
so	1
won	1
anna	1
s	1
heart	1
since	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
her	1
that	1
anna	1
rarely	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
the	1
desire	1
for	1
life	1
waxing	1
stronger	1
with	1
recovered	1
health	1
was	1
so	1
intense	1
and	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
were	1
so	1
new	1
and	1
pleasant	1
that	1
anna	1
felt	1
unpardonably	1
happy	1
the	1
more	1
she	1
got	1
to	1
know	1
vronsky	1
the	1
more	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
her	1
complete	1
ownership	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
continual	1
joy	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
presence	1
was	1
always	1
sweet	1
to	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
traits	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
which	1
she	1
learned	1
to	1
know	1
better	1
and	1
better	1
were	1
unutterably	1
dear	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
appearance	1
changed	1
by	1
his	1
civilian	1
dress	1
was	1
as	1
fascinating	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
some	1
young	1
girl	1
in	1
love	1
in	1
everything	1
he	1
said	1
thought	1
and	1
did	1
she	1
saw	1
something	1
particularly	1
noble	1
and	1
elevated	1
her	1
adoration	1
of	1
him	1
alarmed	1
her	1
indeed	1
she	1
sought	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
anything	1
not	1
fine	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
show	1
him	1
her	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
insignificance	1
beside	1
him	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
knowing	1
this	1
he	1
might	1
sooner	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
dreaded	1
nothing	1
now	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
losing	1
his	1
love	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
grounds	1
for	1
fearing	1
it	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
grateful	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
showing	1
that	1
she	1
appreciated	1
it	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
such	1
a	1
marked	1
aptitude	1
for	1
a	1
political	1
career	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
certain	1
to	1
play	1
a	1
leading	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
sacrificed	1
his	1
ambition	1
for	1
her	1
sake	1
and	1
never	1
betrayed	1
the	1
slightest	1
regret	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
lovingly	1
respectful	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
the	1
constant	1
care	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
never	1
deserted	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
he	1
so	1
manly	1
a	1
man	1
never	1
opposed	1
her	1
had	1
indeed	1
with	1
her	1
no	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
was	1
anxious	1
it	1
seemed	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
anticipate	1
her	1
wishes	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
appreciate	1
this	1
even	1
though	1
the	1
very	1
intensity	1
of	1
his	1
solicitude	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
care	1
with	1
which	1

of	1
what	1

he	1
soon	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

gave	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
sand	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
happiness	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
it	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
mistake	1
men	1
make	1
in	1
picturing	1
to	1
themselves	1
happiness	1
as	1
the	1
realization	1
of	1
their	1
desires	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
after	1
joining	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
hers	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
civilian	1
dress	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
freedom	1
in	1
general	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
nothing	1
before	1
and	1
of	1
freedom	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
content	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
long	1
he	1
was	1
soon	1
aware	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
springing	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
a	1
desire	1
for	1
desires	1
ennui	1
without	1
conscious	1
intention	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
clutch	1
at	1
every	1
passing	1
caprice	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
desire	1
and	1
an	1
object	1
sixteen	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
must	1
be	1
occupied	1
in	1
some	1
way	1

were	1
living	1
abroad	1
in	1
complete	1
freedom	1
outside	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1

filled	1
up	1

in	1

with	1

on	1
previous	1
tours	1
abroad	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
since	1
the	1
sole	1
attempt	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
had	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
sudden	1
attack	1
of	1
depression	1

of	1
the	1

foreign	1
and	1
russian	1
were	1
equally	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
irregularity	1
of	1
their	1
position	1
the	1
inspection	1
of	1
objects	1
of	1
interest	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1

that	1

first	1
at	1

then	1
at	1

then	1
at	1

as	1
he	1
had	1
from	1
a	1

a	1
taste	1
for	1

on	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
collecting	1

he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1

at	1

began	1
to	1
take	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
concentrated	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
unoccupied	1
mass	1
of	1
desires	1
which	1
demanded	1
satisfaction	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
ready	1
appreciation	1
of	1
art	1
and	1
probably	1
with	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
imitating	1
art	1
he	1
supposed	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
real	1
thing	1
essential	1
for	1
an	1
artist	1
and	1
after	1
hesitating	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
which	1
style	1
of	1
painting	1
to	1
select	1
religious	1
historical	1
realistic	1
or	1
genre	1
painting	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
to	1

appreciated	1
all	1
kinds	1
and	1
could	1
have	1
felt	1
inspired	1
by	1
anyone	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
knowing	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
any	1
school	1
of	1
painting	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
inspired	1
directly	1
by	1
what	1
is	1
within	1
the	1
soul	1
without	1
caring	1
whether	1
what	1
is	1
painted	1
will	1
belong	1
to	1
any	1
recognized	1
school	1
since	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
drew	1
his	1
inspiration	1
not	1
directly	1
from	1
life	1
but	1
indirectly	1
from	1
life	1
embodied	1
in	1

his	1

came	1
very	1

easily	1

easily	1
came	1
his	1
success	1
in	1

something	1
very	1
similar	1

of	1

more	1

in	1
that	1

not	1

it	1
s	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
wrong	1

it	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
ivanov	1

school	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

having	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
favorite	1
theories	1
golenishtchev	1
launched	1
forth	1
into	1
a	1
disquisition	1
on	1
it	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
how	1
they	1
can	1
fall	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
gross	1
mistake	1
christ	1
always	1
has	1
his	1
definite	1
embodiment	1
in	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
masters	1
and	1
therefore	1
if	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
depict	1
not	1
god	1
but	1
a	1
revolutionist	1
or	1
a	1
sage	1
let	1
them	1
take	1
from	1
history	1
a	1
socrates	1
a	1
franklin	1
a	1
charlotte	1
corday	1
but	1
not	1
christ	1
they	1
take	1
the	1
very	1
figure	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
taken	1
for	1
their	1
art	1
and	1
then	1
and	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
this	1
mihailov	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
poverty	1
asked	1
vronsky	1
thinking	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
russian	1
mæcenas	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
assist	1
the	1
artist	1
regardless	1
of	1
whether	1
the	1
picture	1
were	1
good	1
or	1
bad	1
i	1
should	1
say	1
not	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
remarkable	1
portrait	1
painter	1
have	1
you	1
ever	1
seen	1
his	1
portrait	1
of	1
madame	1
vassiltchikova	1
but	1
i	1
believe	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
care	1
about	1
painting	1
any	1
more	1
portraits	1
and	1
so	1
very	1
likely	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
want	1
i	1
maintain	1
that	1
couldn	1
t	1
we	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
paint	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
said	1
vronsky	1
why	1
mine	1
said	1
anna	1
after	1
yours	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
another	1
portrait	1
better	1
have	1
one	1
of	1
annie	1
so	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
baby	1
girl	1
here	1
she	1
is	1
she	1
added	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
handsome	1
italian	1
nurse	1
who	1
was	1
carrying	1
the	1
child	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
immediately	1
glancing	1
unnoticed	1
at	1
vronsky	1
the	1
handsome	1
nurse	1
from	1
whom	1
vronsky	1
was	1
painting	1
a	1
head	1
for	1
his	1
picture	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
hidden	1
grief	1
in	1
anna	1
s	1
life	1
he	1
painted	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
model	1
admired	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
mediævalism	1
and	1
anna	1
dared	1
not	1
confess	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
becoming	1
jealous	1
of	1
this	1
nurse	1
and	1
was	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
particularly	1
gracious	1
and	1
condescending	1
both	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
little	1
son	1
vronsky	1
too	1
glanced	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
into	1
anna	1
s	1
eyes	1
and	1
turning	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
golenishtchev	1
he	1
said	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
this	1
mihailov	1
i	1
have	1
met	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
queer	1
fish	1
and	1
quite	1
without	1
breeding	1
you	1
know	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
uncouth	1

people	1
one	1
s	1
so	1
often	1
coming	1
across	1
nowadays	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
free	1
thinkers	1
you	1

who	1
are	1
reared	1
d	1
emblée	1
in	1
theories	1
of	1
atheism	1
scepticism	1
and	1
materialism	1
in	1
former	1
days	1
said	1
golenishtchev	1
not	1
observing	1
or	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
both	1
anna	1
and	1
vronsky	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
former	1
days	1
the	1
free	1
thinker	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
ideas	1
of	1
religion	1
law	1
and	1
morality	1
and	1
only	1
through	1
conflict	1
and	1
struggle	1
came	1
to	1
free	1
thought	1
but	1
now	1
there	1
has	1
sprung	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
type	1
of	1
born	1
free	1
thinkers	1
who	1
grow	1
up	1
without	1
even	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
principles	1
of	1
morality	1
or	1
of	1
religion	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
authorities	1
who	1
grow	1
up	1
directly	1
in	1
ideas	1
of	1
negation	1

has	1
never	1

any	1
sort	1
of	1
bringing	1
up	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
academy	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
reputation	1
he	1
tried	1
as	1
he	1
s	1
no	1
fool	1
to	1
educate	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
very	1
source	1
of	1
culture	1
the	1
magazines	1
in	1
old	1
times	1
you	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
educate	1
himself	1
a	1
frenchman	1
for	1
instance	1
would	1
have	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
study	1
all	1
the	1
classics	1
and	1
theologians	1
and	1
tragedians	1
and	1
historiaris	1
and	1
philosophers	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
intellectual	1
work	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
but	1
in	1
our	1
day	1
he	1
goes	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
literature	1
of	1
negation	1
very	1
quickly	1
assimilates	1
all	1
the	1
extracts	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
negation	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
ready	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
all	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
in	1
that	1
literature	1
traces	1
of	1
conflict	1
with	1
authorities	1
with	1
the	1
creeds	1
of	1
the	1
ages	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
perceived	1
from	1
this	1
conflict	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
else	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
comes	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
literature	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
creeds	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
furnish	1
matter	1
for	1
discussion	1

it	1
is	1
stated	1
baldly	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1

tell	1
you	1
what	1
said	1
anna	1
who	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
been	1
exchanging	1
wary	1
glances	1
with	1
vronsky	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
this	1
artist	1
but	1
was	1
simply	1
absorbed	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
assisting	1
him	1
and	1
ordering	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
resolutely	1
interrupting	1
golenishtchev	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
talking	1
away	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
golenishtchev	1
recovered	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1
and	1
readily	1
agreed	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
artist	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
remote	1
suburb	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
carriage	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
anna	1
with	1
golenishtchev	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
vronsky	1
on	1
the	1
front	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
facing	1
them	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
ugly	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
remote	1
suburb	1
on	1
learning	1
from	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
wife	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
mihailov	1
saw	1
visitors	1
at	1
his	1
studio	1
but	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
lodging	1
only	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
steps	1
off	1
they	1
sent	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
cards	1
asking	1
permission	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
picture	1
chapter	1

the	1
artist	1
mihailov	1
was	1
as	1
always	1
at	1
work	1
when	1
the	1
cards	1
of	1
count	1
vronsky	1
and	1
golenishtchev	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
working	1
in	1
his	1
studio	1
at	1
his	1
big	1
picture	1
on	1
getting	1
home	1
he	1
flew	1
into	1
a	1
rage	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
managed	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
landlady	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
asking	1
for	1
money	1
i	1
ve	1
said	1
it	1
to	1

times	1

explaining	1
things	1
in	1
italian	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
fool	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
foolish	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
dispute	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
it	1
run	1
so	1
long	1
it	1
s	1

had	1
the	1
money	1
leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
mihailov	1
shrieked	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
stopping	1
his	1
ears	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
his	1
working	1
room	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
partition	1
wall	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
him	1
idiotic	1
woman	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
opening	1
a	1
portfolio	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
peculiar	1
fervor	1
at	1
a	1
sketch	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
never	1
did	1
he	1
work	1
with	1
such	1
fervor	1
and	1
success	1
as	1
when	1
things	1
went	1
ill	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
quarreled	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
oh	1
damn	1
them	1
all	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
working	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
sketch	1
for	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
violent	1
rage	1
a	1
sketch	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
before	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
it	1
no	1
that	1
one	1
was	1
better	1
where	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
scowling	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
asked	1
his	1
eldest	1
little	1
girl	1
where	1
was	1
that	1
piece	1
of	1
paper	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
the	1
paper	1
with	1
the	1
discarded	1
sketch	1
on	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
dirty	1
and	1
spotted	1
with	1
candle	1
grease	1
still	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
sketch	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
table	1
and	1
moving	1
a	1
little	1
away	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
gazing	1
at	1
it	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
smiled	1
and	1
gesticulated	1
gleefully	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
picking	1
up	1
the	1
pencil	1
he	1
began	1
rapidly	1
drawing	1
the	1
spot	1
of	1
tallow	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
new	1
pose	1
he	1
had	1
sketched	1
this	1
new	1
pose	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
shopkeeper	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
cigars	1
a	1
vigorous	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
prominent	1
chin	1
and	1
he	1
sketched	1
this	1
very	1
face	1
this	1
chin	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
laughed	1
aloud	1
with	1
delight	1
the	1
figure	1
from	1
a	1
lifeless	1
imagined	1
thing	1
had	1
become	1
living	1
and	1
such	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
changed	1
that	1
figure	1
lived	1
and	1
was	1
clearly	1
and	1
unmistakably	1
defined	1
the	1
sketch	1
might	1
be	1
corrected	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
requirements	1
of	1
the	1
figure	1
the	1
legs	1
indeed	1
could	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
differently	1
and	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
must	1
be	1
quite	1
altered	1
the	1
hair	1
too	1
might	1
be	1
thrown	1
back	1
but	1
in	1
making	1
these	1
corrections	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
altering	1
the	1
figure	1
but	1
simply	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
what	1
concealed	1
the	1
figure	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
stripping	1
off	1
the	1
wrappings	1
which	1
hindered	1
it	1
from	1
being	1
distinctly	1
seen	1
each	1
new	1
feature	1
only	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
whole	1
figure	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
force	1
and	1
vigor	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
suddenly	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
of	1
tallow	1
he	1
was	1
carefully	1
finishing	1
the	1
figure	1
when	1
the	1
cards	1
were	1
brought	1
him	1
coming	1
coming	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
come	1
sasha	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
cross	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
timidly	1
and	1
affectionately	1
at	1
her	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
blame	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
i	1
ll	1
make	1
it	1
all	1
right	1
and	1
having	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
an	1
olive	1
green	1
overcoat	1
with	1
a	1
velvet	1
collar	1
and	1
a	1
hat	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
his	1
studio	1
the	1
successful	1
figure	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
forgotten	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
delighted	1
and	1
excited	1
at	1
the	1
visit	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
of	1
consequence	1
russians	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
their	1
carriage	1
of	1
his	1
picture	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
stood	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
easel	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
one	1
conviction	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
ever	1
painted	1
a	1
picture	1
like	1
it	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
his	1
picture	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
pictures	1
of	1
raphael	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
convey	1
in	1
that	1
picture	1
no	1
one	1
ever	1
had	1
conveyed	1
this	1
he	1
knew	1
positively	1
and	1
had	1
known	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
paint	1
it	1
but	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
criticisms	1
whatever	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
had	1
yet	1
immense	1
consequence	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
they	1
agitated	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
any	1
remark	1
the	1
most	1
insignificant	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
critic	1
saw	1
even	1
the	1
tiniest	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
picture	1
agitated	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
he	1
always	1
attributed	1
to	1
his	1
critics	1
a	1
more	1
profound	1
comprehension	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
and	1
always	1
expected	1
from	1
them	1
something	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
picture	1
and	1
often	1
in	1
their	1
criticisms	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
this	1
he	1
walked	1
rapidly	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
studio	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
excitement	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
soft	1
light	1
on	1
anna	1
s	1
figure	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
entrance	1
listening	1
to	1
golenishtchev	1
who	1
was	1
eagerly	1
telling	1
her	1
something	1
while	1
she	1
evidently	1
wanted	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
artist	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
unconscious	1
how	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
them	1
he	1
seized	1
on	1
this	1
impression	1
and	1
absorbed	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
chin	1
of	1
the	1
shopkeeper	1
who	1
had	1
sold	1
him	1
the	1
cigars	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
away	1
somewhere	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
out	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
it	1
the	1
visitors	1
not	1
agreeably	1
impressed	1
beforehand	1
by	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
artist	1
were	1
still	1
less	1
so	1
by	1
his	1
personal	1
appearance	1
thick	1
set	1
and	1
of	1
middle	1
height	1
with	1
nimble	1
movements	1
with	1
his	1
brown	1
hat	1
olive	1
green	1
coat	1
and	1
narrow	1
trousers	1
though	1
wide	1
trousers	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
in	1
fashion	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
with	1
the	1
ordinariness	1
of	1
his	1
broad	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
combined	1
expression	1
of	1
timidity	1
and	1
anxiety	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
his	1
dignity	1
mihailov	1
made	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
please	1
step	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
indifferent	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
key	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
chapter	1
11	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
studio	1
mihailov	1
once	1
more	1
scanned	1
his	1
visitors	1
and	1
noted	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
vronsky	1
s	1
expression	1
too	1
and	1
especially	1
his	1
jaws	1
although	1
his	1
artistic	1
sense	1
was	1
unceasingly	1
at	1
work	1
collecting	1
materials	1
although	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
continually	1
increasing	1
excitement	1
as	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
criticizing	1
his	1
work	1
drew	1
nearer	1
he	1
rapidly	1
and	1
subtly	1
formed	1
from	1
imperceptible	1
signs	1
a	1
mental	1
image	1
of	1
these	1
three	1
persons	1
that	1
fellow	1
golenishtchev	1
was	1
a	1
russian	1
living	1
here	1
mihailov	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
his	1
surname	1
nor	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
nor	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
only	1
remembered	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
remembered	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
but	1
he	1
remembered	1
too	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
faces	1
laid	1
by	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
in	1
the	1
immense	1
class	1
of	1
the	1
falsely	1
consequential	1
and	1
poor	1
in	1
expression	1
the	1
abundant	1
hair	1
and	1
very	1
open	1
forehead	1
gave	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
consequence	1
to	1
the	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
expression	1
a	1
petty	1
childish	1
peevish	1
expression	1
concentrated	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
the	1
narrow	1
nose	1
vronsky	1
and	1
madame	1
karenina	1
must	1
be	1
mihailov	1
supposed	1
distinguished	1
and	1
wealthy	1
russians	1
knowing	1
nothing	1
about	1
art	1
like	1
all	1
those	1
wealthy	1
russians	1
but	1
posing	1
as	1
amateurs	1
and	1
connoisseurs	1
most	1
likely	1
they	1
ve	1
already	1
looked	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
antiques	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
re	1
making	1
the	1
round	1
of	1
the	1
studios	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
people	1
the	1
german	1
humbug	1
and	1
the	1
cracked	1
pre	1
raphaelite	1
english	1
fellow	1
and	1
have	1
only	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
complete	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
way	1
dilettanti	1
have	1
the	1
cleverer	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
worse	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
contemporary	1
artists	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
object	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
art	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
one	1
sees	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
men	1
the	1
more	1
one	1
sees	1
how	1
inimitable	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
old	1
masters	1
have	1
remained	1
he	1
expected	1
all	1
this	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
all	1
in	1
their	1
faces	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
careless	1
indifference	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
talked	1
among	1
themselves	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
lay	1
figures	1
and	1
busts	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
in	1
leisurely	1
fashion	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
uncover	1
his	1
picture	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
turning	1
over	1
his	1
studies	1
pulling	1
up	1
the	1
blinds	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
the	1
sheet	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
intense	1
excitement	1
especially	1
as	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
all	1
distinguished	1
and	1
wealthy	1
russians	1
were	1
certain	1
to	1
be	1
beasts	1
and	1
fools	1
he	1
liked	1

were	1
beginning	1
to	1
tremble	1
with	1
emotion	1
he	1
moved	1
away	1
and	1
stood	1
behind	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
few	1
seconds	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
visitors	1
were	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
picture	1
in	1
silence	1
mihailov	1
too	1
gazed	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
indifferent	1
eye	1
of	1
an	1
outsider	1
for	1
those	1
few	1
seconds	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
in	1
anticipation	1
that	1
a	1
higher	1
juster	1
criticism	1
would	1
be	1
uttered	1
by	1
them	1
by	1
those	1
very	1
visitors	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
despising	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
he	1
forgot	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
about	1
his	1
picture	1
before	1
during	1
the	1
three	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
painting	1
it	1
he	1
forgot	1
all	1
its	1
qualities	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
picture	1
with	1
their	1
indifferent	1
new	1
outside	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
good	1
in	1
it	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
foreground	1
pilate	1
s	1
irritated	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
serene	1
face	1
of	1
christ	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
pilate	1
s	1
retinue	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
john	1
watching	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
every	1
face	1
that	1
with	1
such	1
agony	1
such	1
blunders	1
and	1
corrections	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
within	1
him	1
with	1
its	1
special	1
character	1
every	1
face	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
such	1
torments	1
and	1
such	1
raptures	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
faces	1
so	1
many	1
times	1
transposed	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
harmony	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
all	1
the	1
shades	1
of	1
color	1
and	1
tones	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
attained	1
with	1
such	1
labor	1
all	1
of	1
this	1
together	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
the	1
merest	1
vulgarity	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
dearest	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
christ	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
such	1
ecstasy	1
as	1
it	1
unfolded	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
utterly	1
lost	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
picture	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
well	1
painted	1
no	1
not	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
distinctly	1
saw	1
now	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
defects	1
repetition	1
of	1
those	1
endless	1
christs	1
of	1
titian	1
raphael	1
rubens	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
soldiers	1
and	1
pilate	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
common	1
poor	1
and	1
stale	1
and	1
positively	1
badly	1
painted	1
weak	1
and	1
unequal	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
repeating	1
hypocritically	1
civil	1
speeches	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
painter	1
and	1
pitying	1
him	1
and	1
laughing	1
at	1
him	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
again	1
the	1
silence	1
though	1
it	1
lasted	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
minute	1
became	1
too	1
intolerable	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
break	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
agitated	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
and	1
addressed	1
golenishtchev	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
ve	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
meeting	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
uneasily	1
first	1
at	1
anna	1
then	1
at	1
vronsky	1
in	1
fear	1
of	1
losing	1
any	1
shade	1
of	1
their	1
expression	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
we	1
met	1
at	1
rossi	1
s	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
at	1
that	1
soirée	1
when	1
that	1
italian	1
lady	1
recited	1
the	1
new	1
rachel	1
golenishtchev	1
answered	1
easily	1
removing	1
his	1
eyes	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
regret	1
from	1
the	1
picture	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
artist	1
noticing	1
however	1
that	1
mihailov	1
was	1
expecting	1
a	1
criticism	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
he	1
said	1
your	1
picture	1
has	1
got	1
on	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
since	1
i	1
saw	1
it	1
last	1
time	1
and	1
what	1
strikes	1
me	1
particularly	1
now	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
pilate	1
one	1
so	1
knows	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
capital	1
fellow	1
but	1
an	1
official	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
s	1
doing	1
but	1
i	1
fancy	1
all	1
mihailov	1
s	1
mobile	1
face	1
beamed	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
for	1
excitement	1
and	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
coughing	1
low	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
opinion	1
of	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
capacity	1
for	1
understanding	1
art	1
trifling	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
true	1
remark	1
upon	1
the	1
fidelity	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
pilate	1
as	1
an	1
official	1
and	1
offensive	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
seemed	1
the	1
utterance	1
of	1
so	1
unimportant	1
an	1
observation	1
while	1
nothing	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
more	1
serious	1
points	1
mihailov	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
ecstasy	1
of	1
delight	1
at	1
this	1
observation	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
thought	1
about	1
pilate	1
s	1
figure	1
just	1
what	1
golenishtchev	1
said	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
this	1
reflection	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
reflections	1
which	1
as	1
mihailov	1
knew	1
for	1
certain	1
would	1
be	1
true	1
did	1
not	1
diminish	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
remark	1
his	1
heart	1
warmed	1
to	1
golenishtchev	1
for	1
this	1
remark	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
depression	1
he	1
suddenly	1
passed	1
to	1
ecstasy	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
picture	1
lived	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
indescribable	1
complexity	1
of	1
everything	1
living	1
mihailov	1
again	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
how	1
he	1
understood	1
pilate	1
but	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
intractably	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
pronounce	1
the	1
words	1
vronsky	1
and	1
anna	1
too	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
that	1
subdued	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
partly	1
to	1
avoid	1
hurting	1
the	1
artist	1
s	1
feelings	1
and	1
partly	1
to	1
avoid	1
saying	1
out	1
loud	1
something	1
silly	1
so	1
easily	1
said	1
when	1
talking	1
of	1
art	1
people	1
usually	1
speak	1
at	1
exhibitions	1
of	1
pictures	1
mihailov	1
fancied	1
that	1
the	1
picture	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
impression	1
on	1
them	1
too	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
how	1
marvelous	1
christ	1
s	1
expression	1
is	1
said	1
anna	1
of	1
all	1
she	1
saw	1
she	1
liked	1
that	1
expression	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
and	1
so	1
praise	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
pleasant	1
to	1
the	1
artist	1
one	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
pitying	1
pilate	1
this	1
again	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
million	1
true	1
reflections	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
picture	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
christ	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pitying	1
pilate	1
in	1
christ	1
s	1
expression	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
indeed	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
pity	1
since	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
love	1
of	1
heavenly	1
peace	1
of	1
readiness	1
for	1
death	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
words	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
an	1
official	1
in	1
pilate	1
and	1
of	1
pity	1
in	1
christ	1
seeing	1
that	1
one	1
is	1
the	1
incarnation	1
of	1
the	1
fleshly	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
spiritual	1
life	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
flashed	1
into	1
mihailov	1
s	1
thoughts	1
yes	1
and	1
how	1
that	1
figure	1
is	1
done	1
what	1
atmosphere	1
one	1
can	1
walk	1
round	1
it	1
said	1
golenishtchev	1
unmistakably	1
betraying	1
by	1
this	1
remark	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
and	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
figure	1
yes	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
wonderful	1
mastery	1
said	1
vronsky	1
how	1
those	1
figures	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
stand	1
out	1
there	1
you	1
have	1
technique	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
golenishtchev	1
alluding	1
to	1
a	1
conversation	1
between	1
them	1
about	1
vronsky	1
s	1
despair	1
of	1
attaining	1
this	1
technique	1
yes	1
yes	1
marvelous	1
golenishtchev	1
and	1
anna	1
assented	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
excited	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
sentence	1
about	1
technique	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1
pang	1
to	1
mihailov	1
s	1
heart	1
and	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
vronsky	1
he	1
suddenly	1
scowled	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
this	1
word	1
technique	1
and	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
understood	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
term	1
was	1
understood	1
a	1
mechanical	1
facility	1
for	1
painting	1
or	1
drawing	1
entirely	1
apart	1
from	1
its	1
subject	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
often	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
actual	1
praise	1
technique	1
was	1
opposed	1
to	1
essential	1
quality	1
as	1
though	1
one	1
could	1
paint	1
well	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
bad	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
attention	1
and	1
care	1
was	1
necessary	1
in	1
taking	1
off	1
the	1
coverings	1
to	1
avoid	1
injuring	1
the	1
creation	1
itself	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
coverings	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
art	1
of	1
painting	1
no	1
technique	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
about	1
it	1
if	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
or	1
to	1
his	1
cook	1
were	1
revealed	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
or	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
peel	1
the	1
wrappings	1
off	1
what	1
was	1
seen	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
experienced	1
and	1
adroit	1
painter	1
could	1
not	1
by	1
mere	1
mechanical	1
facility	1
paint	1
anything	1
if	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
were	1
not	1
revealed	1
to	1
him	1
first	1
besides	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
talking	1
about	1
technique	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
praise	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
painted	1
and	1
repainted	1
he	1
saw	1
faults	1
that	1
hurt	1
his	1
eyes	1
coming	1
from	1
want	1
of	1
care	1
in	1
taking	1
off	1
the	1
wrappings	1
faults	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
correct	1
now	1
without	1
spoiling	1
the	1
whole	1
and	1
in	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
figures	1
and	1
faces	1
he	1
saw	1
too	1
remnants	1
of	1
the	1
wrappings	1
not	1
perfectly	1
removed	1
that	1
spoiled	1
the	1
picture	1
one	1
thing	1
might	1
be	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
remark	1
observed	1
golenishtchev	1
oh	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
said	1
mihailov	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
smile	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
man	1
god	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
god	1
man	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
i	1
cannot	1
paint	1
a	1
christ	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
said	1
mihailov	1
gloomily	1
yes	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
i	1
think	1
your	1
picture	1
is	1
so	1
fine	1
that	1
my	1
observation	1
cannot	1
detract	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
besides	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
my	1
personal	1
opinion	1
with	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
different	1
your	1
very	1
motive	1
is	1
different	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
ivanov	1
i	1
imagine	1
that	1
if	1
christ	1
is	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
an	1
historical	1
character	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
ivanov	1
to	1
select	1
some	1
other	1
historical	1
subject	1
fresh	1
untouched	1
but	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
subject	1
presented	1
to	1
art	1
if	1
one	1
looked	1
one	1
would	1
find	1
others	1
but	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
art	1
cannot	1
suffer	1
doubt	1
and	1
discussion	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
ivanov	1
the	1
question	1
arises	1
for	1
the	1
believer	1
and	1
the	1
unbeliever	1
alike	1
is	1
it	1
god	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
god	1
and	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
is	1
destroyed	1
why	1
so	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
for	1
educated	1
people	1
said	1
mihailov	1
the	1
question	1
cannot	1
exist	1
golenishtchev	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
this	1
and	1
confounded	1
mihailov	1
by	1
his	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
being	1
essential	1
to	1
art	1
mihailov	1
was	1
greatly	1
perturbed	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
in	1
defense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
idea	1
chapter	1

anna	1

vronsky	1

long	1
been	1

glances	1

flow	1
of	1
cleverness	1

oh	1
how	1
exquisite	1
what	1
a	1
lovely	1
thing	1
a	1
gem	1
how	1
exquisite	1
they	1
cried	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
they	1
re	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
thought	1
mihailov	1
he	1
had	1
positively	1
forgotten	1
that	1
picture	1
he	1
had	1
painted	1
three	1
years	1
ago	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
all	1
the	1
agonies	1
and	1
the	1
ecstasies	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
with	1
that	1
picture	1
when	1
for	1
several	1
months	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
one	1
thought	1
haunting	1
him	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
forgot	1
the	1
pictures	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
like	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
expecting	1
an	1
englishman	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
buy	1
it	1
oh	1
that	1
s	1
only	1
an	1
old	1
study	1
he	1
said	1
how	1
fine	1
said	1
golenishtchev	1
he	1
too	1
with	1
unmistakable	1
sincerity	1
falling	1
under	1
the	1
spell	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
two	1
boys	1
were	1
angling	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
a	1
willow	1
tree	1
the	1
elder	1
had	1
just	1
dropped	1
in	1
the	1
hook	1
and	1
was	1
carefully	1
pulling	1
the	1
float	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
bush	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
little	1
younger	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbows	1
with	1
his	1
tangled	1
flaxen	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
his	1
dreamy	1
blue	1
eyes	1
what	1
was	1
he	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
over	1
this	1
picture	1
stirred	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
feeling	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
mihailov	1
but	1
he	1
feared	1
and	1
disliked	1
this	1
waste	1
of	1
feeling	1
for	1
things	1
past	1
and	1
so	1
even	1
though	1
this	1
praise	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
draw	1
his	1
visitors	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
third	1
picture	1
but	1
vronsky	1
asked	1
whether	1
the	1
picture	1
was	1
for	1
sale	1
to	1
mihailov	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
excited	1
by	1
visitors	1
it	1
was	1
extremely	1
distasteful	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
money	1
matters	1
it	1
is	1
put	1
up	1
there	1
to	1
be	1
sold	1
he	1
answered	1
scowling	1
gloomily	1
when	1
the	1
visitors	1
had	1
gone	1
mihailov	1
sat	1
down	1
opposite	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
pilate	1
and	1
christ	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
went	1
over	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
and	1
what	1
though	1
not	1
said	1
had	1
been	1
implied	1
by	1
those	1
visitors	1
and	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
had	1
had	1
such	1
weight	1
with	1
him	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
there	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
mentally	1
put	1
himself	1
at	1
their	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
suddenly	1
lost	1
all	1
importance	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
picture	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
full	1
artist	1
vision	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
in	1
that	1
mood	1
of	1
conviction	1
of	1
the	1
perfectibility	1
and	1
so	1
of	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
picture	1
a	1
conviction	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
intense	1
fervor	1
excluding	1
all	1
other	1
interests	1
in	1
which	1
alone	1
he	1
could	1
work	1
christ	1
s	1
foreshortened	1
leg	1
was	1
not	1
right	1
though	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
palette	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
work	1
as	1
he	1
corrected	1
the	1
leg	1
he	1
looked	1
continually	1
at	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
john	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
which	1
his	1
visitors	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
noticed	1
but	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
beyond	1
perfection	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
leg	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
touch	1
that	1
figure	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
too	1
much	1
excited	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
equally	1
unable	1
to	1
work	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
affected	1
and	1
saw	1
everything	1
too	1
much	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
stage	1
in	1
the	1
transition	1
from	1
coldness	1
to	1
inspiration	1
at	1
which	1
work	1
was	1
possible	1
today	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
agitated	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
covered	1
the	1
picture	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
holding	1
the	1
cloth	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
smiling	1
blissfully	1
gazed	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
at	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
john	1
at	1
last	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
regretfully	1
tearing	1
himself	1
away	1
he	1
dropped	1
the	1
cloth	1
and	1
exhausted	1
but	1
happy	1
went	1
home	1
vronsky	1
anna	1
and	1
golenishtchev	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
home	1
were	1
particularly	1
lively	1
and	1
cheerful	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
mihailov	1
and	1
his	1
pictures	1
the	1
word	1
talent	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
meant	1
an	1
inborn	1
almost	1
physical	1
aptitude	1
apart	1
from	1
brain	1
and	1
heart	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
expression	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
artist	1
had	1
gained	1
from	1
life	1
recurred	1
particularly	1
often	1
in	1
their	1
talk	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
necessary	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
sum	1
up	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
though	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
said	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
denying	1
his	1
talent	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
talent	1
could	1
not	1
develop	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
education	1
the	1
common	1
defect	1
of	1
our	1
russian	1
artists	1
but	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
had	1
imprinted	1
itself	1
on	1
their	1
memories	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
continually	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
it	1
what	1
an	1
exquisite	1
thing	1
how	1
he	1
has	1
succeeded	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
how	1
simply	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
even	1
comprehend	1
how	1
good	1
it	1
is	1
yes	1
i	1
mustn	1
t	1
let	1
it	1
slip	1
i	1
must	1
buy	1
it	1
said	1
vronsky	1
chapter	1
13	1
mihailov	1
sold	1
vronsky	1
his	1
picture	1
and	1
agreed	1
to	1
paint	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
anna	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
began	1
the	1
work	1
from	1
the	1
fifth	1
sitting	1
the	1
portrait	1
impressed	1
everyone	1
especially	1
vronsky	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
its	1
resemblance	1
but	1
by	1
its	1
characteristic	1
beauty	1
it	1
was	1
strange	1
how	1
mihailov	1
could	1
have	1
discovered	1
just	1
her	1
characteristic	1
beauty	1
one	1
needs	1
to	1
know	1
and	1
love	1
her	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
loved	1
her	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
very	1
sweetest	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
vronsky	1
thought	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
from	1
this	1
portrait	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
learned	1
this	1
sweetest	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
was	1
so	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
others	1
too	1
fancied	1
they	1
had	1
long	1
known	1
it	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
struggling	1
on	1
for	1
ever	1
so	1
long	1
without	1
doing	1
anything	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
portrait	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
just	1
looked	1
and	1
painted	1
it	1
that	1
s	1
where	1
technique	1
comes	1
in	1
that	1
will	1
come	1
was	1
the	1
consoling	1
reassurance	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
golenishtchev	1
in	1
whose	1
view	1
vronsky	1
had	1
both	1
talent	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
most	1
important	1
culture	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
wider	1
outlook	1
on	1
art	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
faith	1
in	1
vronsky	1
s	1
talent	1
was	1
propped	1
up	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
need	1
of	1
vronsky	1
s	1
sympathy	1
and	1
approval	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
articles	1
and	1
ideas	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
praise	1
and	1
support	1
must	1
be	1
mutual	1
in	1
another	1
man	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
vronsky	1
s	1
palazzo	1
mihailov	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
man	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
studio	1
he	1
behaved	1
with	1
hostile	1
courtesy	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
coming	1
closer	1
to	1
people	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
respect	1
he	1
called	1
vronsky	1
your	1
excellency	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
anna	1
s	1
and	1
vronsky	1
s	1
invitations	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
stay	1
to	1
dinner	1
nor	1
come	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
sittings	1
anna	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
friendly	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
to	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
grateful	1
for	1
her	1
portrait	1
vronsky	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
cordial	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
obviously	1
interested	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
artist	1
s	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
picture	1
golenishtchev	1
never	1
let	1
slip	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
instilling	1
sound	1
ideas	1
about	1
art	1
into	1
mihailov	1
but	1
mihailov	1
remained	1
equally	1
chilly	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
anna	1
was	1
aware	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
liked	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
avoided	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
vronsky	1
s	1
talk	1
about	1
his	1
painting	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
stubborn	1
silence	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
stubbornly	1
silent	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
shown	1
vronsky	1
s	1
picture	1
he	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
bored	1
by	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
conversation	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
oppose	1
him	1
altogether	1
mihailov	1
with	1
his	1
reserved	1
and	1
disagreeable	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
hostile	1
attitude	1
was	1
quite	1
disliked	1
by	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
know	1
him	1
better	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
glad	1
when	1
the	1
sittings	1
were	1
over	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
with	1
a	1
magnificent	1
portrait	1
in	1
their	1
possession	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
coming	1
golenishtchev	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
give	1
expression	1
to	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
mihailov	1
was	1
simply	1
jealous	1
of	1
vronsky	1
not	1
envious	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
since	1
he	1
has	1
talent	1
but	1
it	1
annoys	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
wealthy	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
and	1
a	1
count	1
too	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
all	1
detest	1
a	1
title	1
can	1
without	1
any	1
particular	1
trouble	1
do	1
as	1
well	1
if	1
not	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
devoted	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
culture	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
without	1
vronsky	1
defended	1
mihailov	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
believed	1
it	1
because	1
in	1
his	1
view	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
lower	1
world	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
envious	1
anna	1
s	1
portrait	1
the	1
same	1
subject	1
painted	1
from	1
nature	1
both	1
by	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
mihailov	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
shown	1
vronsky	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
mihailov	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it	1
only	1
after	1
mihailov	1
s	1
portrait	1
was	1
painted	1
he	1
left	1
off	1
painting	1
his	1
portrait	1
of	1
anna	1
deciding	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
needed	1
his	1
picture	1
of	1
mediæval	1
life	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
and	1
golenishtchev	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
anna	1
thought	1
it	1
very	1
good	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
celebrated	1
pictures	1
they	1
knew	1
than	1
mihailov	1
s	1
picture	1
mihailov	1
meanwhile	1
although	1
anna	1
s	1
portrait	1
greatly	1
fascinated	1
him	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
glad	1
than	1
they	1
were	1
when	1
the	1
sittings	1
were	1
over	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
golenishtchev	1
s	1
disquisitions	1
upon	1
art	1
and	1
could	1
forget	1
about	1
vronsky	1
s	1
painting	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
prevented	1
from	1
amusing	1
himself	1
with	1
painting	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
dilettanti	1
had	1
a	1
perfect	1
right	1
to	1
paint	1
what	1
they	1
liked	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
distasteful	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
prevented	1
from	1
making	1
himself	1
a	1
big	1
wax	1
doll	1
and	1
kissing	1
it	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
doll	1
and	1
sit	1
before	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
begin	1
caressing	1
his	1
doll	1
as	1
the	1
lover	1
caressed	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
distasteful	1
to	1
the	1
lover	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
distasteful	1
sensation	1
was	1
what	1
mihailov	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
vronsky	1
s	1
painting	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
both	1
ludicrous	1
and	1
irritating	1
both	1
pitiable	1
and	1
offensive	1
vronsky	1
s	1
interest	1
in	1
painting	1
and	1
the	1
middle	1
ages	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long	1
he	1
had	1
enough	1
taste	1
for	1
painting	1
to	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
finish	1
his	1
picture	1
the	1
picture	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
he	1
was	1
vaguely	1
aware	1
that	1
its	1
defects	1
inconspicuous	1
at	1
first	1
would	1
be	1
glaring	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1

him	1
as	1
golenishtchev	1
who	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
continually	1
deceived	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
theory	1
that	1
his	1
idea	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
mature	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
working	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
collecting	1
materials	1
this	1
exasperated	1
and	1
tortured	1
golenishtchev	1
but	1
vronsky	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
deceiving	1
and	1
torturing	1
himself	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
incapable	1
of	1
exasperation	1
with	1
his	1
characteristic	1
decision	1
without	1
explanation	1
or	1
apology	1
he	1
simply	1
ceased	1
working	1
at	1
painting	1
but	1
without	1
this	1
occupation	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
vronsky	1
and	1
of	1
anna	1

wondered	1
at	1
his	1
loss	1
of	1

struck	1
them	1
as	1
intolerably	1
tedious	1
in	1
an	1
italian	1
town	1
the	1

suddenly	1
seemed	1
so	1
obtrusively	1
old	1
and	1
dirty	1

curtains	1
the	1
cracks	1
in	1
the	1

the	1
broken	1

on	1

became	1
so	1
disagreeably	1
obvious	1
and	1
the	1
everlasting	1
sameness	1
of	1
golenishtchev	1
and	1
the	1
italian	1
professor	1
and	1
the	1
german	1

became	1
so	1
wearisome	1
that	1
they	1

levin	1
had	1
been	1
married	1
three	1
months	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
but	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
former	1
dreams	1
disappointed	1
and	1
new	1
unexpected	1
surprises	1
of	1
happiness	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
but	1
on	1
entering	1
upon	1
family	1
life	1
he	1
saw	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
imagined	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
he	1
experienced	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
would	1
experience	1
who	1
after	1
admiring	1
the	1
smooth	1
happy	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
boat	1
on	1
a	1
lake	1
should	1
get	1
himself	1
into	1
that	1
little	1
boat	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
sitting	1
still	1
floating	1
smoothly	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
think	1
too	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
forget	1
where	1
one	1
was	1
floating	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
water	1
under	1
one	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
row	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
unaccustomed	1
hands	1
would	1
be	1
sore	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
that	1
was	1
easy	1
but	1
that	1
doing	1
it	1
though	1
very	1
delightful	1
was	1
very	1
difficult	1
as	1
a	1
bachelor	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
watched	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
married	1
life	1
seen	1
the	1
petty	1
cares	1
the	1
squabbles	1
the	1
jealousy	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
in	1
his	1
future	1
married	1
life	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
nothing	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
even	1
the	1
external	1
forms	1
indeed	1
he	1
fancied	1
must	1
be	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
others	1
in	1
everything	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
being	1
made	1
on	1
an	1
individual	1
pattern	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
entirely	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
pettiest	1
details	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
despised	1
before	1
but	1
which	1
now	1
by	1
no	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
had	1
gained	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
importance	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
contend	1
against	1
and	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
details	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
easy	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
fancied	1
before	1
although	1
levin	1
believed	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
most	1
exact	1
conceptions	1
of	1
domestic	1
life	1
unconsciously	1
like	1
all	1
men	1
he	1
pictured	1
domestic	1
life	1
as	1
the	1
happiest	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
love	1
with	1
nothing	1
to	1
hinder	1
and	1
no	1
petty	1
cares	1
to	1
distract	1
he	1
ought	1
as	1
he	1
conceived	1
the	1
position	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
repose	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
love	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
beloved	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
but	1
like	1
all	1
men	1
he	1
forgot	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
would	1
want	1
work	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
she	1
his	1
poetic	1
exquisite	1
kitty	1
could	1
not	1
merely	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
weeks	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
married	1
life	1
think	1
remember	1
and	1
busy	1
herself	1
about	1
tablecloths	1
and	1
furniture	1
about	1
mattresses	1
for	1
visitors	1
about	1
a	1
tray	1
about	1
the	1
cook	1
and	1
the	1
dinner	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
engaged	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
definiteness	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
declined	1
the	1
tour	1
abroad	1
and	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
something	1
she	1
wanted	1
and	1
could	1
still	1
think	1
of	1
something	1
outside	1
her	1
love	1
this	1
had	1
jarred	1
upon	1
him	1
then	1
and	1
now	1
her	1
trivial	1
cares	1
and	1
anxieties	1
jarred	1
upon	1
him	1
several	1
times	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
essential	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
loving	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
jeered	1
at	1
these	1
domestic	1
pursuits	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
admiring	1
them	1
he	1
jeered	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
arranged	1
the	1
furniture	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
moscow	1
rearranged	1
their	1
room	1
hung	1
up	1
curtains	1
prepared	1
rooms	1
for	1
visitors	1
a	1
room	1
for	1
dolly	1
saw	1
after	1
an	1
abode	1
for	1
her	1
new	1
maid	1
ordered	1
dinner	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
cook	1
came	1
into	1
collision	1
with	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
taking	1
from	1
her	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
stores	1
he	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
old	1
cook	1
smiled	1
admiring	1
her	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
inexperienced	1
impossible	1
orders	1
how	1
mournfully	1
and	1
tenderly	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
over	1
the	1
young	1
mistress	1
s	1
new	1
arrangements	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
kitty	1
was	1
extraordinarily	1
sweet	1
when	1
laughing	1
and	1
crying	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
her	1
maid	1
masha	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
looking	1
upon	1
her	1
as	1
her	1
young	1
lady	1
and	1
so	1
no	1
one	1
obeyed	1
her	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
sweet	1
but	1
strange	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
without	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
great	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
change	1
she	1
was	1
experiencing	1
she	1
who	1
at	1
home	1
had	1
sometimes	1
wanted	1
some	1
favorite	1
dish	1
or	1
sweets	1
without	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
getting	1
either	1
now	1
could	1
order	1
what	1
she	1
liked	1
buy	1
pounds	1
of	1
sweets	1
spend	1
as	1
much	1
money	1
as	1
she	1
liked	1
and	1
order	1
any	1
puddings	1
she	1
pleased	1
she	1
was	1
dreaming	1
with	1
delight	1
now	1
of	1
dolly	1
s	1
coming	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
especially	1
because	1
she	1
would	1
order	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
their	1
favorite	1
puddings	1
and	1
dolly	1
would	1
appreciate	1
all	1
her	1
new	1
housekeeping	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
herself	1
why	1
and	1
wherefore	1
but	1
the	1
arranging	1
of	1
her	1
house	1
had	1
an	1
irresistible	1
attraction	1
for	1
her	1
instinctively	1
feeling	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
spring	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
days	1
of	1
rough	1
weather	1
too	1
she	1
built	1
her	1
nest	1
as	1
best	1
she	1
could	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
haste	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
build	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
this	1
care	1
for	1
domestic	1
details	1
in	1
kitty	1
so	1
opposed	1
to	1
levin	1
s	1
ideal	1
of	1
exalted	1
happiness	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
disappointments	1
and	1
this	1
sweet	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
household	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
loving	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
happy	1
surprises	1
another	1
disappointment	1
and	1
happy	1
surprise	1
came	1
in	1
their	1
quarrels	1
levin	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
conceived	1
that	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
any	1
relations	1
could	1
arise	1
other	1
than	1
tender	1
respectful	1
and	1
loving	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
early	1
days	1
they	1
quarreled	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
himself	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
and	1
wrung	1
her	1
arms	1
this	1
first	1
quarrel	1
arose	1
from	1
levin	1
s	1
having	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
farmhouse	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
away	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
too	1
long	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
by	1
a	1
short	1
cut	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
way	1
he	1
drove	1
home	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
happiness	1
and	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
drew	1
to	1
home	1
the	1
warmer	1
was	1
his	1
tenderness	1
for	1
her	1
he	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
with	1
an	1
even	1
stronger	1
feeling	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
offer	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
lowering	1
expression	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
kissed	1
her	1
she	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
enjoying	1
yourself	1
she	1
began	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
spiteful	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
reproach	1
of	1
senseless	1
jealousy	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
torturing	1
her	1
during	1
that	1
half	1
hour	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
sitting	1
motionless	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
burst	1
from	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
clearly	1
understood	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
when	1
he	1
led	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
after	1
the	1
wedding	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
simply	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
ended	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
from	1
the	1
agonizing	1
sensation	1
of	1
division	1
that	1
he	1
experienced	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
he	1
was	1
offended	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
second	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
offended	1
by	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
himself	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
feels	1
when	1
having	1
suddenly	1
received	1
a	1
violent	1
blow	1
from	1
behind	1
he	1
turns	1
round	1
angry	1
and	1
eager	1
to	1
avenge	1
himself	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
his	1
antagonist	1
and	1
finds	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
himself	1
who	1
has	1
accidentally	1
struck	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
soothe	1
the	1
pain	1
never	1
afterwards	1
did	1
he	1
feel	1
it	1
with	1
such	1
intensity	1
but	1
this	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
get	1
over	1
it	1
his	1
natural	1
feeling	1
urged	1
him	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
wrong	1
but	1
to	1
prove	1
her	1
wrong	1
would	1
mean	1
irritating	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
making	1
the	1
rupture	1
greater	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
suffering	1
one	1
habitual	1
feeling	1
impelled	1
him	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
blame	1
and	1
to	1
pass	1
it	1
on	1
to	1
her	1
another	1
feeling	1
even	1
stronger	1
impelled	1
him	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
the	1
rupture	1
without	1
letting	1
it	1
grow	1
greater	1
to	1
remain	1
under	1
such	1
undeserved	1
reproach	1
was	1
wretched	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
suffer	1
by	1
justifying	1
himself	1
was	1
worse	1
still	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
half	1
awake	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
pain	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
tear	1
out	1
to	1
fling	1
away	1
the	1
aching	1
place	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1

himself	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
try	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
aching	1
place	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
they	1
made	1
peace	1
she	1
recognizing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
wrong	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
so	1
became	1
tenderer	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
experienced	1
new	1
redoubled	1
happiness	1
in	1
their	1
love	1
but	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
such	1
quarrels	1
from	1
happening	1
again	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
often	1
too	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
unexpected	1
and	1
trivial	1
grounds	1
these	1
quarrels	1
frequently	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
early	1
period	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
often	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
when	1
one	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
the	1
peace	1
was	1
not	1
broken	1
but	1
when	1
both	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
an	1
ill	1
humor	1
quarrels	1
sprang	1
up	1
from	1
such	1
incomprehensibly	1
trifling	1
causes	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
never	1
remember	1
afterwards	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
quarreled	1
about	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper	1
their	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
redoubled	1
but	1
still	1
this	1
first	1
period	1
of	1
their	1
married	1
life	1
was	1
a	1
difficult	1
time	1
for	1
them	1
during	1
all	1
this	1
early	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
vivid	1
sense	1
of	1
tension	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
tugging	1
in	1
opposite	1
directions	1
of	1
the	1
chain	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
bound	1
altogether	1
their	1
honeymoon	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
month	1
after	1
their	1
wedding	1
from	1
which	1
from	1
tradition	1
levin	1
expected	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
not	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
sweetness	1
but	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
both	1
as	1
the	1
bitterest	1
and	1
most	1
humiliating	1
period	1
in	1
their	1
lives	1
they	1
both	1
alike	1
tried	1
in	1
later	1
life	1
to	1
blot	1
out	1
from	1
their	1
memories	1
all	1
the	1
monstrous	1
shameful	1
incidents	1
of	1
that	1
morbid	1
period	1
when	1
both	1
were	1
rarely	1
in	1
a	1
normal	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
both	1
were	1
rarely	1
quite	1
themselves	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
month	1
of	1
their	1
married	1
life	1
after	1
their	1
return	1
from	1
moscow	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
for	1
a	1

and	1
wrote	1
never	1
losing	1
the	1
happy	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
presence	1
his	1
work	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
land	1
system	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
down	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
abandoned	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
formerly	1
these	1
pursuits	1
and	1
ideas	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
petty	1
and	1
trivial	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
darkness	1
that	1
overspread	1
all	1
life	1
now	1
they	1
seemed	1
as	1
unimportant	1
and	1
petty	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
suffused	1
with	1
the	1
brilliant	1
light	1
of	1
happiness	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
work	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
gravity	1
of	1
his	1
attention	1
had	1
passed	1
to	1
something	1
else	1
and	1
that	1
consequently	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
work	1
quite	1
differently	1
and	1
more	1
clearly	1
formerly	1
this	1
work	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
him	1
an	1
escape	1
from	1
life	1
formerly	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
that	1
without	1
this	1
work	1
his	1
life	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
gloomy	1
now	1
these	1
pursuits	1
were	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
life	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
uniformly	1
bright	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
manuscript	1
reading	1
through	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
he	1
found	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
worth	1
his	1
working	1
at	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
ideas	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
superfluous	1
and	1
extreme	1
but	1
many	1
blanks	1
became	1
distinct	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
reviewed	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
he	1
was	1
writing	1
now	1
a	1
new	1
chapter	1
on	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
disastrous	1
condition	1
of	1
agriculture	1
in	1
russia	1
he	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
poverty	1
of	1
russia	1
arises	1
not	1
merely	1
from	1
the	1
anomalous	1
distribution	1
of	1
landed	1
property	1
and	1
misdirected	1
reforms	1
but	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
contributed	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
to	1
this	1
result	1
was	1
the	1
civilization	1
from	1
without	1
abnormally	1
grafted	1
upon	1
russia	1
especially	1
facilities	1
of	1
communication	1
as	1
railways	1
leading	1
to	1
centralization	1
in	1
towns	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
luxury	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
development	1
of	1
manufactures	1
credit	1
and	1
its	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
speculation	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
detriment	1
of	1
agriculture	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
normal	1
development	1
of	1
wealth	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
all	1
these	1
phenomena	1
would	1
arise	1
only	1
when	1
a	1
considerable	1
amount	1
of	1
labor	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
into	1
agriculture	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
under	1
regular	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
definite	1
conditions	1
that	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
ought	1
to	1
increase	1
proportionally	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
other	1
sources	1
of	1
wealth	1
should	1
not	1
outstrip	1
agriculture	1
that	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
stage	1
of	1
agriculture	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
means	1
of	1
communication	1
corresponding	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
our	1
unsettled	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
railways	1
called	1
into	1
being	1
by	1
political	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
economic	1
needs	1
were	1
premature	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
promoting	1
agriculture	1
as	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
competing	1
with	1
agriculture	1
and	1
promoting	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
manufactures	1
and	1
credit	1
and	1
so	1
arresting	1
its	1
progress	1
and	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
sided	1
and	1
premature	1
development	1
of	1
one	1
organ	1
in	1
an	1
animal	1
would	1
hinder	1
its	1
general	1
development	1
so	1
in	1
the	1

of	1

indubitably	1
necessary	1

they	1

arisen	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
time	1

with	1
us	1
only	1
done	1
harm	1

throwing	1
into	1

her	1

young	1
prince	1
tcharsky	1
who	1

with	1
great	1

with	1

the	1
day	1
before	1
they	1
left	1
moscow	1

how	1

silly	1
he	1
is	1

of	1
me	1
if	1

that	1
i	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
them	1
than	1
of	1
piotr	1
the	1
cook	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
red	1
neck	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
possession	1
strange	1
to	1
herself	1
though	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
pity	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
work	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
plenty	1
of	1
time	1
i	1
must	1

and	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
wide	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
intensify	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
her	1
gaze	1
yes	1
they	1
draw	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
sap	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
false	1
appearance	1
of	1
prosperity	1
he	1
muttered	1
stopping	1
to	1
write	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
smiling	1

well	1
he	1

and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1

she	1

it	1
s	1
nothing	1
i	1
wanted	1
you	1
to	1

round	1
she	1
said	1
watching	1
him	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
vexed	1
at	1
being	1
interrupted	1
or	1
not	1
how	1
happy	1
we	1
are	1
alone	1
together	1
i	1

he	1
said	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
radiant	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
i	1
m	1
just	1
as	1
happy	1
i	1

never	1

anywhere	1

pursing	1
up	1
her	1

i	1
must	1
cut	1
out	1
these	1
little	1
holes	1
now	1
do	1
you	1

she	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
scissors	1
and	1
began	1
cutting	1
them	1
out	1
no	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1

it	1
he	1

sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
watching	1
the	1
tiny	1
scissors	1
moving	1
round	1
oh	1
what	1

i	1
thinking	1
about	1
i	1
was	1
thinking	1
about	1
moscow	1
about	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
your	1

why	1
should	1
i	1
of	1
all	1

such	1
happiness	1
it	1
s	1
unnatural	1
too	1
good	1
he	1
said	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
i	1

quite	1
the	1
opposite	1
the	1
better	1
things	1

the	1

to	1
me	1

you	1

a	1
little	1
curl	1
loose	1
he	1

carefully	1
turning	1
her	1
head	1
round	1
a	1
little	1
curl	1
oh	1
yes	1
no	1
no	1
we	1
are	1
busy	1
at	1
our	1
work	1
work	1
did	1
not	1
progress	1
further	1
and	1
they	1
darted	1
apart	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
like	1
culprits	1
when	1
kouzma	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
tea	1
was	1
ready	1

just	1

quickly	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
or	1
else	1
i	1
shall	1
read	1
your	1
letters	1
without	1
you	1
left	1
alone	1
after	1
putting	1
his	1
manuscripts	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
portfolio	1
bought	1
by	1
her	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
hands	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
washstand	1
with	1
the	1
elegant	1
fittings	1
that	1
had	1
all	1
made	1
their	1
appearance	1
with	1
her	1
levin	1
smiled	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disapprovingly	1
at	1
those	1
thoughts	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
remorse	1
fretted	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
shameful	1
effeminate	1
capuan	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
present	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
right	1
to	1
go	1
on	1

for	1
the	1

seriously	1

what	1

begin	1
and	1
throw	1
it	1
aside	1
even	1
my	1

almost	1

up	1
on	1

her	1

i	1

she	1

dull	1
alone	1
and	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
before	1
marriage	1
life	1
was	1
nothing	1
much	1
somehow	1
didn	1

that	1

began	1
in	1

and	1
here	1
almost	1
three	1
months	1
have	1
passed	1
and	1

have	1
spent	1
my	1

so	1
idly	1

unprofitably	1
no	1

what	1

at	1
the	1

a	1

in	1

after	1
their	1
fresh	1

life	1
especially	1
because	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
falsity	1
made	1
by	1
the	1

was	1
so	1
out	1
of	1

with	1

awaited	1

by	1

looking	1
at	1

with	1

guilty	1
eyes	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

without	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
stumbled	1
over	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
dared	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1

him	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
the	1

as	1
when	1

her	1
in	1

about	1

remembers	1
her	1
abroad	1

that	1

but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
opened	1
and	1
kitty	1
peeped	1
out	1
levin	1
crimsoned	1
both	1
from	1
shame	1
and	1
anger	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
had	1
put	1
herself	1
and	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
difficult	1
position	1
but	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
crimsoned	1
still	1
more	1
she	1
positively	1
shrank	1
together	1
and	1
flushed	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
clutching	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
her	1
apron	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
twisted	1
them	1
in	1
her	1
red	1
fingers	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
levin	1
saw	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
eager	1
curiosity	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
kitty	1
looked	1
at	1
this	1
awful	1
woman	1
so	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
it	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
well	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
like	1
this	1
levin	1
said	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
walked	1
jauntily	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
across	1
the	1
corridor	1
as	1
though	1
about	1
his	1
affairs	1
well	1
then	1
come	1
in	1
said	1
kitty	1
turning	1
to	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
who	1
had	1
recovered	1
herself	1
but	1
noticing	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
face	1
of	1
dismay	1
or	1
go	1
on	1
go	1
and	1
then	1
come	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
levin	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
room	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
expected	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
room	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
self	1
deception	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
was	1
so	1
frequent	1
with	1
the	1
consumptive	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
struck	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
during	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
physical	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
death	1
more	1
marked	1
greater	1
weakness	1
greater	1
emaciation	1
but	1
still	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
condition	1
of	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
himself	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
same	1
distress	1
at	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
horror	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
death	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
then	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
himself	1
for	1
this	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
something	1
utterly	1
different	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
dirty	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
painted	1
panels	1
of	1
its	1
walls	1
filthy	1
with	1
spittle	1
and	1
conversation	1
audible	1
through	1
the	1
thin	1
partition	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
in	1
a	1
stifling	1
atmosphere	1
saturated	1
with	1
impurities	1
on	1
a	1
bedstead	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
there	1
lay	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
quilt	1
a	1
body	1
one	1
arm	1
of	1
this	1
body	1
was	1
above	1
the	1
quilt	1
and	1
the	1
wrist	1
huge	1
as	1
a	1
rake	1
handle	1
was	1
attached	1
inconceivably	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
thin	1
long	1
bone	1
of	1
the	1
arm	1
smooth	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
the	1
head	1
lay	1
sideways	1
on	1
the	1
pillow	1
levin	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
scanty	1
locks	1
wet	1
with	1
sweat	1
on	1
the	1
temples	1
and	1
tense	1
transparent	1
looking	1
forehead	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
that	1
that	1
fearful	1
body	1
was	1
my	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
thought	1
levin	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
closer	1
saw	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
doubt	1
became	1
impossible	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
levin	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
those	1
eager	1
eyes	1
raised	1
at	1
his	1
approach	1
only	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
faint	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
under	1
the	1
sticky	1
mustache	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
terrible	1
truth	1
that	1
this	1
death	1
like	1
body	1
was	1
his	1
living	1
brother	1
the	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
reproachfully	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
and	1
immediately	1
this	1
glance	1
established	1
a	1
living	1
relationship	1
between	1
living	1
men	1
levin	1
immediately	1
felt	1
the	1
reproach	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
felt	1
remorse	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
happiness	1
when	1
konstantin	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
nikolay	1
smiled	1
the	1
smile	1
was	1
faint	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
smile	1
the	1
stern	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
was	1
unchanged	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
me	1
like	1
this	1
he	1
articulated	1
with	1
effort	1
yes	1
no	1
said	1
levin	1
hesitating	1
over	1
his	1
words	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
before	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
wedding	1
i	1
made	1
inquiries	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
talk	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
especially	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
simply	1
stared	1
without	1
dropping	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
evidently	1
penetrated	1
to	1
the	1
inner	1
meaning	1
of	1
each	1
word	1
levin	1
told	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
him	1
nikolay	1
expressed	1
pleasure	1
but	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
frightening	1
her	1
by	1
his	1
condition	1
a	1
silence	1
followed	1
suddenly	1
nikolay	1
stirred	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
levin	1
expected	1
something	1
of	1
peculiar	1
gravity	1
and	1
importance	1
from	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
but	1
nikolay	1
began	1
speaking	1
of	1
his	1
health	1
he	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
regretting	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
celebrated	1
moscow	1
doctor	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
still	1
hoped	1
seizing	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
silence	1
levin	1
got	1
up	1
anxious	1
to	1
escape	1
if	1
only	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
from	1
his	1
agonizing	1
emotion	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
fetch	1
his	1
wife	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
her	1
to	1
tidy	1
up	1
here	1
it	1
s	1
dirty	1
and	1
stinking	1
here	1
i	1
expect	1
marya	1
clear	1
up	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
said	1
with	1
effort	1
oh	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
ve	1
cleared	1
up	1
go	1
away	1
yourself	1
he	1
added	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
levin	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
going	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
fetch	1
his	1
wife	1
but	1
now	1
taking	1
stock	1
of	1
the	1
emotion	1
he	1
was	1
feeling	1
he	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
try	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
why	1
should	1
she	1
suffer	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
suffering	1
he	1
thought	1
well	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
kitty	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
face	1
oh	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
for	1
said	1
levin	1
kitty	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
looking	1
timidly	1
and	1
ruefully	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
then	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
elbow	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
kostya	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
easier	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
together	1
you	1
only	1
take	1
me	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
him	1
please	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
she	1
said	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
painful	1
there	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
help	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
please	1
let	1
me	1
she	1
besought	1
her	1
husband	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
depended	1
on	1
it	1
levin	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
agree	1
and	1
regaining	1
his	1
composure	1
and	1
completely	1
forgetting	1
about	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
by	1
now	1
he	1
went	1
again	1
in	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
kitty	1
stepping	1
lightly	1
and	1
continually	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
showing	1
him	1
a	1
valorous	1
and	1
sympathetic	1
face	1
kitty	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sick	1
room	1
and	1
turning	1
without	1
haste	1
noiselessly	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
inaudible	1
steps	1
she	1
went	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
s	1
bedside	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
turn	1
his	1
head	1
she	1
immediately	1
clasped	1
in	1
her	1
fresh	1
young	1
hand	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
his	1
huge	1
hand	1
pressed	1
it	1
and	1
began	1
speaking	1
with	1
that	1
soft	1
eagerness	1
sympathetic	1
and	1
not	1
jarring	1
which	1
is	1
peculiar	1
to	1
women	1
we	1
have	1
met	1
though	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
acquainted	1
at	1
soden	1
she	1
said	1
you	1
never	1
thought	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
sister	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
recognized	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
radiant	1
smile	1
at	1
her	1
entrance	1
yes	1
i	1
should	1
what	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
you	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
not	1
a	1
day	1
has	1
passed	1
that	1
kostya	1
has	1
not	1

you	1
and	1
been	1
anxious	1
but	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1

interest	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
there	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
the	1
stern	1
reproachful	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1

of	1
the	1

you	1

she	1
said	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
fixed	1
stare	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
we	1
must	1
ask	1
about	1
another	1

could	1
not	1
look	1
calmly	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
himself	1
be	1
natural	1
and	1
calm	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
attention	1
were	1
unconsciously	1
dimmed	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
distinguish	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
position	1
he	1
smelt	1
the	1
awful	1
odor	1
saw	1
the	1
dirt	1
disorder	1
and	1
miserable	1
condition	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
groans	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
help	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
analyze	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
s	1
situation	1
to	1
consider	1
how	1
that	1
body	1
was	1
lying	1
under	1
the	1
quilt	1
how	1
those	1
emaciated	1
legs	1
and	1
thighs	1
and	1
spine	1
were	1
lying	1
huddled	1
up	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
more	1
comfortable	1
whether	1
anything	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
make	1
things	1
if	1
not	1
better	1
at	1
least	1
less	1
bad	1
it	1
made	1
his	1
blood	1
run	1
cold	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
details	1
he	1
was	1
absolutely	1
convinced	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
prolong	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
life	1
or	1
to	1
relieve	1
his	1
suffering	1
but	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
regarding	1
all	1
aid	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
and	1
exasperated	1
him	1
and	1
this	1
made	1
it	1
still	1
more	1
painful	1
for	1
levin	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
sick	1
room	1
was	1
agony	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
still	1
worse	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
on	1
various	1
pretexts	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
coming	1
in	1
again	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
remain	1
alone	1
but	1
kitty	1
thought	1
and	1
felt	1
and	1
acted	1
quite	1
differently	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
she	1
pitied	1
him	1
and	1
pity	1
in	1
her	1
womanly	1
heart	1
did	1
not	1
arouse	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
loathing	1
that	1
it	1
aroused	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
but	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
act	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
state	1
and	1
to	1
remedy	1
them	1
and	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
either	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
and	1
immediately	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
very	1
details	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
which	1
reduced	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
terror	1
immediately	1
engaged	1
her	1

the	1

man	1
settled	1
comfortably	1
and	1
everything	1
about	1
him	1
completely	1
changed	1
the	1
heavy	1
smell	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
aromatic	1
vinegar	1
which	1
kitty	1
with	1
pouting	1
lips	1
and	1
puffed	1
out	1
rosy	1

was	1

in	1
a	1
clean	1
night	1
shirt	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
collar	1
about	1
his	1
astoundingly	1
thin	1
neck	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
expression	1
of	1
hope	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
at	1
kitty	1
the	1
doctor	1
brought	1
by	1
levin	1
and	1
found	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
attending	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
as	1
the	1
patient	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
new	1
doctor	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
stethoscope	1
and	1
sounded	1
the	1
patient	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
prescribed	1
medicine	1
and	1
with	1
extreme	1
minuteness	1
explained	1
first	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
medicine	1
and	1
then	1
what	1
diet	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
to	1
he	1
advised	1
eggs	1
raw	1
or	1
hardly	1
cooked	1
and	1
seltzer	1
water	1
with	1
warm	1
milk	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
temperature	1
when	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
which	1
levin	1
could	1
distinguish	1
only	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
your	1
katya	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
praising	1
her	1
he	1
called	1
indeed	1
to	1
katya	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
her	1
i	1
m	1
much	1
better	1
already	1
he	1
said	1
why	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
got	1
well	1
long	1
ago	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
towards	1
his	1
lips	1
but	1
as	1
though	1
afraid	1
she	1
would	1
dislike	1
it	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
let	1
it	1
go	1
and	1
only	1
stroked	1
it	1
kitty	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
both	1
hers	1
and	1
pressed	1
it	1
now	1
turn	1
me	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
he	1
said	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
kitty	1
she	1
alone	1
understood	1
she	1
understood	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
mentally	1
keeping	1
watch	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
needed	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
he	1
always	1
sleeps	1
on	1
that	1
side	1

him	1
over	1

enough	1
can	1
you	1

said	1
to	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
not	1
answered	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
terrible	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
levin	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
that	1
terrible	1
body	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
quilt	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
preferred	1
to	1
know	1
nothing	1
under	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
influence	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
resolute	1
face	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
arms	1
into	1
the	1
bed	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
strength	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
heaviness	1
of	1
those	1
powerless	1
limbs	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
turning	1
him	1
over	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
huge	1
emaciated	1
arm	1
about	1
his	1
neck	1
kitty	1
swiftly	1
and	1
noiselessly	1
turned	1
the	1
pillow	1
beat	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
settled	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
s	1
head	1
smoothing	1
back	1
his	1
hair	1
which	1
was	1
sticking	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
moist	1
brow	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
kept	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
was	1
pulling	1
it	1
somewhere	1
levin	1
yielded	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart	1
yes	1
he	1
drew	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
levin	1
shaking	1
with	1
sobs	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
articulate	1
a	1
word	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

chapter	1

thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent	1
and	1
hast	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
babes	1
so	1
levin	1
thought	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
evening	1
levin	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
text	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
so	1
consider	1
himself	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
intellect	1
than	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
knowing	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
death	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
his	1
intellect	1
he	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
the	1
brains	1
of	1
many	1
great	1
men	1
whose	1
thoughts	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
had	1
brooded	1
over	1
death	1
and	1
yet	1
knew	1
not	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
knew	1
about	1
it	1
different	1
as	1
those	1
two	1
women	1
were	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
and	1
katya	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
had	1
called	1
her	1
and	1
as	1
levin	1
particularly	1
liked	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
quite	1
alike	1
in	1
this	1
both	1
knew	1
without	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
doubt	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
life	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
death	1
and	1
though	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
have	1
answered	1
and	1
would	1
even	1
not	1
have	1
understood	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
presented	1
themselves	1
to	1
levin	1
both	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
event	1
and	1
were	1
precisely	1
alike	1
in	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
which	1
they	1
shared	1
with	1
millions	1
of	1
people	1
the	1
proof	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
for	1
a	1
certainty	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
death	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
without	1
a	1
second	1
of	1
hesitation	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
the	1
dying	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
frightened	1
of	1
them	1
levin	1
and	1
other	1
men	1
like	1
him	1
though	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
death	1
obviously	1
did	1

they	1
were	1

of	1

were	1
absolutely	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
people	1
were	1
dying	1
if	1
levin	1
had	1
been	1
alone	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1

he	1
would	1
have	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
terror	1

with	1
still	1
greater	1
terror	1
waited	1

would	1
not	1
have	1
known	1

else	1
to	1

how	1
to	1
look	1
how	1
to	1
move	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
outside	1
things	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
shocking	1
impossible	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
depressing	1
subjects	1
also	1
impossible	1
to	1
be	1

also	1
impossible	1
if	1

i	1

kitty	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
herself	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
herself	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
about	1
him	1
because	1
she	1
knew	1
something	1
and	1
all	1
went	1
well	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
herself	1
even	1
and	1
about	1
her	1
wedding	1
and	1
smiled	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
petted	1
him	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
cases	1
of	1
recovery	1
and	1
all	1
went	1
well	1
so	1
then	1
she	1
must	1
know	1
the	1
proof	1
that	1
her	1
behavior	1
and	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
s	1
was	1
not	1
instinctive	1

the	1
relief	1
of	1

both	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1

required	1
for	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
something	1
else	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

of	1
taking	1

their	1

did	1
not	1
even	1
forget	1
to	1
sprinkle	1
them	1
with	1
persian	1
powder	1
she	1
showed	1
that	1
alertness	1
that	1
swiftness	1
of	1
reflection	1
which	1
comes	1
out	1
in	1
men	1
before	1
a	1
battle	1
in	1
conflict	1
in	1
the	1
dangerous	1
and	1
decisive	1
moments	1
of	1
life	1
those	1
moments	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
shows	1
once	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
value	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
past	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
wasted	1
but	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
preparation	1
for	1
these	1
moments	1
everything	1
went	1
rapidly	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
twelve	1
o	1
clock	1
all	1
their	1
things	1
were	1
arranged	1
cleanly	1
and	1
tidily	1
in	1
her	1
rooms	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
the	1

was	1
unpardonable	1
to	1

to	1

to	1

even	1
now	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
every	1
movement	1
he	1
made	1
was	1
unseemly	1
she	1

the	1

she	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1

in	1
it	1
they	1

neither	1

for	1

did	1
not	1
even	1
go	1

i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
i	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1

sitting	1
in	1
her	1
dressing	1

before	1
her	1
folding	1
looking	1
glass	1
combing	1
her	1
soft	1
fragrant	1
hair	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
comb	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
mamma	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
there	1
are	1
prayers	1
said	1
for	1
recovery	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
he	1
can	1
possibly	1
recover	1
said	1
levin	1
watching	1
a	1
slender	1
tress	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
round	1
little	1
head	1
that	1
was	1
continually	1
hidden	1
when	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
comb	1
through	1
the	1
front	1
i	1
asked	1
the	1
doctor	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
couldn	1
t	1
live	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
days	1
but	1
can	1
they	1
be	1
sure	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
anyway	1
that	1
i	1
persuaded	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
askance	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
through	1
her	1
hair	1
anything	1
is	1
possible	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
that	1
peculiar	1
rather	1
sly	1
expression	1
that	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
religion	1
since	1
their	1
conversation	1
about	1
religion	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
engaged	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
ever	1
started	1
a	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
she	1
performed	1
all	1
the	1
ceremonies	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
church	1
saying	1
her	1
prayers	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
always	1
with	1
the	1
unvarying	1
conviction	1
that	1
this	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
assertion	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
was	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
christian	1
as	1
she	1
and	1
indeed	1
a	1
far	1
better	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
about	1
it	1
was	1
simply	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
absurd	1
masculine	1
freaks	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
about	1
her	1
broderie	1
anglaise	1
that	1
good	1
people	1
patch	1
holes	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
cut	1
them	1
on	1
purpose	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
yes	1
you	1
see	1
this	1
woman	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
manage	1
all	1
this	1
said	1
levin	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
own	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
came	1
you	1
are	1
such	1
purity	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
kiss	1
it	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
such	1
closeness	1
to	1
death	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
improper	1
he	1
merely	1
squeezed	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
penitent	1
air	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
brightening	1
eyes	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
miserable	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
lifting	1
her	1
hands	1
which	1
hid	1
her	1
cheeks	1
flushing	1
with	1
pleasure	1
twisted	1
her	1
coil	1
of	1
hair	1
on	1
the	1
nape	1
of	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
pinned	1
it	1
there	1
no	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
luckily	1
i	1
learned	1
a	1
lot	1
at	1
soden	1
surely	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
people	1
there	1
so	1
ill	1
worse	1
what	1
s	1
so	1
awful	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
young	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
believe	1
how	1
charming	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
youth	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
then	1
i	1
can	1
quite	1
quite	1
believe	1
it	1
how	1
i	1
feel	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
friends	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
distressed	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
she	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
yes	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
he	1
said	1
mournfully	1
he	1
s	1
just	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
say	1
they	1
re	1
not	1
for	1
this	1

we	1
have	1
many	1
days	1
before	1

the	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
received	1
the	1
sacrament	1
and	1
extreme	1
unction	1
during	1
the	1
ceremony	1
nikolay	1
levin	1
prayed	1
fervently	1
his	1
great	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
on	1
the	1
holy	1
image	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
card	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
colored	1
napkin	1
expressed	1
such	1
passionate	1
prayer	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
awful	1
to	1
levin	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
levin	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
passionate	1
prayer	1
and	1
hope	1
would	1
only	1
make	1
him	1
feel	1
more	1
bitterly	1
parting	1
from	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
so	1
loved	1
levin	1
knew	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
the	1
workings	1
of	1
his	1
intellect	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
unbelief	1
came	1
not	1
from	1
life	1
being	1
easier	1
for	1
him	1
without	1
faith	1
but	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
because	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
the	1
contemporary	1
scientific	1
interpretation	1
of	1
natural	1
phenomena	1
crushed	1
out	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
present	1
return	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
legitimate	1
one	1
brought	1
about	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
intellect	1
but	1
simply	1
a	1
temporary	1
interested	1
return	1
to	1
faith	1
in	1
a	1
desperate	1
hope	1
of	1
recovery	1
levin	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
kitty	1
had	1
strengthened	1
his	1
hope	1
by	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
marvelous	1
recoveries	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
levin	1
knew	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
agonizingly	1
painful	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
supplicating	1
hopeful	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
emaciated	1
wrist	1
lifted	1
with	1
difficulty	1
making	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
the	1
tense	1
brow	1
and	1
the	1
prominent	1
shoulders	1
and	1
hollow	1
gasping	1
chest	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
consistent	1
with	1
the	1
life	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
praying	1
for	1
during	1
the	1
sacrament	1
levin	1
did	1
what	1
he	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
had	1
done	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
god	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
exist	1
make	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
recover	1
of	1
course	1
this	1
same	1
thing	1
has	1
been	1
repeated	1
many	1
times	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
save	1
him	1
and	1
me	1
after	1
extreme	1
unction	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
became	1
suddenly	1
much	1
better	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
cough	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
smiled	1
kissed	1
kitty	1
s	1
hand	1
thanking	1
her	1
with	1
tears	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
comfortable	1
free	1
from	1
pain	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
strong	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
appetite	1
he	1
even	1
raised	1
himself	1
when	1
his	1
soup	1
was	1
brought	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
cutlet	1
as	1
well	1
hopelessly	1
ill	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
obvious	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
recover	1
levin	1
and	1
kitty	1
were	1
for	1
that	1
hour	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
happy	1
though	1
fearful	1
of	1
being	1
mistaken	1
is	1
he	1
better	1
yes	1
much	1
it	1
s	1
wonderful	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
wonderful	1
in	1
it	1
anyway	1
he	1
s	1
better	1
they	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
smiling	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
this	1
self	1
deception	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
long	1
duration	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
quiet	1
sleep	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
waked	1
up	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
by	1
his	1
cough	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
every	1
hope	1
vanished	1
in	1
those	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
himself	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
his	1
suffering	1
crushed	1
all	1
hopes	1
in	1
levin	1
and	1
kitty	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
himself	1
leaving	1
no	1
doubt	1
no	1
memory	1
even	1
of	1
past	1
hopes	1
without	1
referring	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
believed	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
as	1
though	1
ashamed	1
even	1
to	1
recall	1
it	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
iodine	1
to	1
inhale	1
in	1
a	1
bottle	1
covered	1
with	1
perforated	1
paper	1
levin	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
bottle	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
look	1
of	1
passionate	1
hope	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
sacrament	1
was	1
now	1
fastened	1
on	1
his	1
brother	1
demanding	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
words	1
that	1

he	1
gasped	1
looking	1
round	1
while	1
levin	1
reluctantly	1
assented	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
words	1
no	1
so	1
i	1
can	1
say	1

for	1

went	1
through	1
that	1
farce	1

s	1
so	1
sweet	1
but	1

and	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
deceive	1
ourselves	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
i	1
believe	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
squeezing	1
the	1
bottle	1
in	1
his	1
bony	1
hand	1
he	1
began	1
breathing	1
over	1
it	1
at	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
levin	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
drinking	1
tea	1
in	1
their	1
room	1
when	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
ran	1
in	1
to	1
them	1
breathlessly	1
she	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
quivering	1
he	1
is	1
dying	1
she	1
whispered	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
will	1
die	1
this	1
minute	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
ran	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
raised	1
up	1
with	1
one	1
elbow	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
his	1
long	1
back	1
bent	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
hanging	1
low	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
levin	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
after	1
a	1
silence	1
i	1
feel	1
i	1
m	1
setting	1
off	1
nikolay	1
said	1
with	1
difficulty	1
but	1
with	1
extreme	1
distinctness	1
screwing	1
the	1
words	1
out	1
of	1
himself	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
raise	1
his	1
head	1
but	1
simply	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
upwards	1
without	1
their	1
reaching	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
face	1
katya	1
go	1
away	1
he	1
added	1
levin	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
peremptory	1
whisper	1
made	1
her	1
go	1
out	1
i	1
m	1
setting	1
off	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
said	1
levin	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
because	1
i	1
m	1
setting	1
off	1
he	1
repeated	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
liking	1
for	1
the	1
phrase	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
end	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
lie	1
down	1
you	1
d	1
be	1
easier	1
she	1
said	1
i	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
soon	1
enough	1
he	1
pronounced	1
slowly	1
when	1
i	1
m	1
dead	1
he	1
said	1
sarcastically	1
wrathfully	1
well	1
you	1
can	1
lay	1
me	1
down	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
levin	1
laid	1
his	1
brother	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
holding	1
his	1
breath	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
lay	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
but	1
the	1
muscles	1
twitched	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
as	1
with	1
one	1
thinking	1
deeply	1
and	1
intensely	1
levin	1
involuntarily	1
thought	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
happening	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
mental	1
efforts	1
to	1
go	1
along	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
calm	1
stern	1
face	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
all	1
was	1
growing	1
clearer	1
and	1
clearer	1
that	1
was	1
still	1
as	1
dark	1
as	1
ever	1
for	1
levin	1
yes	1
yes	1
so	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
articulated	1
slowly	1
at	1
intervals	1
wait	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
right	1
he	1
pronounced	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
reassuringly	1
as	1
though	1
all	1
were	1
solved	1
for	1
him	1
o	1
lord	1
he	1
murmured	1
and	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
felt	1
his	1
feet	1
they	1
re	1
getting	1
cold	1
she	1
whispered	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
while	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
lay	1
motionless	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
alive	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
sighed	1
levin	1
by	1
now	1
was	1
exhausted	1
from	1
mental	1
strain	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
with	1
no	1
mental	1
effort	1
could	1
he	1
understand	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
right	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
death	1
itself	1
but	1
with	1
no	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
kept	1
coming	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
next	1
closing	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
s	1
eyes	1
dressing	1
him	1
ordering	1
the	1
coffin	1
and	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
felt	1
utterly	1
cold	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
conscious	1
of	1
sorrow	1
nor	1
of	1
loss	1
less	1
still	1
of	1
pity	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
feeling	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
was	1
envy	1
for	1
the	1
knowledge	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
had	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
more	1
he	1
sat	1
over	1
him	1
so	1
continually	1
expecting	1
the	1
end	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
kitty	1
appeared	1
levin	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
stop	1
her	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
stirring	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
away	1
said	1
nikolay	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
levin	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
and	1
angrily	1
waved	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
sat	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
an	1
hour	1
another	1
hour	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
death	1
at	1
all	1
now	1
he	1
wondered	1
what	1
kitty	1
was	1
doing	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
whether	1
the	1
doctor	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
longed	1
for	1
food	1
and	1
for	1
sleep	1
he	1
cautiously	1
drew	1
away	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
feet	1
the	1
feet	1
were	1
cold	1
but	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
still	1
breathing	1
levin	1
tried	1
again	1
to	1
move	1
away	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
but	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
stirred	1
again	1
and	1
said	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
the	1
dawn	1
came	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
s	1
condition	1
was	1
unchanged	1
levin	1
stealthily	1
withdrew	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
sleep	1
when	1
he	1
woke	1
up	1
instead	1
of	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
death	1
which	1
he	1
expected	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
earlier	1
condition	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
sitting	1
up	1
again	1
coughing	1
had	1
begun	1
eating	1
again	1
talking	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
death	1
again	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
express	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
recovery	1
and	1
had	1
become	1
more	1
irritable	1
and	1
more	1
gloomy	1
than	1
ever	1
no	1
one	1
neither	1
his	1
brother	1
nor	1
kitty	1
could	1
soothe	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
everyone	1
and	1
said	1
nasty	1
things	1
to	1
everyone	1
reproached	1
everyone	1
for	1
his	1
sufferings	1
and	1
insisted	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
get	1
him	1
a	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
from	1
moscow	1
to	1
all	1
inquiries	1
made	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
answer	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
vindictive	1
reproachfulness	1
i	1
m	1
suffering	1
horribly	1
intolerably	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
suffering	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
especially	1
from	1
bedsores	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
now	1
to	1
remedy	1
and	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
angry	1
with	1
everyone	1
about	1
him	1
blaming	1
them	1
for	1
everything	1
and	1
especially	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
doctor	1
from	1
moscow	1
kitty	1
tried	1
in	1
every	1
possible	1
way	1
to	1
relieve	1
him	1
to	1
soothe	1
him	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
vain	1
and	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
exhausted	1
both	1
physically	1
and	1
morally	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
admit	1
it	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
death	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
evoked	1
in	1
all	1
by	1
his	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
life	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
broken	1
up	1
everyone	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
inevitably	1
die	1
soon	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
half	1
dead	1
already	1
everyone	1
wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
die	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
everyone	1
concealing	1
this	1
gave	1
him	1
medicines	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
remedies	1
and	1
doctors	1
and	1
deceived	1
him	1
and	1
themselves	1
and	1
each	1
other	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
falsehood	1
disgusting	1
irreverent	1
deceit	1
and	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
bent	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
more	1
than	1
anyone	1
else	1
did	1
levin	1
was	1
most	1
painfully	1
conscious	1
of	1
this	1
deceit	1
levin	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
reconciling	1
his	1
brothers	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
death	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
having	1
received	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
read	1
this	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
wrote	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
himself	1
and	1
in	1
touching	1
terms	1
he	1
begged	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
forgiveness	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
said	1
nothing	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
said	1
levin	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
no	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
nikolay	1
answered	1
vexed	1
at	1
the	1
question	1
tell	1
him	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
a	1
doctor	1
three	1
more	1
days	1
of	1
agony	1
followed	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
condition	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
longing	1
for	1
his	1
death	1
was	1
felt	1
by	1
everyone	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
waiters	1
and	1
the	1
hotel	1
keeper	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
staying	1
in	1
the	1
hotel	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
and	1
levin	1
and	1
kitty	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
alone	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
this	1
feeling	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
furious	1
at	1
their	1
not	1
getting	1
him	1
doctors	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
taking	1
medicine	1
and	1
talking	1
of	1
life	1
only	1
at	1
rare	1
moments	1
when	1
the	1
opium	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
relief	1
from	1
the	1
never	1
ceasing	1
pain	1
he	1
would	1
sometimes	1
half	1
asleep	1
utter	1
what	1
was	1
ever	1
more	1
intense	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
than	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
oh	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
the	1
end	1
or	1
when	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
over	1
his	1
sufferings	1
steadily	1
growing	1
more	1
intense	1
did	1
their	1
work	1
and	1
prepared	1
him	1
for	1
death	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
pain	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
minute	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
unconscious	1
of	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
limb	1
not	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
ache	1
and	1
cause	1
him	1
agony	1
even	1
the	1
memories	1
the	1
impressions	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
this	1
body	1
awakened	1
in	1
him	1
now	1
the	1
same	1
aversion	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
itself	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
their	1
remarks	1
his	1
own	1
reminiscences	1
everything	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
agony	1
those	1
about	1
him	1
felt	1
this	1
and	1
instinctively	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
themselves	1
to	1
move	1
freely	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
wishes	1
before	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
merged	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
feeling	1
of	1
suffering	1
and	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
evidently	1
coming	1
over	1
him	1
that	1
revulsion	1
that	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
look	1
upon	1
death	1
as	1
the	1
goal	1
of	1
his	1
desires	1
as	1
happiness	1
hitherto	1
each	1
individual	1
desire	1
aroused	1
by	1
suffering	1
or	1
privation	1
such	1
as	1
hunger	1
fatigue	1
thirst	1
had	1
been	1
satisfied	1
by	1
some	1
bodily	1
function	1
giving	1
pleasure	1
but	1
now	1
no	1
physical	1
craving	1
or	1
suffering	1
received	1
relief	1
and	1
the	1
effort	1
to	1
relieve	1
them	1
only	1
caused	1
fresh	1
suffering	1
and	1
so	1
all	1
desires	1
were	1
merged	1
in	1
one	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
sufferings	1
and	1
their	1
source	1
the	1
body	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
words	1
to	1
express	1
this	1
desire	1
of	1
deliverance	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
asked	1
for	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
desires	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
satisfied	1
turn	1
me	1
over	1
on	1
the	1

he	1
would	1

and	1
immediately	1
after	1
he	1
would	1
ask	1
to	1
be	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
as	1
before	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
broth	1
take	1
away	1
the	1

talk	1
of	1
something	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
silent	1
and	1
directly	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
he	1
would	1
close	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
would	1
show	1
weariness	1
indifference	1
and	1
loathing	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
from	1
their	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
town	1
kitty	1
was	1
unwell	1
she	1
suffered	1
from	1
headache	1
and	1
sickness	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
doctor	1
opined	1
that	1
the	1
indisposition	1
arose	1
from	1
fatigue	1
and	1
excitement	1
and	1
prescribed	1
rest	1
after	1
dinner	1
however	1
kitty	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
as	1
usual	1
with	1
her	1
work	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
sternly	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
when	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unwell	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
blowing	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
groaning	1
piteously	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
worse	1
he	1
articulated	1
with	1
difficulty	1
in	1
pain	1
in	1
pain	1
where	1
everywhere	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
over	1
today	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
said	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
whose	1
hearing	1
levin	1
had	1
noticed	1
was	1
very	1
keen	1
must	1
have	1
heard	1
levin	1
said	1
hush	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
nikolay	1
had	1
heard	1
but	1
these	1
words	1
produced	1
no	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
his	1
eyes	1
had	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
intense	1
reproachful	1
look	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
levin	1
asked	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
he	1
has	1
begun	1
picking	1
at	1
himself	1
said	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
like	1
this	1
she	1
said	1
tugging	1
at	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
woolen	1
skirt	1
levin	1
noticed	1
indeed	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
patient	1
pulled	1
at	1
himself	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
snatch	1
something	1
away	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
s	1
prediction	1
came	1
true	1
towards	1
night	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
lift	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
could	1
only	1
gaze	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
intensely	1
concentrated	1
expression	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
even	1
when	1
his	1
brother	1
or	1
kitty	1
bent	1
over	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
them	1
he	1
looked	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
kitty	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
priest	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
dying	1
while	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
reading	1
it	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
life	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed	1
levin	1
kitty	1
and	1
marya	1
nikolaevna	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
bedside	1
the	1
priest	1
had	1
not	1
quite	1
finished	1
reading	1
the	1
prayer	1
when	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
stretched	1
sighed	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
the	1
priest	1
on	1
finishing	1
the	1
prayer	1
put	1
the	1
cross	1
to	1
the	1
cold	1
forehead	1
then	1
slowly	1
returned	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
stand	1
and	1
after	1
standing	1
for	1
two	1
minutes	1
more	1
in	1
silence	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
huge	1
bloodless	1
hand	1
that	1
was	1
turning	1
cold	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
moved	1
away	1
but	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
faint	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
mustaches	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
that	1
seemed	1
glued	1
together	1
and	1
quite	1
distinctly	1
in	1
the	1
hush	1
they	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
chest	1
the	1
sharply	1
defined	1
sounds	1
not	1
quite	1
soon	1
and	1
a	1
minute	1
later	1
the	1
face	1
brightened	1
a	1
smile	1
came	1
out	1
under	1
the	1
mustaches	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
round	1
began	1
carefully	1
laying	1
out	1
the	1
corpse	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
death	1
revived	1
in	1
levin	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
horror	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
insoluble	1
enigma	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
nearness	1
and	1
inevitability	1
of	1
death	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
autumn	1
evening	1
when	1
his	1
brother	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
this	1
feeling	1
was	1
now	1
even	1
stronger	1
than	1
before	1
even	1
less	1
than	1
before	1
did	1
he	1
feel	1
capable	1
of	1
apprehending	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
its	1
inevitability	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
him	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
ever	1
but	1
now	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
presence	1
that	1
feeling	1
did	1
not	1
reduce	1
him	1
to	1
despair	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
death	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
love	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
love	1
saved	1
him	1
from	1
despair	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
love	1
under	1
the	1
menace	1
of	1
despair	1
had	1
become	1
still	1
stronger	1
and	1
purer	1
the	1
one	1
mystery	1
of	1
death	1
still	1
unsolved	1
had	1
scarcely	1
passed	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
when	1
another	1
mystery	1
had	1
arisen	1
as	1
insoluble	1
urging	1
him	1
to	1
love	1
and	1
to	1
life	1
the	1
doctor	1
confirmed	1
his	1
suppositions	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
kitty	1
her	1
indisposition	1
was	1
a	1
symptom	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
child	1
chapter	1
21	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
understood	1
from	1
his	1
interviews	1
with	1
betsy	1
and	1
with	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
peace	1
without	1
burdening	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
herself	1
desired	1
this	1
he	1
felt	1
so	1
distraught	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
come	1
to	1
no	1
decision	1
of	1
himself	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
himself	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
now	1
and	1
putting	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
so	1
pleased	1
to	1
interest	1
themselves	1
in	1
his	1
affairs	1
he	1
met	1
everything	1
with	1
unqualified	1
assent	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
anna	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
sent	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
whether	1
she	1
should	1
dine	1
with	1
him	1
or	1
separately	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
clearly	1
comprehended	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
was	1
appalled	1
by	1
it	1
most	1
difficult	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
this	1
position	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
connect	1
and	1
reconcile	1
his	1
past	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
past	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
happily	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
troubled	1
him	1
the	1
transition	1
from	1
that	1
past	1
to	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
unfaithfulness	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
miserably	1
already	1
that	1
state	1
was	1
painful	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
understand	1
it	1
if	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
then	1
on	1
declaring	1
to	1
him	1
her	1
unfaithfulness	1
left	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
wounded	1
unhappy	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
hopeless	1
position	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
now	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
reconcile	1
his	1
immediate	1
past	1
his	1
tenderness	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
sick	1
wife	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
man	1
s	1
child	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
case	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
he	1
now	1
found	1
himself	1
alone	1
put	1
to	1
shame	1
a	1
laughing	1
stock	1
needed	1
by	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
despised	1
by	1
everyone	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
days	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
departure	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
received	1
applicants	1
for	1
assistance	1
and	1
his	1
chief	1
secretary	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
committee	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
dinner	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
as	1
usual	1
without	1
giving	1
himself	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
he	1
strained	1
every	1
nerve	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
for	1
those	1
two	1
days	1
simply	1
to	1
preserve	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
composure	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
indifference	1
answering	1
inquiries	1
about	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
s	1
rooms	1
and	1
belongings	1
he	1
had	1
exercised	1
immense	1
self	1
control	1
to	1
appear	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
whose	1
eyes	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
was	1
not	1
unforeseen	1
nor	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
and	1
he	1
attained	1
his	1
aim	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
detected	1
in	1
him	1
signs	1
of	1
despair	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
after	1
her	1
departure	1
when	1
korney	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
bill	1
from	1
a	1
fashionable	1
draper	1
s	1
shop	1
which	1
anna	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
pay	1
and	1
announced	1
that	1
the	1
clerk	1
from	1
the	1
shop	1
was	1
waiting	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
clerk	1
up	1
excuse	1
me	1
your	1
excellency	1
for	1
venturing	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
direct	1
us	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
her	1
excellency	1
would	1
you	1
graciously	1
oblige	1
us	1
with	1
her	1
address	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
pondered	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
clerk	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
turning	1
round	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
letting	1
his	1
head	1
sink	1
into	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
in	1
that	1
position	1
several	1
times	1
attempted	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
korney	1
perceiving	1
his	1
master	1
s	1
emotion	1
asked	1
the	1
clerk	1
to	1
call	1
another	1
time	1
left	1
alone	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
recognized	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
firmness	1
and	1
composure	1
any	1
longer	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
was	1
awaiting	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
back	1
and	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
admitted	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
dinner	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
universal	1
contempt	1
and	1
exasperation	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
distinctly	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
clerk	1
and	1
of	1
korney	1
and	1
of	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
during	1
those	1
two	1
days	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
turn	1
aside	1
from	1
himself	1
the	1
hatred	1
of	1
men	1
because	1
that	1
hatred	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
his	1
being	1
bad	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
but	1
from	1
his	1
being	1
shamefully	1
and	1
repulsively	1
unhappy	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
this	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
torn	1
with	1
grief	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
merciless	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
men	1
would	1
crush	1
him	1
as	1
dogs	1
strangle	1
a	1
torn	1
dog	1
yelping	1
with	1
pain	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
sole	1
means	1
of	1
security	1
against	1
people	1
was	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
wounds	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
instinctively	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
incapable	1
of	1
keeping	1
up	1
the	1
unequal	1
struggle	1
his	1
despair	1
was	1
even	1
intensified	1
by	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
utterly	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
sorrow	1
in	1
all	1
petersburg	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
express	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
feeling	1
who	1
would	1
feel	1
for	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
high	1
official	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
society	1
but	1
simply	1
as	1
a	1
suffering	1
man	1
indeed	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
in	1
the	1

alexey	1

in	1

anna	1

through	1
a	1

that	1

an	1

he	1
made	1
the	1
offer	1

concentrated	1
on	1

feeling	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
capable	1

in	1

every	1

and	1
now	1
among	1
all	1
his	1

he	1
had	1
not	1
one	1

he	1
had	1
plenty	1
of	1
so	1
called	1
connections	1
but	1
no	1
friendships	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
plenty	1
of	1
people	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
invite	1
to	1
dinner	1
to	1
whose	1
sympathy	1
he	1
could	1
appeal	1
in	1
any	1
public	1

he	1
could	1
candidly	1

other	1

affairs	1

his	1
relations	1
with	1
these	1

were	1
confined	1
to	1
one	1
clearly	1
defined	1
channel	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
certain	1
routine	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
depart	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
man	1
a	1
comrade	1
of	1
his	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
friends	1
later	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
a	1
personal	1
sorrow	1
but	1
this	1
friend	1
had	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
the	1
department	1

education	1
in	1
a	1
remote	1
part	1
of	1
russia	1
of	1

most	1
possible	1
were	1
his	1
chief	1
secretary	1

his	1
doctor	1
mihail	1

sludin	1
the	1
chief	1

was	1
a	1
straightforward	1
intelligent	1
good	1
hearted	1
and	1
conscientious	1
man	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
personal	1
goodwill	1
but	1
their	1
five	1
years	1
of	1
official	1
work	1
together	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
put	1
a	1
barrier	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
cut	1
off	1
warmer	1
relations	1
after	1
signing	1
the	1
papers	1
brought	1
him	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
in	1
silence	1
glancing	1
at	1
mihail	1
vassilievitch	1
and	1
several	1
times	1
he	1
attempted	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
prepared	1
the	1
phrase	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
trouble	1
but	1
he	1
ended	1
by	1
saying	1
as	1
usual	1
so	1
you	1
ll	1
get	1
this	1
ready	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
dismissed	1

was	1
the	1
doctor	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
a	1
kindly	1
feeling	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
there	1
had	1
long	1
existed	1
a	1
taciturn	1
understanding	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
both	1
were	1
weighed	1
down	1
by	1
work	1
and	1
always	1
in	1
a	1

off	1

and	1
suddenly	1
her	1
eyebrows	1
rose	1
at	1
the	1
inner	1
corners	1
describing	1
a	1
triangle	1
on	1
her	1
forehead	1
her	1
ugly	1
yellow	1
face	1
became	1
still	1
uglier	1
but	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
cry	1

he	1

was	1

snatched	1
her	1
plump	1
hand	1
and	1
proceeded	1
to	1

it	1
dear	1

said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
breaking	1
with	1
emotion	1
you	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
grief	1
your	1
sorrow	1
is	1

consolation	1

no	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
letting	1
go	1
her	1
hand	1
but	1
still	1
gazing	1
into	1
her	1
brimming	1
eyes	1
my	1
position	1
is	1
so	1
awful	1
because	1
i	1
can	1
find	1
nowhere	1
i	1
cannot	1
find	1
within	1
me	1
strength	1
to	1
support	1

to	1

in	1
my	1

with	1
a	1
sigh	1
our	1
support	1

that	1
love	1
that	1

the	1
look	1
of	1
ecstasy	1

knew	1
so	1
well	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
your	1

your	1
succor	1
although	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
a	1
flavor	1
of	1
that	1
sentimental	1
emotion	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
lofty	1
feelings	1
and	1
that	1
new	1
mystical	1
fervor	1
which	1
had	1
lately	1
gained	1
ground	1
in	1
petersburg	1
and	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
disproportionate	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
this	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
weak	1
i	1

i	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1

it	1
at	1
dinner	1
yesterday	1
i	1
was	1
almost	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dinner	1
table	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
way	1
my	1
son	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
me	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1

he	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
look	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
me	1

that	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
would	1
have	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
bill	1
that	1
had	1

brought	1
him	1
but	1
his	1
voice	1
shook	1
and	1
he	1
stopped	1
that	1
bill	1
on	1
blue	1
paper	1
for	1
a	1
hat	1
and	1
ribbons	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
recall	1
without	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
self	1

we	1

to	1
the	1

you	1

she	1
said	1
and	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
heavenwards	1
she	1
began	1
praying	1
as	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
gathered	1
from	1
her	1
silence	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
and	1
those	1
expressions	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
not	1
distasteful	1
at	1
least	1
exaggerated	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
natural	1
and	1
consolatory	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
disliked	1
this	1
new	1
enthusiastic	1
fervor	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
believer	1
who	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
religion	1
primarily	1
in	1
its	1
political	1
aspect	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
doctrine	1
which	1
ventured	1
upon	1
several	1
new	1
interpretations	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
paved	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
discussion	1
and	1
analysis	1
was	1
in	1
principle	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
hitherto	1
taken	1
up	1
a	1
cold	1
and	1
even	1
antagonistic	1
attitude	1
to	1
this	1
new	1
doctrine	1
and	1
with	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
argued	1
but	1
by	1
silence	1
had	1
assiduously	1
parried	1
her	1
attempts	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
into	1
argument	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
heard	1
her	1
words	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
inwardly	1
oppose	1
them	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
both	1
for	1
your	1
deeds	1

for	1

said	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
praying	1

lidia	1
ivanovna	1
once	1
more	1
pressed	1

she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
as	1
she	1
wiped	1
away	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1

was	1
dead	1

of	1
alexey	1

not	1
overstated	1
the	1

were	1
not	1
her	1
strong	1
point	1
all	1
her	1
arrangements	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
modified	1
because	1
they	1
could	1

they	1
were	1
modified	1
by	1

valet	1
who	1
though	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
now	1
managed	1
karenin	1
s	1

quietly	1

discreetly	1
reported	1
to	1
his	1

while	1
he	1
was	1
dressing	1
all	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
know	1
but	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
s	1
help	1
was	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
real	1
she	1
gave	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
moral	1
support	1
in	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
soothing	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
that	1
she	1
almost	1
turned	1
him	1
to	1
christianity	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
an	1
indifferent	1
and	1
apathetic	1
believer	1
she	1
turned	1
him	1
into	1
an	1
ardent	1
and	1
steadfast	1
adherent	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
interpretation	1
of	1
christian	1
doctrine	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
gaining	1
ground	1
of	1
late	1
in	1
petersburg	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
for	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
this	1
teaching	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
like	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
indeed	1
and	1
others	1
who	1
shared	1
their	1

completely	1
devoid	1

spiritual	1
faculty	1
in	1

of	1
which	1
the	1
conceptions	1
evoked	1
by	1

so	1

that	1

must	1
needs	1
be	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
other	1
conceptions	1
and	1
with	1
actual	1
fact	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
impossible	1
and	1
inconceivable	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
death	1
though	1
existing	1
for	1
unbelievers	1
did	1
not	1
exist	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
the	1
judge	1
therefore	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sin	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
experiencing	1
complete	1
salvation	1
here	1
on	1

it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
erroneousness	1
and	1
shallowness	1
of	1
this	1
conception	1
of	1
his	1
faith	1
was	1
dimly	1
perceptible	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
idea	1
that	1
his	1
forgiveness	1
was	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
a	1
higher	1
power	1
he	1
had	1
surrendered	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
more	1
happiness	1
than	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
every	1
instant	1
that	1
christ	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
signing	1
official	1
papers	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
his	1
will	1
but	1
for	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
necessity	1
to	1
think	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
necessity	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
humiliation	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
elevated	1
standpoint	1
however	1
imaginary	1
from	1
which	1
looked	1
down	1
upon	1
by	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
look	1
down	1
on	1
others	1
that	1
he	1
clung	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
one	1
salvation	1
to	1
his	1
delusion	1
of	1
salvation	1

the	1

which	1
was	1

constantly	1
waning	1

the	1

relations	1
with	1

the	1

was	1

overjoyed	1
at	1

in	1
his	1

signs	1
of	1

impression	1

on	1

in	1

whole	1

that	1

for	1
a	1

to	1

incessantly	1

fault	1

his	1

never	1
interrupting	1
his	1

for	1
an	1
instant	1
for	1
fear	1
he	1
should	1
escape	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
left	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
there	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
bitterest	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
an	1
official	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
his	1
upward	1
career	1
comes	1
to	1
a	1
full	1
stop	1
this	1
full	1
stop	1
had	1
arrived	1
and	1
everyone	1
perceived	1
it	1
but	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
himself	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
aware	1
that	1
his	1
career	1
was	1
over	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
feud	1
with	1
stremov	1
or	1
his	1
misfortune	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
or	1
simply	1
that	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
reached	1
his	1
destined	1
limits	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
evident	1
to	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
that	1
his	1
career	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
he	1
still	1
filled	1
a	1
position	1
of	1
consequence	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
many	1
commissions	1
and	1
committees	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
day	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
from	1
whom	1
nothing	1
was	1
expected	1
whatever	1
he	1
said	1
whatever	1
he	1
proposed	1
was	1
heard	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
long	1
familiar	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
needed	1
but	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
being	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
direct	1
participation	1
in	1
governmental	1
activity	1
he	1
saw	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
ever	1
the	1
errors	1
and	1
defects	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
others	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
means	1
for	1
their	1
correction	1
shortly	1
after	1
his	1
separation	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
began	1
writing	1
his	1
first	1
note	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
judicial	1
procedure	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
endless	1
series	1
of	1
notes	1
he	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
write	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
fail	1
to	1
observe	1
his	1
hopeless	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
official	1
world	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
free	1
from	1
anxiety	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
he	1
was	1
positively	1
more	1
satisfied	1
than	1
ever	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
activity	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
unmarried	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
lord	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
the	1
lord	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
his	1
wife	1
says	1
the	1
apostle	1
paul	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
guided	1
in	1
every	1
action	1
by	1
scripture	1
often	1
recalled	1
this	1
text	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
without	1
a	1
wife	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
these	1
very	1
projects	1
of	1
reform	1
been	1
serving	1
the	1
lord	1
more	1
zealously	1
than	1
before	1
the	1
unmistakable	1
impatience	1
of	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
trouble	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
his	1
exposition	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
seizing	1
his	1
chance	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
imperial	1
family	1
was	1
passing	1
slipped	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
left	1
alone	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
looked	1
down	1
collecting	1
his	1
thoughts	1
then	1
looked	1
casually	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
where	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
meet	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
and	1
how	1
strong	1
they	1
all	1
are	1
how	1
sound	1
physically	1
thought	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
powerfully	1
built	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
with	1
his	1
well	1
combed	1
perfumed	1
whiskers	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
red	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
pinched	1
by	1
his	1
tight	1
uniform	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
pass	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
truly	1
is	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
evil	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
another	1
sidelong	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
calves	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
moving	1
forward	1
deliberately	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
bowed	1
with	1
his	1
customary	1
air	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
dignity	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
his	1
eyes	1
sought	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
ah	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
malicious	1
light	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
karenin	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
was	1
nodding	1
with	1
a	1
frigid	1
gesture	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
congratulated	1
you	1
yet	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
newly	1
received	1
ribbon	1
thank	1
you	1
answered	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
what	1
an	1
exquisite	1
day	1
today	1
he	1
added	1
laying	1
emphasis	1
in	1
his	1
peculiar	1
way	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
exquisite	1
that	1
they	1
laughed	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
anything	1
but	1
hostility	1
from	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
by	1
now	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
yellow	1
shoulders	1
of	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
jutting	1
out	1
above	1
her	1
corset	1
and	1
her	1
fine	1
pensive	1
eyes	1
bidding	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
smiled	1
revealing	1
untarnished	1
white	1
teeth	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
her	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
s	1
dress	1
had	1
cost	1
her	1
great	1
pains	1
as	1
indeed	1
all	1
her	1
dresses	1
had	1
done	1
of	1
late	1
her	1
aim	1
in	1
dress	1
was	1
now	1
quite	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
pursued	1
thirty	1
years	1
before	1
then	1
her	1
desire	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
adorn	1
herself	1
with	1
something	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
adorned	1
the	1
better	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
was	1
perforce	1
decked	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
so	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
her	1
age	1
and	1
her	1
figure	1
that	1
her	1
one	1
anxiety	1
was	1
to	1
contrive	1
that	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
these	1
adornments	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
exterior	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
appalling	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
concerned	1
she	1
succeeded	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
attractive	1
for	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
island	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
goodwill	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
of	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
hostility	1
and	1
jeering	1
that	1
surrounded	1
him	1
passing	1
through	1
rows	1
of	1
ironical	1
eyes	1
he	1
was	1
drawn	1
as	1
naturally	1
to	1
her	1
loving	1
glance	1
as	1
a	1
plant	1
to	1
the	1
sun	1
i	1
congratulate	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
ribbon	1
suppressing	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
joy	1
to	1
him	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
chief	1
sources	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
though	1
he	1
never	1
admitted	1
it	1
how	1
is	1
our	1

sort	1
of	1

questions	1

to	1
touch	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
every	1

and	1
every	1
child	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
began	1
expounding	1
his	1
views	1
on	1
the	1
sole	1
question	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
besides	1
the	1
service	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
when	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
with	1

s	1
help	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
back	1
anew	1
to	1
life	1

felt	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
undertake	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
left	1
on	1
his	1

having	1
never	1
before	1
taken	1
any	1
interest	1
in	1
educational	1
questions	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
devoted	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
theoretical	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
after	1
reading	1
several	1
books	1
on	1
anthropology	1
education	1
and	1
didactics	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
education	1
and	1
engaging	1
the	1
best	1
tutor	1
in	1
petersburg	1
to	1
superintend	1
it	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
the	1
subject	1
continually	1
absorbed	1
him	1
yes	1
but	1
the	1
heart	1
i	1
see	1
in	1
him	1
his	1

heart	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
heart	1
a	1
child	1
cannot	1
go	1

with	1

yes	1

as	1
for	1
me	1

a	1
pause	1
we	1
have	1
to	1

of	1
a	1

painful	1
for	1
you	1
i	1
would	1
give	1
anything	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1

but	1
immediately	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
the	1
deathlike	1
rigidity	1
which	1
expressed	1
utter	1
helplessness	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1

was	1
expecting	1

at	1
him	1
ecstatically	1
and	1
tears	1

limits	1
to	1
everything	1

that	1
which	1

towards	1

concealed	1
from	1

the	1

for	1

part	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
on	1
returning	1
home	1
from	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
s	1
could	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
concentrate	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
usual	1
pursuits	1
and	1
find	1
that	1
spiritual	1
peace	1
of	1
one	1
saved	1
and	1
believing	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
of	1
late	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
greatly	1
sinned	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
towards	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
saintly	1
as	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
had	1
so	1
justly	1
told	1
him	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
troubled	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
easy	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
book	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
drive	1
away	1
harassing	1
recollections	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
mistake	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
now	1
seemed	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
her	1
confession	1
of	1
infidelity	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
races	1
especially	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
insisted	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
observance	1
of	1
external	1
decorum	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
sent	1
a	1
challenge	1
tortured	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
remorse	1
he	1
was	1
tortured	1
too	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
her	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
forgiveness	1
which	1
nobody	1
wanted	1
and	1
his	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
man	1
s	1
child	1
made	1
his	1
heart	1
burn	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
remorse	1
and	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
regret	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
reviewed	1
all	1
his	1
past	1
with	1
her	1
recalling	1
the	1
awkward	1
words	1
in	1
which	1
after	1
long	1
wavering	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
but	1
how	1
have	1
i	1
been	1
to	1
blame	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
this	1
question	1
always	1
excited	1
another	1
question	1
in	1
him	1
whether	1
they	1
felt	1
differently	1
did	1
their	1
loving	1
and	1
marrying	1
differently	1
these	1
vronskys	1
and	1
oblonskys	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
with	1
their	1
fine	1
calves	1
and	1
there	1
passed	1
before	1
his	1
mind	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
these	1
mettlesome	1
vigorous	1
self	1
confident	1
men	1
who	1
always	1
and	1
everywhere	1
drew	1
his	1
inquisitive	1
attention	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
dispel	1
these	1
thoughts	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
living	1
for	1
this	1
transient	1
life	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
eternity	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
and	1
love	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
this	1
transient	1
trivial	1
life	1
made	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
trivial	1
mistakes	1
tortured	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
eternal	1
salvation	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
believed	1
had	1
no	1
existence	1
but	1
this	1
temptation	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long	1
and	1
soon	1
there	1
was	1
reestablished	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
soul	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
the	1
elevation	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
forget	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
remember	1

feeble	1
voice	1
did	1
not	1

of	1
the	1

gazing	1

do	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
for	1
him	1
the	1

nodded	1
his	1
head	1
affirmatively	1
the	1
clerk	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
tied	1
up	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
seven	1
times	1
to	1
ask	1
some	1
favor	1
of	1
alexey	1

interested	1
both	1

and	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
seryozha	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
had	1
heard	1
him	1
plaintively	1
beg	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
to	1
announce	1
him	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
had	1
death	1
staring	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
since	1

seryozha	1
having	1
met	1
him	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
in	1
the	1

took	1
great	1

in	1
him	1
well	1
was	1
he	1
very	1
glad	1
he	1
asked	1
glad	1
i	1
should	1

almost	1
dancing	1
as	1
he	1

and	1
has	1
anything	1
been	1
left	1
asked	1
seryozha	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
come	1
sir	1
said	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
shake	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
whispered	1
something	1
from	1
the	1
countess	1
seryozha	1
understood	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
was	1
a	1
present	1
from	1

said	1
the	1
porter	1
hearing	1
the	1
tutor	1
s	1
steps	1
approaching	1
and	1
carefully	1
taking	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
belt	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
glove	1
half	1
pulled	1
off	1
he	1
signed	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
towards	1
the	1
tutor	1
vassily	1
lukitch	1
in	1
a	1
tiny	1
minute	1
answered	1
seryozha	1
with	1
that	1
gay	1
and	1
loving	1
smile	1
which	1
always	1
won	1
over	1
the	1
conscientious	1
vassily	1
lukitch	1
seryozha	1
was	1
too	1
happy	1
everything	1
was	1
too	1
delightful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
help	1
sharing	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
porter	1
the	1
family	1
good	1
fortune	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
during	1
his	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
gardens	1
from	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
s	1
niece	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
good	1
news	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
particularly	1
important	1
from	1
its	1
coming	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
gladness	1
of	1
the	1
bandaged	1
clerk	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
gladness	1
at	1
toys	1
having	1
come	1
for	1
him	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
seryozha	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
everyone	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
happy	1
you	1

at	1
the	1

think	1
so	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
proof	1
he	1
s	1
deserved	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
porter	1
severely	1
and	1
seriously	1
seryozha	1
fell	1
to	1
dreaming	1
gazing	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
porter	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
thoroughly	1
studied	1
in	1
every	1
detail	1
especially	1
the	1
chin	1
that	1
hung	1
down	1
between	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
never	1
seen	1
by	1
anyone	1
but	1
seryozha	1
who	1
saw	1

instead	1
of	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1

told	1
his	1

of	1

inquired	1

vassily	1
lukitch	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1

the	1
necessity	1
of	1

he	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
seated	1
at	1
their	1
work	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
his	1

papa	1
s	1
received	1
the	1
alexander	1
nevsky	1
vassily	1
lukitch	1
replied	1
that	1
the	1
vladimir	1
was	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
alexander	1
nevsky	1
and	1
higher	1
still	1
well	1
highest	1
of	1
all	1

than	1

what	1

and	1
seryozha	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbows	1
sank	1
into	1
deep	1
meditation	1
his	1
meditations	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
complex	1
and	1
diverse	1
character	1
he	1
imagined	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
having	1
suddenly	1
been	1
presented	1
with	1
both	1
the	1
vladimir	1
and	1
the	1
andrey	1
today	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
being	1
much	1
better	1
tempered	1
at	1
his	1
lesson	1
and	1
dreamed	1
how	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
grown	1
up	1
he	1
would	1
himself	1
receive	1
all	1
the	1
orders	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
invent	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
andrey	1
directly	1
any	1
higher	1
order	1
were	1
invented	1
he	1
would	1
win	1
it	1
they	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
higher	1
one	1
still	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
immediately	1
win	1
that	1
too	1
the	1
time	1
passed	1
in	1
such	1
meditations	1
and	1
when	1
the	1

came	1
the	1

about	1
the	1
adverbs	1
of	1
place	1
and	1
time	1

manner	1
of	1

the	1

was	1
not	1

displeased	1

hurt	1
this	1
touched	1
seryozha	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
learned	1
the	1
lesson	1
however	1
much	1
he	1
tried	1
he	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
teacher	1
was	1
explaining	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
believed	1
him	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
comprehend	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
he	1
was	1
positively	1
unable	1
to	1
recollect	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
short	1
and	1
familiar	1
word	1

is	1
an	1
adverb	1
of	1

was	1
sorry	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
disappointed	1
the	1

he	1
chose	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1

was	1
looking	1
in	1
silence	1
at	1
the	1
book	1

looked	1
intently	1
at	1
the	1

at	1
his	1
scanty	1

at	1
his	1
spectacles	1
which	1
had	1
slipped	1
down	1
below	1
the	1
ridge	1
on	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
so	1
deep	1
a	1
reverie	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
the	1

was	1

from	1
the	1

why	1

for	1

seryozha	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
playing	1
with	1
a	1
penknife	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
dreaming	1
among	1
seryozha	1
s	1
favorite	1
occupations	1
was	1
searching	1
for	1
his	1
mother	1
during	1
his	1
walks	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
death	1
generally	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
death	1
in	1
particular	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
what	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
confirmed	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
she	1
was	1
dead	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
looking	1
for	1
her	1
when	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
every	1
woman	1
of	1
full	1
graceful	1
figure	1
with	1
dark	1
hair	1
was	1
his	1
mother	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
such	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
tenderness	1
was	1
stirred	1
within	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
breath	1
failed	1
him	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
tiptoe	1
of	1
expectation	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
would	1
lift	1
her	1
veil	1
all	1
her	1
face	1
would	1
be	1
visible	1
she	1
would	1
smile	1
she	1
would	1
hug	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
sniff	1
her	1
fragrance	1
feel	1
the	1
softness	1
of	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
cry	1
with	1
happiness	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
evening	1
lain	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
while	1
she	1
tickled	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
laughed	1
and	1
bit	1
her	1
white	1
ring	1
covered	1
fingers	1
later	1
when	1
he	1
accidentally	1
learned	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
nurse	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
not	1
dead	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
had	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dead	1
to	1
him	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
wicked	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
believe	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
seeking	1
her	1
and	1
expecting	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
gardens	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
lilac	1
veil	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
watched	1
with	1
a	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
believing	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
she	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
towards	1
them	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
the	1
lady	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
had	1
disappeared	1
somewhere	1
that	1
day	1
more	1
intensely	1
than	1
ever	1
seryozha	1
felt	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
now	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
forgot	1
everything	1
and	1
cut	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
penknife	1
staring	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
and	1
dreaming	1
of	1
her	1
here	1
is	1
your	1
papa	1
said	1
vassily	1
lukitch	1
rousing	1
him	1
seryozha	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
kissing	1
his	1
hand	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
intently	1
trying	1
to	1
discover	1
signs	1
of	1
his	1
joy	1
at	1
receiving	1
the	1
alexander	1
nevsky	1
did	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
nice	1
walk	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
easy	1
chair	1
pulling	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
testament	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
opening	1
it	1
although	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
told	1
seryozha	1
that	1
every	1
christian	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
scripture	1
history	1
thoroughly	1
he	1
often	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
bible	1
himself	1
during	1
the	1
lesson	1
and	1
seryozha	1
observed	1
this	1
yes	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
nice	1
indeed	1
papa	1
said	1
seryozha	1
sitting	1
sideways	1
on	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
rocking	1
it	1
which	1
was	1
forbidden	1
i	1
saw	1
nadinka	1
nadinka	1
was	1
a	1
niece	1
of	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
s	1
who	1
was	1
being	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
house	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
d	1
been	1
given	1
a	1
new	1
star	1
are	1
you	1
glad	1
papa	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
don	1
t	1
rock	1
your	1
chair	1
please	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
secondly	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
reward	1
that	1
s	1
precious	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
itself	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
wished	1
you	1
understood	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
now	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
study	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
win	1
a	1
reward	1
then	1
the	1
work	1
will	1
seem	1
hard	1
to	1
you	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
work	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sustained	1
by	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
duty	1
through	1
the	1
wearisome	1
labor	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
consisting	1
of	1
signing	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
eighty	1
papers	1
loving	1
your	1
work	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
your	1
reward	1
in	1
it	1
seryozha	1
s	1
eyes	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
shining	1
with	1
gaiety	1
and	1
tenderness	1
grew	1
dull	1
and	1
dropped	1
before	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
gaze	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
long	1
familiar	1
tone	1
his	1
father	1
always	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
seryozha	1
had	1
learned	1
by	1
now	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
it	1
his	1
father	1
always	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
seryozha	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
addressing	1
some	1
boy	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
imagination	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
boys	1
that	1
exist	1
in	1
books	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
himself	1
and	1
seryozha	1
always	1
tried	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
act	1
being	1
the	1
story	1
book	1
boy	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
i	1
hope	1
said	1
his	1
father	1
yes	1
papa	1
answered	1
seryozha	1
acting	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
imaginary	1
boy	1
the	1
lesson	1
consisted	1
of	1
learning	1
by	1
heart	1
several	1
verses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
and	1
the	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
testament	1
the	1
verses	1
from	1
the	1
gospel	1
seryozha	1
knew	1
fairly	1
well	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
them	1
he	1
became	1
so	1
absorbed	1
in	1
watching	1
the	1
sharply	1
protruding	1
bony	1
knobbiness	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
forehead	1
that	1
he	1
lost	1
the	1
thread	1
and	1
he	1
transposed	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
one	1
verse	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
another	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
and	1
that	1
irritated	1
him	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
began	1
explaining	1
what	1
seryozha	1
had	1
heard	1
many	1
times	1
before	1
and	1
never	1
could	1
remember	1
because	1
he	1
understood	1
it	1
too	1
well	1
just	1
as	1
that	1
suddenly	1
is	1
an	1
adverb	1
of	1
manner	1
of	1
action	1
seryozha	1
looked	1
with	1
scared	1
eyes	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
whether	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
repeat	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
sometimes	1
did	1
and	1
this	1
thought	1
so	1
alarmed	1
seryozha	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
understood	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
repeat	1
it	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
lesson	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
testament	1
seryozha	1
recounted	1
the	1
events	1
themselves	1
well	1
enough	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
answer	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
certain	1
events	1
prefigured	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
punished	1
over	1
this	1
lesson	1
the	1
passage	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
and	1
began	1
fidgeting	1
and	1
cutting	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
swinging	1
his	1
chair	1
was	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
repeat	1
the	1
patriarchs	1
before	1
the	1
flood	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
except	1
enoch	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
up	1
alive	1
to	1
heaven	1
last	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
remembered	1
their	1
names	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
them	1
utterly	1
chiefly	1
because	1
enoch	1
was	1
the	1
personage	1
he	1
liked	1
best	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
testament	1
and	1
enoch	1
s	1
translation	1
to	1
heaven	1
was	1
connected	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
with	1
a	1
whole	1
long	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
became	1
absorbed	1
now	1
while	1
he	1
gazed	1
with	1
fascinated	1
eyes	1

on	1

death	1
of	1
which	1
they	1

him	1
so	1
often	1
seryozha	1
disbelieved	1
entirely	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
those	1
he	1
loved	1
could	1
die	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
die	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
something	1
utterly	1
inconceivable	1
and	1
impossible	1

he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
die	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
people	1
indeed	1
whom	1
he	1
trusted	1

they	1

confirmed	1
it	1
his	1

nurse	1
too	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
though	1
reluctantly	1

enoch	1
had	1
not	1
died	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
followed	1
that	1
everyone	1
did	1
not	1
die	1
and	1
why	1
cannot	1
anyone	1
else	1
so	1
serve	1
god	1
and	1
be	1
taken	1
alive	1
to	1

those	1

you	1
have	1

that	1
already	1
this	1
is	1

very	1
bad	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
try	1
to	1

you	1

punish	1
you	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
teacher	1
were	1
both	1
displeased	1
with	1
seryozha	1
and	1
he	1
certainly	1
did	1
learn	1
his	1
lessons	1
very	1
badly	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
stupid	1
boy	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
cleverer	1
than	1
the	1
boys	1
his	1
teacher	1
held	1
up	1
as	1
examples	1
to	1
seryozha	1
in	1
his	1

opinion	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
taught	1
in	1
reality	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
because	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
soul	1
were	1
more	1
binding	1
on	1
him	1
than	1
those	1
claims	1
his	1

and	1
his	1
teacher	1
made	1
upon	1
him	1
those	1
claims	1
were	1
in	1
opposition	1

he	1
was	1
in	1
direct	1
conflict	1
with	1
his	1
education	1
he	1
was	1
nine	1
years	1
old	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
child	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
own	1
soul	1
it	1
was	1
precious	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
guarded	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
eyelid	1
guards	1
the	1
eye	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
love	1
he	1
let	1
no	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
soul	1
his	1
teachers	1
complained	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
learn	1
while	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
brimming	1
over	1
with	1
thirst	1
for	1
knowledge	1

he	1
learned	1
from	1
kapitonitch	1
from	1

over	1
this	1

not	1

all	1
the	1

when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
he	1
suddenly	1
remembered	1
her	1
and	1
prayed	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
tomorrow	1
for	1
his	1
birthday	1
might	1
leave	1
off	1

when	1
the	1

and	1
felt	1
his	1

she	1
stood	1
over	1
him	1

with	1
loving	1

him	1

28	1
on	1
arriving	1
in	1
petersburg	1
vronsky	1
and	1
anna	1
stayed	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
hotels	1
vronsky	1
apart	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
story	1
anna	1
above	1
with	1
her	1
child	1
its	1
nurse	1
and	1
her	1
maid	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
suite	1
of	1
four	1
rooms	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
vronsky	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
there	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
moscow	1
on	1
business	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
greeted	1
him	1
as	1
usual	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
stay	1
abroad	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
their	1
common	1
acquaintances	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
drop	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
in	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
anna	1
his	1
brother	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
see	1
vronsky	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
alexey	1
vronsky	1
told	1
him	1
directly	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
upon	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
madame	1
karenina	1
as	1
marriage	1
that	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
and	1
until	1
then	1
he	1
considered	1
her	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
wife	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
wife	1
and	1
he	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
their	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
so	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
disapproves	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
said	1
vronsky	1
but	1
if	1
my	1
relations	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
terms	1
of	1
relationship	1
with	1
me	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
terms	1
with	1
my	1
wife	1
the	1
elder	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
a	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
s	1
judgment	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
tell	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
decided	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
with	1
alexey	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
see	1
anna	1
before	1
his	1
brother	1
as	1
before	1
everyone	1
vronsky	1
addressed	1
anna	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
formality	1
treating	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
a	1
very	1
intimate	1
friend	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
understood	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
knew	1
their	1
real	1
relations	1
and	1
they	1
talked	1
about	1
anna	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
vronsky	1
s	1
estate	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
social	1
experience	1
vronsky	1
was	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
placed	1
laboring	1
under	1
a	1
strange	1
misapprehension	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
understood	1
that	1
society	1
was	1
closed	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
anna	1
but	1
now	1
some	1
vague	1
ideas	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
brain	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
old	1
fashioned	1
days	1
and	1
that	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
modern	1
progress	1
he	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
become	1
by	1
now	1
a	1
partisan	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
progress	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
society	1
had	1
changed	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
received	1
in	1
society	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
foregone	1
conclusion	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
thought	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
received	1
at	1
court	1
but	1
intimate	1
friends	1
can	1
and	1
must	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
light	1
one	1
may	1
sit	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
at	1
a	1
stretch	1
with	1
one	1
s	1
legs	1
crossed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
if	1
one	1
knows	1
that	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
one	1
s	1
changing	1
one	1
s	1
position	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
knows	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
remain	1
sitting	1
so	1
with	1
crossed	1
legs	1
then	1
cramps	1
come	1
on	1
the	1
legs	1
begin	1
to	1
twitch	1
and	1
to	1
strain	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
to	1
which	1
one	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
draw	1
them	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
vronsky	1
was	1
experiencing	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
though	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
shut	1
on	1
them	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
test	1
whether	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
not	1
changed	1
by	1
now	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
receive	1
them	1
but	1
he	1
very	1
quickly	1
perceived	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
open	1
for	1
him	1
personally	1
it	1
was	1
closed	1
for	1
anna	1
just	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
game	1
of	1
cat	1
and	1
mouse	1
the	1
hands	1
raised	1
for	1
him	1
were	1
dropped	1
to	1
bar	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
anna	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
ladies	1
of	1
petersburg	1
society	1
whom	1
vronsky	1
saw	1
was	1
his	1
cousin	1
betsy	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
greeted	1
him	1
joyfully	1
and	1
anna	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
stopping	1
i	1
can	1
fancy	1
after	1
your	1
delightful	1
travels	1

find	1

horrid	1
i	1
can	1
fancy	1
your	1
honeymoon	1
in	1
rome	1
how	1
about	1
the	1
divorce	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
over	1
vronsky	1
noticed	1
that	1
betsy	1
s	1
enthusiasm	1
waned	1
when	1
she	1
learned	1
that	1
no	1
divorce	1
had	1
as	1
yet	1
taken	1
place	1
people	1
will	1
throw	1
stones	1
at	1
me	1
i	1

she	1
said	1
but	1
i	1
shall	1

i	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come	1
you	1
won	1
t	1

here	1
long	1
i	1
suppose	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
certainly	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
anna	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
but	1
her	1
tone	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
in	1
former	1
days	1
she	1
unmistakably	1
prided	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
courage	1
and	1
wished	1
anna	1
to	1
appreciate	1
the	1
fidelity	1
of	1
her	1
friendship	1
she	1
only	1
stayed	1
ten	1
minutes	1
talking	1
of	1
society	1
gossip	1
and	1
on	1
leaving	1
she	1
said	1
you	1
ve	1
never	1
told	1
me	1
when	1
the	1
divorce	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
supposing	1
i	1

see	1
each	1

again	1
from	1
betsy	1
s	1
tone	1
vronsky	1
might	1
have	1
grasped	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
expect	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
he	1
made	1
another	1
effort	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
family	1
his	1
mother	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reckon	1
upon	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
enthusiastic	1
over	1
anna	1
at	1
their	1
first	1
acquaintance	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
mercy	1
on	1
her	1
now	1
for	1
having	1
ruined	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
career	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
hope	1
of	1
varya	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wife	1
he	1
fancied	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
throw	1
stones	1
and	1
would	1
go	1
simply	1
and	1
directly	1
to	1
see	1
anna	1
and	1
would	1
receive	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
vronsky	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
finding	1
her	1
alone	1
expressed	1
his	1
wishes	1
directly	1
you	1
know	1
alexey	1
she	1
said	1
after	1
hearing	1
him	1
how	1
fond	1

vronsky	1
interrupted	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
gloomily	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
in	1
silence	1
understanding	1
that	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
s	1
decision	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
alexey	1

at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
smile	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
still	1
as	1
gloomily	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
sorry	1
in	1
two	1
ways	1
i	1
m	1
sorry	1
too	1
that	1
this	1
means	1
breaking	1
up	1
our	1

if	1
not	1
breaking	1
up	1
at	1

weakening	1
it	1
you	1
will	1
understand	1
that	1
for	1
me	1
too	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
otherwise	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
her	1
vronsky	1
knew	1
that	1
further	1
efforts	1
were	1
useless	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
spend	1
these	1
few	1
days	1
in	1
petersburg	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
town	1
avoiding	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
relation	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
old	1
circle	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
annoyances	1
and	1
humiliations	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
intolerable	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
features	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
in	1
petersburg	1
was	1
that	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
seemed	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
everywhere	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
anything	1
without	1
the	1
conversation	1
turning	1
on	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
anywhere	1
without	1
risk	1
of	1
meeting	1
him	1
so	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
vronsky	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
finger	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
continually	1
as	1
though	1
on	1
purpose	1
grazing	1
his	1
sore	1
finger	1
on	1
everything	1
their	1
stay	1
in	1
petersburg	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
painful	1
to	1
vronsky	1
that	1
he	1
perceived	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
new	1
mood	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
in	1
anna	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
she	1
would	1
seem	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
would	1
become	1
cold	1
irritable	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
she	1
was	1
worrying	1
over	1
something	1
and	1
keeping	1
something	1
back	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
humiliations	1
which	1
poisoned	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
delicate	1
intuition	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
still	1
more	1
unbearable	1
chapter	1
29	1
one	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
objects	1
in	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
russia	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
she	1
left	1
italy	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
agitate	1
her	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
got	1
nearer	1
to	1
petersburg	1
the	1
delight	1
and	1
importance	1
of	1
this	1
meeting	1
grew	1
ever	1
greater	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
put	1
to	1
herself	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
it	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
natural	1
and	1
simple	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
when	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
town	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
on	1
her	1
arrival	1
in	1
petersburg	1
she	1
was	1
suddenly	1
made	1
distinctly	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
present	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
she	1
grasped	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
to	1
arrange	1
this	1
meeting	1
was	1
no	1
easy	1
matter	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
two	1
days	1
in	1
petersburg	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
never	1
left	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
she	1
might	1
meet	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
refused	1
admittance	1
and	1
insulted	1
to	1
write	1
and	1
so	1
enter	1
into	1
relations	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
her	1
miserable	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
doing	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
out	1
walking	1
finding	1
out	1
where	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
this	1
meeting	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
she	1
must	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
so	1
longed	1
to	1
embrace	1
him	1
to	1
kiss	1
him	1
seryozha	1
s	1
old	1
nurse	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
help	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
show	1
her	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
the	1
nurse	1
was	1
not	1
now	1
living	1
in	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
s	1
house	1
in	1
this	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
in	1
efforts	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
nurse	1
two	1
days	1
had	1
slipped	1
by	1
hearing	1
of	1
the	1
close	1
intimacy	1
between	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
anna	1
decided	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
letter	1
which	1
cost	1
her	1
great	1
pains	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
intentionally	1
said	1
that	1
permission	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
generosity	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
letter	1
were	1
shown	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
he	1
would	1
keep	1
up	1
his	1
character	1
of	1
magnanimity	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
her	1
request	1
the	1
commissionaire	1
who	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
back	1
the	1
most	1
cruel	1
and	1
unexpected	1
answer	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
answer	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
so	1
humiliated	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
sending	1
for	1
the	1
commissionaire	1
she	1
heard	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
exact	1
account	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
waited	1
and	1
how	1
afterwards	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
answer	1
anna	1
felt	1
humiliated	1
insulted	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
from	1
her	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
was	1
right	1
her	1
suffering	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
poignant	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
in	1
solitude	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
share	1
it	1
with	1
vronsky	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
to	1
him	1
although	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
primary	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
distress	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
her	1
seeing	1
her	1
son	1
would	1
seem	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
very	1
little	1
consequence	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
understanding	1
all	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
her	1
suffering	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
cool	1
tone	1
at	1
any	1
allusion	1
to	1
it	1
she	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
hate	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
dreaded	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
hid	1
from	1
him	1
everything	1
that	1
related	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
spending	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
at	1
home	1
she	1
considered	1
ways	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
had	1
reached	1
a	1
decision	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
composing	1
this	1
letter	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
handed	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
the	1
countess	1
s	1
silence	1
had	1
subdued	1
and	1
depressed	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
letter	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
read	1
between	1
the	1
lines	1
in	1
it	1
so	1
exasperated	1
her	1
this	1
malice	1
was	1
so	1
revolting	1
beside	1
her	1
passionate	1
legitimate	1
tenderness	1
for	1
her	1
son	1
that	1
she	1
turned	1
against	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
left	1
off	1
blaming	1
herself	1
this	1
coldness	1
this	1
pretense	1
of	1
feeling	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
they	1
must	1
needs	1
insult	1
me	1
and	1
torture	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
it	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
consideration	1
she	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
i	1
am	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
lie	1
anyway	1
and	1
she	1
decided	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
that	1
next	1
day	1
seryozha	1
s	1
birthday	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
house	1
bribe	1
or	1
deceive	1
the	1
servants	1
but	1
at	1
any	1
cost	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
overturn	1
the	1
hideous	1
deception	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
encompassing	1
the	1
unhappy	1
child	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
toy	1
shop	1
bought	1
toys	1
and	1
thought	1
over	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
action	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
at	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
would	1
be	1
certain	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
up	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
money	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
and	1
the	1
footman	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
let	1
her	1
in	1
and	1
not	1
raising	1
her	1
veil	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
seryozha	1
s	1
godfather	1
to	1
congratulate	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
charged	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
toys	1
at	1
his	1
bedside	1
she	1
had	1
prepared	1
everything	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
should	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
often	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
dreamed	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
at	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
anna	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hired	1
sledge	1
and	1
rang	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
entrance	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
home	1
run	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
s	1
wanted	1
some	1
lady	1
said	1
kapitonitch	1
who	1
not	1
yet	1
dressed	1
in	1
his	1
overcoat	1
and	1
galoshes	1
had	1
peeped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
seen	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
veil	1
standing	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
his	1
assistant	1
a	1
lad	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
had	1
no	1
sooner	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
pulling	1
a	1
three	1
rouble	1
note	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
muff	1
put	1
it	1
hurriedly	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
seryozha	1
sergey	1
alexeitch	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
note	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
assistant	1
stopped	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
glass	1
door	1
whom	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
he	1
asked	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
noticing	1
the	1
embarrassment	1
of	1
the	1
unknown	1
lady	1
kapitonitch	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
opened	1
the	1
second	1
door	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
want	1
from	1
prince	1
skorodumov	1
for	1
sergey	1
alexeitch	1
she	1
said	1
his	1
honor	1
s	1
not	1
up	1
yet	1
said	1
the	1
porter	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
attentively	1
anna	1
had	1
not	1
anticipated	1
that	1
the	1
absolutely	1
unchanged	1
hall	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
for	1
nine	1
years	1
would	1
so	1
greatly	1
affect	1
her	1
memories	1
sweet	1
and	1
painful	1
rose	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
forgot	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
here	1
for	1
would	1
you	1
kindly	1
wait	1
said	1
kapitonitch	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
fur	1
cloak	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
cloak	1

of	1
a	1

a	1

and	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
bed	1
was	1
the	1
boy	1
his	1
little	1
body	1
bent	1
forward	1
with	1
his	1
nightshirt	1
unbuttoned	1
he	1
was	1
stretching	1
and	1
still	1
yawning	1
the	1
instant	1
his	1
lips	1
came	1
together	1
they	1
curved	1
into	1
a	1
blissfully	1
sleepy	1
smile	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
smile	1
he	1
slowly	1
and	1
deliciously	1
rolled	1
back	1
again	1
seryozha	1
she	1
whispered	1
going	1
noiselessly	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
parted	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
latter	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
feeling	1
a	1
fresh	1
rush	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
pictured	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
four	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
loved	1
him	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
year	1
old	1
baby	1
more	1
grown	1
and	1
thinner	1
how	1
thin	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
how	1
short	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
what	1
long	1
hands	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
she	1
left	1
him	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
his	1
lips	1
his	1
soft	1
neck	1
and	1
broad	1
little	1
shoulders	1
seryozha	1
she	1
repeated	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
ear	1
he	1
raised	1
himself	1
again	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
turned	1
his	1
tangled	1
head	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
as	1
though	1
looking	1
for	1
something	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
slowly	1
and	1
inquiringly	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
several	1
seconds	1
at	1
his	1
mother	1
standing	1
motionless	1
before	1
him	1
then	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
smiled	1
a	1
blissful	1
smile	1
and	1
shutting	1
his	1
eyes	1
rolled	1
not	1
backwards	1
but	1
towards	1
her	1
into	1
her	1
arms	1
seryozha	1
my	1
darling	1
boy	1

said	1
breathing	1
hard	1
and	1
putting	1
her	1

round	1

plump	1
little	1
body	1
mother	1
he	1
said	1
wriggling	1
about	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
touch	1
her	1
hands	1
with	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
him	1
smiling	1
sleepily	1
still	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
he	1
flung	1
fat	1
little	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
shoulders	1
rolled	1
towards	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
delicious	1
sleepy	1
warmth	1
and	1
fragrance	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
found	1
in	1
children	1
and	1
began	1
rubbing	1
his	1
face	1
against	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1

at	1

grown	1
and	1
changed	1
in	1
her	1
absence	1
she	1
knew	1
and	1

meanwhile	1
vassily	1
lukitch	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
understood	1
who	1
this	1
lady	1
was	1
and	1
had	1
learned	1
from	1
their	1
conversation	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
person	1
than	1
the	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
after	1
her	1
departure	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
whether	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
or	1
not	1
or	1
whether	1
to	1
communicate	1
with	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
reflecting	1
finally	1
that	1
his	1
duty	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
seryozha	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
fixed	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
therefore	1
not	1
his	1
business	1
to	1
consider	1
who	1
was	1
there	1
the	1
mother	1
or	1
anyone	1
else	1
but	1
simply	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
duty	1
he	1
finished	1
dressing	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
opened	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
embraces	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
child	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
voices	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
made	1
him	1
change	1
his	1
mind	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
i	1
ll	1
wait	1
another	1
ten	1
minutes	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
clearing	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
wiping	1
away	1
tears	1
among	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
there	1
was	1
intense	1
excitement	1

her	1
in	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
even	1
now	1
in	1
the	1

and	1
that	1
their	1
master	1
always	1
went	1
in	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
at	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
everyone	1
fully	1
comprehended	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
to	1
meet	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
prevent	1

going	1
down	1
to	1

had	1
done	1
so	1

listening	1
to	1
the	1

the	1

of	1

nurse	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
dread	1
and	1
something	1
like	1
shame	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
strangely	1
unbecoming	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
my	1
sweet	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
said	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
understood	1
darling	1
darling	1
kootik	1
she	1
used	1
the	1
name	1
by	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
called	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
little	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
forget	1
me	1
you	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
more	1
how	1
often	1
afterwards	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
words	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
and	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
but	1
seryozha	1
knew	1
all	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
unhappy	1
and	1
loved	1
him	1
he	1
understood	1
even	1
what	1
the	1
nurse	1
had	1
whispered	1
he	1
had	1
caught	1
the	1
words	1
always	1
at	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
could	1
not	1
meet	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
dread	1
and	1
shame	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
fault	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
ashamed	1
of	1
something	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
question	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
set	1
at	1
rest	1
this	1
doubt	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
miserable	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
silently	1
he	1
pressed	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
whispered	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
yet	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
come	1
just	1
yet	1
the	1
mother	1
held	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
frightened	1
face	1
she	1
read	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
asking	1
her	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
his	1
father	1

he	1
cried	1
in	1
despair	1
through	1
his	1
tears	1
and	1
clutching	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders	1
he	1
began	1
squeezing	1
her	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
force	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
arms	1
trembling	1
with	1
the	1
strain	1

little	1

and	1
she	1
cried	1
as	1
weakly	1
and	1
childishly	1
as	1
he	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
vassily	1

came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
steps	1
and	1
the	1
nurse	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
whisper	1
said	1
he	1
s	1
coming	1
and	1
gave	1
anna	1
her	1
hat	1
seryozha	1
sank	1
onto	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
sobbed	1
hiding	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
anna	1
removed	1
his	1
hands	1
once	1
more	1
kissed	1
his	1
wet	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
walked	1
in	1
meeting	1
her	1
seeing	1
her	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
although	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
better	1
and	1
kinder	1
than	1
she	1
in	1
the	1
rapid	1
glance	1
she	1
flung	1
at	1
him	1
taking	1
in	1
his	1
whole	1
figure	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
details	1
feelings	1
of	1
repulsion	1
and	1
hatred	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
jealousy	1
over	1
her	1
son	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
swift	1
gesture	1
she	1
put	1
down	1
her	1
veil	1
and	1
quickening	1
her	1
pace	1
almost	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
undo	1
and	1
so	1
carried	1
back	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
parcel	1
of	1
toys	1
she	1
had	1
chosen	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
a	1
toy	1
shop	1
with	1
such	1
love	1
and	1
sorrow	1
chapter	1

as	1
intensely	1
as	1
anna	1
had	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
preparing	1
herself	1
for	1
it	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
expected	1
that	1
seeing	1
him	1
would	1
affect	1
her	1
so	1
deeply	1
on	1
getting	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
lonely	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
hotel	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
understand	1
why	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
again	1
alone	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
hat	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
chair	1
by	1
the	1
hearth	1
fixing	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
a	1
bronze	1
clock	1
standing	1
on	1
a	1
table	1
between	1
the	1
windows	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
the	1
french	1
maid	1
brought	1
from	1
abroad	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
suggest	1
she	1
should	1
dress	1
she	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
wonderingly	1
and	1
said	1
presently	1
a	1
footman	1
offered	1
her	1
coffee	1
later	1
on	1
she	1
said	1
the	1
italian	1
nurse	1
after	1
having	1
taken	1
the	1
baby	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
best	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
anna	1
the	1
plump	1
well	1
fed	1
little	1
baby	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
mother	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
fat	1
little	1
hands	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
her	1
toothless	1
mouth	1
began	1
like	1
a	1
fish	1
with	1
a	1
float	1
bobbing	1
her	1
fingers	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
starched	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
embroidered	1
skirt	1
making	1
them	1
rustle	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
smile	1
not	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
baby	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
hold	1
out	1
a	1
finger	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
clutch	1
crowing	1
and	1
prancing	1
all	1
over	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
offer	1
her	1
a	1
lip	1
which	1
she	1
sucked	1
into	1
her	1
little	1
mouth	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
kiss	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
anna	1
did	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
dance	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
fresh	1
little	1
cheek	1
and	1
bare	1
little	1
elbows	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
child	1
it	1
was	1
plainer	1
than	1
ever	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
feeling	1
she	1
had	1
for	1
her	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
love	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
what	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
seryozha	1
everything	1
in	1
this	1
baby	1
was	1
charming	1
but	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
all	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
deep	1
to	1
her	1
heart	1
on	1
her	1
first	1
child	1
though	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
an	1
unloved	1
father	1
had	1
been	1
concentrated	1
all	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
had	1
never	1
found	1
satisfaction	1
her	1
baby	1
girl	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
painful	1
circumstances	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
thought	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
concentrated	1
on	1
her	1
first	1
child	1
besides	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
everything	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
while	1
seryozha	1
was	1
by	1
now	1
almost	1
a	1
personality	1
and	1
a	1
personality	1
dearly	1
loved	1
in	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
conflict	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
feeling	1
he	1
understood	1
her	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
he	1
judged	1
her	1
she	1
thought	1
recalling	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
forever	1
not	1
physically	1
only	1
but	1
spiritually	1
divided	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
set	1
this	1
right	1
she	1
gave	1
the	1
baby	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
nurse	1
let	1
her	1
go	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
locket	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
seryozha	1
s	1
portrait	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
as	1
the	1
girl	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
hat	1
took	1
up	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
an	1
album	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
photographs	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
at	1
different	1
ages	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
compare	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
taking	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
album	1
she	1
took	1
them	1
all	1
out	1
except	1
one	1
the	1
latest	1
and	1
best	1
photograph	1
in	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
smock	1
sitting	1
astride	1
a	1
chair	1
with	1
frowning	1
eyes	1
and	1
smiling	1
lips	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
best	1
most	1
characteristic	1
expression	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
supple	1
hands	1
her	1
white	1
delicate	1
fingers	1
that	1
moved	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
intensity	1
today	1
she	1
pulled	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
photograph	1
but	1
the	1
photograph	1
had	1
caught	1
somewhere	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
it	1
out	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
paper	1
knife	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
so	1
pulling	1
out	1
the	1
photograph	1
that	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
photograph	1
of	1
vronsky	1
taken	1
at	1
rome	1
in	1
a	1
round	1
hat	1
and	1
with	1
long	1
hair	1
she	1
used	1
it	1
to	1
push	1
out	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
photograph	1
oh	1
here	1
is	1
he	1
she	1
said	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
vronsky	1
and	1
she	1
suddenly	1
recalled	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
present	1
misery	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
but	1
now	1
coming	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
that	1
manly	1
noble	1
face	1
so	1
familiar	1
and	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
sudden	1
rush	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
leaves	1
me	1
alone	1
in	1
my	1
misery	1
she	1
thought	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
reproach	1
forgetting	1
she	1
had	1
herself	1
kept	1
from	1
him	1
everything	1
concerning	1
her	1
son	1
she	1
sent	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
immediately	1
with	1
a	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
she	1
awaited	1
him	1
rehearsing	1
to	1
herself	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
him	1
all	1
and	1
the	1
expressions	1
of	1
love	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
console	1
her	1
the	1
messenger	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
answer	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
visitor	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
immediately	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
bring	1
with	1
him	1
prince	1
yashvin	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
in	1
petersburg	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
coming	1
alone	1
and	1
since	1
dinner	1
yesterday	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
seen	1
me	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
coming	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
tell	1
him	1
everything	1
but	1
coming	1
with	1
yashvin	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
strange	1
idea	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
what	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
going	1
over	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
in	1
everything	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
this	1
terrible	1
idea	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
dined	1
at	1
home	1
yesterday	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
insisted	1
on	1
their	1
taking	1
separate	1
sets	1
of	1
rooms	1
in	1
petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
coming	1
to	1
her	1
alone	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
but	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
so	1
i	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
if	1
i	1
knew	1
it	1
then	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
i	1
should	1
do	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
picture	1
to	1
herself	1
the	1
position	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
convinced	1
of	1
his	1
not	1
caring	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
she	1
felt	1
close	1
upon	1
despair	1
and	1
consequently	1
she	1
felt	1
exceptionally	1
alert	1
she	1
rang	1
for	1
her	1
maid	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
dressing	1
room	1
as	1
she	1
dressed	1
she	1
took	1
more	1
care	1
over	1
her	1
appearance	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
those	1
days	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
again	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
dressed	1
and	1
arranged	1
her	1
hair	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
most	1
becoming	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
bell	1
ring	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
he	1
but	1
yashvin	1
who	1
met	1
her	1
eyes	1
vronsky	1
was	1
looking	1
through	1
the	1
photographs	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
haste	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
we	1
have	1
met	1
already	1
she	1
said	1
putting	1
her	1
little	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
huge	1
hand	1
of	1
yashvin	1
whose	1
bashfulness	1
was	1
so	1
queerly	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
immense	1
frame	1
and	1
coarse	1
face	1
we	1
met	1
last	1
year	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
movement	1
snatching	1
from	1
vronsky	1
the	1
photographs	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
glancing	1
significantly	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
flashing	1
eyes	1
were	1
the	1
races	1
good	1
this	1
year	1
instead	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
races	1
in	1
the	1
corso	1
in	1
rome	1
but	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
life	1
abroad	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
cordial	1
smile	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
tastes	1
though	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
so	1
little	1
of	1
you	1
i	1
m	1
awfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
that	1
for	1
my	1
tastes	1
are	1
mostly	1
bad	1
said	1
yashvin	1
gnawing	1
at	1
his	1
left	1
mustache	1
having	1
talked	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
vronsky	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
clock	1
yashvin	1
asked	1
her	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
staying	1
much	1
longer	1
in	1
petersburg	1
and	1
unbending	1
his	1
huge	1
figure	1
reached	1
after	1
his	1
cap	1
not	1
long	1
i	1
think	1
she	1
said	1
hesitatingly	1
glancing	1
at	1
vronsky	1
so	1
then	1
we	1
shan	1
t	1
meet	1
again	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
anna	1
resolutely	1
angry	1
it	1
seemed	1
with	1
herself	1
for	1
her	1
embarrassment	1
but	1
flushing	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
she	1
defined	1
her	1
position	1
before	1
a	1
fresh	1
person	1
the	1
dinner	1
here	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
him	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
his	1

friends	1
in	1

he	1
does	1
for	1
you	1
delighted	1
said	1
yashvin	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
from	1
which	1
vronsky	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
liked	1
anna	1
very	1
much	1
yashvin	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
vronsky	1
stayed	1
behind	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
too	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
m	1
late	1
already	1
he	1
answered	1
run	1
along	1
i	1
ll	1
catch	1
you	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
yashvin	1
she	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
without	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
while	1
she	1
ransacked	1
her	1
mind	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
would	1
keep	1
him	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
broad	1
hand	1
she	1
pressed	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
oh	1
was	1
it	1
right	1
my	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
dinner	1
you	1
did	1
quite	1
right	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
serene	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
his	1
even	1
teeth	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
alexey	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
changed	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
both	1
of	1
hers	1
alexey	1
i	1
am	1
miserable	1
here	1
when	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
away	1
soon	1

you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
how	1
disagreeable	1
our	1
way	1
of	1
living	1
here	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
too	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
away	1
his	1
hand	1
well	1
go	1
go	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
offense	1
and	1
she	1
walked	1
quickly	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
chapter	1

when	1
vronsky	1
returned	1
home	1
anna	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
home	1
soon	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
some	1
lady	1
so	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
without	1
leaving	1
word	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
about	1
somewhere	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
this	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
strange	1
look	1
of	1
excitement	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
hostile	1
tone	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
before	1
yashvin	1
almost	1
snatched	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
photographs	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
made	1
him	1
serious	1
he	1
decided	1
he	1
absolutely	1
must	1
speak	1
openly	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
waited	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room	1
but	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
alone	1
but	1
brought	1
with	1
her	1
her	1
old	1
unmarried	1

this	1
was	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
anna	1
had	1
gone	1

worried	1
and	1
inquiring	1
expression	1
and	1
began	1
a	1
lively	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
morning	1
s	1
shopping	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
working	1
within	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
flashing	1
eyes	1
when	1
they	1
rested	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
on	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
intense	1
concentration	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
words	1
and	1
movements	1
there	1
was	1
that	1
nervous	1
rapidity	1
and	1
grace	1
which	1
during	1
the	1
early	1
period	1
of	1
their	1
intimacy	1
had	1
so	1
fascinated	1
him	1
but	1
which	1
now	1
so	1
disturbed	1
and	1
alarmed	1
him	1
the	1
dinner	1
was	1
laid	1
for	1
four	1
all	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
and	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
dining	1
room	1
when	1
tushkevitch	1
made	1
his	1
appearance	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
princess	1

princess	1
betsy	1
begged	1
her	1
to	1
excuse	1
her	1
not	1
having	1
come	1

say	1
good	1

she	1
had	1
been	1
indisposed	1

begged	1
anna	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
between	1
half	1
past	1
six	1
and	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
vronsky	1
glanced	1
at	1
anna	1
at	1
the	1
precise	1
limit	1
of	1
time	1
so	1
suggestive	1
of	1
steps	1
having	1
been	1
taken	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
meet	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
anna	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
it	1
very	1
sorry	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
come	1
just	1
between	1
half	1
past	1
six	1
and	1
nine	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
the	1
princess	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
sorry	1
and	1
so	1
am	1
i	1
you	1
re	1
going	1
no	1

to	1
hear	1
patti	1
said	1
tushkevitch	1
patti	1
you	1
suggest	1
the	1
idea	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
would	1
go	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
box	1
i	1
can	1
get	1
one	1
tushkevitch	1
offered	1
his	1
services	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
anna	1
but	1
won	1
t	1
you	1
dine	1
with	1
us	1
vronsky	1
gave	1
a	1
hardly	1
perceptible	1
shrug	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
complete	1
loss	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
anna	1
was	1
about	1
what	1
had	1
she	1
brought	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
oblonskaya	1
home	1
for	1
what	1
had	1
she	1
made	1
tushkevitch	1
stay	1
to	1
dinner	1
for	1
and	1
most	1
amazing	1
of	1
all	1
why	1
was	1
she	1
sending	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
box	1
could	1
she	1
possibly	1
think	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
patti	1
s	1
benefit	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
would	1
be	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
serious	1
eyes	1
but	1
she	1
responded	1
with	1
that	1
defiant	1
half	1
mirthful	1
half	1
desperate	1
look	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
comprehend	1
at	1
dinner	1
anna	1
was	1
in	1
aggressively	1
high	1
spirits	1
she	1
almost	1
flirted	1
both	1
with	1
tushkevitch	1
and	1
with	1
yashvin	1
when	1
they	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
dinner	1
and	1
tushkevitch	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
box	1
at	1
the	1
opera	1
yashvin	1
went	1
to	1
smoke	1
and	1
vronsky	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
rooms	1
after	1
sitting	1
there	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
anna	1
was	1
already	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
necked	1
gown	1
of	1
light	1
silk	1
and	1
velvet	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
paris	1
and	1
with	1
costly	1
white	1
lace	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
framing	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
particularly	1
becoming	1
showing	1
up	1
her	1
dazzling	1
beauty	1
are	1
you	1
really	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
theater	1
he	1
said	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
ask	1
with	1
such	1
alarm	1
she	1
said	1
wounded	1
again	1
at	1
his	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
i	1
go	1
she	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
motive	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
oh	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
reason	1
whatever	1
he	1
said	1
frowning	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
i	1
say	1
she	1
said	1
willfully	1
refusing	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
irony	1
of	1
his	1
tone	1
and	1
quietly	1
turning	1
back	1
her	1
long	1
perfumed	1
glove	1
anna	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
appealing	1
to	1
her	1
exactly	1
as	1
once	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
done	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
asking	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
go	1
why	1
so	1

not	1
going	1
alone	1
princess	1
varvara	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
dress	1
she	1
is	1
going	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
perplexity	1
and	1
despair	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
he	1
began	1
but	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
know	1
she	1
almost	1
shrieked	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
do	1
i	1
regret	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
no	1
no	1
no	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
do	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
for	1
us	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
matters	1
whether	1
we	1
love	1
each	1
other	1
other	1
people	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
consider	1
why	1
are	1
we	1
living	1
here	1
apart	1
and	1
not	1
seeing	1
each	1
other	1
why	1

i	1
go	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
anything	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
russian	1
glancing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
gleam	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
changed	1
to	1
me	1
why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
full	1
dress	1
always	1
so	1
becoming	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
now	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
elegance	1
were	1
just	1
what	1
irritated	1
him	1
my	1
feeling	1
cannot	1
change	1
you	1
know	1
but	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
i	1
entreat	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
in	1
french	1
with	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
tender	1
supplication	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
but	1
with	1
coldness	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
coldness	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
answered	1
with	1
irritation	1
and	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
explain	1
why	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
because	1
it	1
might	1
cause	1
you	1

hesitated	1

here	1
she	1
is	1
chapter	1
33	1
vronsky	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
anger	1
against	1
anna	1
almost	1
a	1
hatred	1
for	1
her	1
willfully	1
refusing	1
to	1
understand	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
this	1
feeling	1
was	1
aggravated	1
by	1
his	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
plainly	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
anger	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
directly	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
in	1
that	1
dress	1
with	1
a	1

only	1
too	1
well	1

equivalent	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
acknowledging	1
your	1
position	1
as	1
a	1
fallen	1
woman	1

is	1
flinging	1
down	1
a	1
challenge	1
to	1
society	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
cutting	1
yourself	1
off	1
from	1
it	1
forever	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
how	1
can	1
she	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
her	1

said	1

himself	1

felt	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
that	1
his	1
respect	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
diminished	1
while	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
was	1
intensified	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
scowling	1
to	1

sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
yashvin	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
long	1

stretched	1
out	1
on	1

vronsky	1
their	1

to	1

under	1

by	1
this	1

that	1
he	1

up	1

and	1
why	1

putting	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair	1
with	1
that	1
gesture	1
he	1
knocked	1
against	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
standing	1
the	1
seltzer	1
water	1
and	1
the	1
decanter	1
of	1
brandy	1
and	1
almost	1
upset	1
it	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
it	1
let	1
it	1
slip	1
and	1
angrily	1
kicked	1
the	1
table	1
over	1
and	1
rang	1
if	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
service	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
valet	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
remember	1
your	1
duties	1
this	1
shouldn	1

here	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
cleared	1
away	1
the	1
valet	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
innocence	1
would	1
have	1
defended	1
himself	1
but	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
master	1
he	1
saw	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
threading	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
dropped	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
carpet	1
and	1
began	1
gathering	1
up	1

out	1
vronsky	1

into	1
the	1
theater	1
at	1
half	1
past	1
eight	1
the	1
performance	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
swing	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
box	1
keeper	1
recognizing	1
vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
helped	1
him	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
called	1
him	1
your	1
excellency	1
and	1
suggested	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
number	1
but	1
should	1
simply	1
call	1
fyodor	1
in	1
the	1
brightly	1
lighted	1
corridor	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
the	1
box	1
opener	1
and	1
two	1
attendants	1
with	1
fur	1
cloaks	1
on	1
their	1
arms	1
listening	1
at	1
the	1
doors	1
through	1
the	1
closed	1
doors	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
discreet	1
staccato	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
the	1
orchestra	1
and	1
a	1
single	1
female	1
voice	1
rendering	1
distinctly	1
a	1
musical	1
phrase	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
box	1
opener	1
slip	1
through	1
and	1
the	1
phrase	1
drawing	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
reached	1
vronsky	1
s	1
hearing	1
clearly	1
but	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
closed	1
again	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
phrase	1
and	1
the	1
cadence	1
of	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
from	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
applause	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
hall	1
brilliantly	1
lighted	1
with	1
chandeliers	1
and	1
gas	1
jets	1
the	1
noise	1
was	1
still	1
going	1
on	1
on	1
the	1
stage	1
the	1
singer	1
bowing	1
and	1
smiling	1
with	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
flashing	1
with	1
diamonds	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
tenor	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
his	1
arm	1
gathering	1
up	1
the	1
bouquets	1
that	1
were	1
flying	1
awkwardly	1
over	1
the	1
footlights	1
then	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
gentleman	1
with	1
glossy	1
pomaded	1
hair	1
parted	1
down	1
the	1
center	1
who	1
was	1
stretching	1
across	1
the	1
footlights	1
holding	1
out	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
public	1
in	1
the	1
stalls	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
boxes	1
was	1
in	1
excitement	1
craning	1
forward	1
shouting	1
and	1
clapping	1
the	1
conductor	1
in	1
his	1
high	1
chair	1
assisted	1
in	1
passing	1
the	1
offering	1
and	1
straightened	1
his	1
white	1
tie	1
vronsky	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
stalls	1
and	1
standing	1
still	1
began	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
that	1
day	1
less	1
than	1
ever	1
was	1
his	1
attention	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
familiar	1
habitual	1
surroundings	1
the	1
stage	1
the	1
noise	1
all	1
the	1
familiar	1
uninteresting	1
particolored	1
herd	1
of	1
spectators	1
in	1
the	1
packed	1
theater	1
there	1
were	1
as	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
ladies	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
with	1
officers	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
boxes	1
the	1
same	1
gaily	1
dressed	1
women	1
god	1
knows	1
who	1
and	1
uniforms	1
and	1
black	1
coats	1
the	1

dirty	1
crowd	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
gallery	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
crowd	1
in	1
the	1
boxes	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
rows	1
were	1
some	1
forty	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
oases	1
vronsky	1
at	1
once	1
directed	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
entered	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
relation	1
the	1
act	1
was	1
over	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
box	1
but	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
of	1
stalls	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
footlights	1
with	1
serpuhovskoy	1
who	1
standing	1
with	1
one	1
knee	1
raised	1
and	1
his	1
heel	1
on	1
the	1
footlights	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
and	1
beckoned	1
to	1
him	1
smiling	1
vronsky	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
anna	1
he	1
purposely	1
avoided	1
looking	1
in	1
her	1
direction	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
people	1
s	1
eyes	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
discreetly	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
seeking	1
her	1
expecting	1
the	1
worst	1
his	1
eyes	1
sought	1
for	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
to	1
his	1
relief	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
theater	1
that	1
evening	1
how	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
man	1
there	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
you	1
serpuhovskoy	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
diplomat	1
an	1
artist	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
one	1
would	1
say	1
yes	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
going	1
back	1
home	1
when	1
i	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
black	1
coat	1
answered	1
vronsky	1
smiling	1
and	1
slowly	1
taking	1
out	1
his	1
opera	1
glass	1
well	1
i	1
ll	1

you	1
there	1
when	1
i	1

from	1

put	1
on	1
this	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
epaulets	1
i	1
regret	1
my	1
freedom	1
serpuhovskoy	1
had	1
long	1
given	1
up	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
vronsky	1
s	1
career	1
but	1
he	1
liked	1
him	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
particularly	1
cordial	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
act	1
vronsky	1
listening	1
with	1
one	1
ear	1
moved	1
his	1
opera	1
glass	1
from	1
the	1
stalls	1
and	1
scanned	1
the	1
boxes	1
near	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
turban	1
and	1
a	1
bald	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
wave	1
angrily	1
in	1
the	1
moving	1
opera	1
glass	1
vronsky	1
suddenly	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
head	1
proud	1
strikingly	1
beautiful	1
and	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
frame	1
of	1
lace	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
box	1
twenty	1
paces	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
slightly	1
turning	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
yashvin	1
the	1
setting	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
her	1
handsome	1
broad	1
shoulders	1
and	1
the	1
restrained	1
excitement	1
and	1
brilliance	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
face	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
moscow	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
utterly	1
different	1
towards	1
her	1
beauty	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
element	1
of	1
mystery	1
and	1
so	1
her	1
beauty	1
though	1
it	1
attracted	1
him	1
even	1
more	1
intensely	1
than	1
before	1
gave	1
him	1
now	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
injury	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
looking	1
in	1
his	1
direction	1
but	1
vronsky	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
already	1
when	1
vronsky	1
turned	1
the	1
opera	1
glass	1
again	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
princess	1
varvara	1
was	1
particularly	1
red	1
and	1
kept	1
laughing	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
box	1
anna	1
folding	1
her	1
fan	1
and	1
tapping	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
red	1
velvet	1
was	1
gazing	1
away	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
obviously	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
box	1
yashvin	1
s	1
face	1
wore	1
the	1
expression	1
which	1
was	1
common	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
losing	1
at	1
cards	1
scowling	1
he	1
sucked	1
the	1
left	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
mustache	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
into	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
cast	1
sidelong	1
glances	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
box	1
in	1
that	1
box	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
were	1
the	1
kartasovs	1
vronsky	1
knew	1
them	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
anna	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
them	1
madame	1
kartasova	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
woman	1
was	1
standing	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
box	1
and	1
her	1
back	1
turned	1
upon	1
anna	1
she	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
a	1
mantle	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
holding	1
for	1
her	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
angry	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
excitedly	1
kartasov	1
a	1
fat	1
bald	1
man	1
was	1
continually	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
anna	1
while	1
he	1
attempted	1
to	1
soothe	1
his	1
wife	1
when	1
the	1
wife	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
the	1
husband	1
lingered	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
anna	1
s	1
eye	1
obviously	1
anxious	1
to	1
bow	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
anna	1
with	1
unmistakable	1
intention	1
avoided	1
noticing	1

could	1
not	1
understand	1
exactly	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1

anna	1
but	1
he	1

this	1
both	1
from	1

of	1
all	1
from	1

taxing	1
every	1

taken	1
up	1

in	1

composure	1
she	1
was	1
completely	1
successful	1
anyone	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
circle	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
utterances	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
expressive	1
of	1
commiseration	1
indignation	1
and	1
amazement	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
show	1
herself	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
show	1
herself	1
so	1
conspicuously	1
with	1
her	1
lace	1
and	1
her	1
beauty	1
would	1
have	1
admired	1
the	1
serenity	1
and	1
loveliness	1
of	1
this	1
woman	1
without	1
a	1
suspicion	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
undergoing	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
stocks	1
knowing	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
but	1
not	1
knowing	1
precisely	1
what	1
vronsky	1
felt	1
a	1
thrill	1
of	1
agonizing	1
anxiety	1
and	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
something	1

went	1
towards	1
his	1

purposely	1
choosing	1
the	1
way	1
round	1
furthest	1
from	1

a	1

at	1

up	1

at	1

anna	1
he	1
said	1
you	1

getting	1
up	1

never	1

it	1
she	1
said	1

me	1
a	1

it	1
why	1

she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
terror	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
angry	1
notwithstanding	1
he	1
assured	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
means	1
of	1
soothing	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reproach	1
her	1
in	1
words	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
reproached	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
asseverations	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
vulgar	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
utter	1
them	1
she	1
drank	1
in	1
eagerly	1
and	1
gradually	1
became	1
calmer	1

next	1
day	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
greatly	1
approved	1
of	1
the	1
arrangement	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
sorry	1
his	1
official	1
duties	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
spending	1
the	1
summer	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
remaining	1
in	1
moscow	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
besides	1
the	1
oblonskys	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
governess	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
too	1
came	1
to	1
stay	1
that	1
summer	1
with	1
the	1
levins	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
watch	1
over	1
her	1
inexperienced	1
daughter	1
in	1
her	1
interesting	1
condition	1
moreover	1
varenka	1

kept	1
her	1
promise	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
kitty	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
married	1
and	1
stayed	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
all	1
of	1
these	1
were	1
friends	1
or	1
relations	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
wife	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
liked	1
them	1
all	1
he	1
rather	1
regretted	1
his	1
own	1
levin	1
world	1
and	1
ways	1
which	1
was	1
smothered	1
by	1
this	1
influx	1
of	1
the	1
shtcherbatsky	1
element	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
relations	1
there	1
stayed	1
with	1
him	1
only	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
but	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
koznishev	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
levin	1
stamp	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
levin	1
spirit	1
was	1
utterly	1
obliterated	1
in	1
the	1
levins	1
house	1
so	1
long	1
deserted	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
that	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
were	1
occupied	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
day	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
table	1
counted	1
them	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
grandson	1
or	1
granddaughter	1
at	1
a	1
separate	1
table	1
and	1
kitty	1
with	1
her	1
careful	1
housekeeping	1
had	1
no	1
little	1
trouble	1
to	1
get	1
all	1
the	1
chickens	1
turkeys	1
and	1
geese	1
of	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
were	1
needed	1
to	1
satisfy	1
the	1
summer	1
appetites	1
of	1
the	1
visitors	1
and	1
children	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
dinner	1
dolly	1
s	1
children	1
with	1
their	1
governess	1
and	1
varenka	1
were	1
making	1
plans	1
for	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
for	1

sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
who	1
was	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
party	1
for	1
his	1
intellect	1
and	1
learning	1
with	1
a	1
respect	1
that	1
almost	1
amounted	1
to	1
awe	1
surprised	1
everyone	1
by	1
joining	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
about	1
mushrooms	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
picking	1

said	1
looking	1
at	1
varenka	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
occupation	1
oh	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
answered	1
varenka	1
coloring	1
a	1
little	1
kitty	1
exchanged	1
meaningful	1
glances	1
with	1
dolly	1
the	1
proposal	1
of	1
the	1
learned	1
and	1
intellectual	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
to	1
go	1
looking	1
for	1
mushrooms	1
with	1
varenka	1
confirmed	1
certain	1
theories	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
with	1
which	1
her	1
mind	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
busy	1
of	1
late	1
she	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
address	1
some	1
remark	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
look	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
noticed	1
after	1
dinner	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee	1
at	1
the	1
drawing	1

and	1
while	1
he	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
conversation	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
watched	1

through	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
would	1
start	1
on	1
the	1

picking	1
expedition	1
levin	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
near	1
his	1
brother	1
kitty	1
stood	1
beside	1
her	1
husband	1
evidently	1
awaiting	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
interest	1
for	1

since	1
your	1

for	1
the	1

ivanovitch	1
smiling	1
to	1
kitty	1

obviously	1
little	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
remained	1
true	1
to	1
your	1
passion	1
for	1
defending	1
the	1
most	1
paradoxical	1
theories	1
katya	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
good	1
for	1

him	1
boldly	1

up	1

sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes	1
so	1
like	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
fine	1
eyes	1
she	1
handed	1
him	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
for	1
him	1
softening	1
her	1
freedom	1
by	1
a	1
shy	1
and	1
friendly	1
smile	1

from	1

smile	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
do	1
so	1
varenka	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
yellow	1

into	1
their	1

his	1

and	1
how	1

my	1

said	1
kitty	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
rose	1
she	1
spoke	1
so	1
that	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
could	1
hear	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
meant	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
how	1
good	1
looking	1
she	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
refined	1
beauty	1

your	1
condition	1
kitty	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
hurriedly	1
coming	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
shout	1
like	1
that	1
varenka	1
hearing	1
kitty	1
s	1
voice	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
reprimand	1
went	1
with	1
light	1
rapid	1
steps	1
up	1
to	1
kitty	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
her	1
movement	1
her	1
flushed	1
and	1
eager	1
face	1
everything	1
betrayed	1
that	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
her	1
kitty	1
knew	1
what	1
this	1
was	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
her	1
intently	1
she	1
called	1
varenka	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
merely	1
in	1
order	1
mentally	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
blessing	1
for	1
the	1
important	1
event	1
which	1
as	1
kitty	1
fancied	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
day	1
after	1
dinner	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
varenka	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
if	1
a	1
certain	1
something	1
were	1
to	1
happen	1
she	1
whispered	1
as	1
she	1
kissed	1
her	1
and	1
are	1
you	1
coming	1
with	1
us	1
varenka	1
said	1
to	1
levin	1
in	1
confusion	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
i	1
am	1
coming	1
but	1
only	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
threshing	1
floor	1
and	1
there	1
i	1
shall	1
stop	1
why	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
there	1
said	1
kitty	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
wagons	1
and	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
invoice	1
said	1
levin	1
and	1
where	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
chapter	1
2	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
were	1
assembled	1
all	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
they	1
always	1
liked	1
sitting	1
there	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
had	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
there	1
too	1
besides	1
the	1
sewing	1
and	1
knitting	1
of	1
baby	1
clothes	1
with	1
which	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
busy	1
that	1
afternoon	1
jam	1
was	1
being	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
by	1
a	1
method	1
new	1
to	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
without	1
the	1
addition	1
of	1
water	1
kitty	1
had	1
introduced	1
this	1
new	1
method	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
use	1
in	1
her	1
home	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
jam	1
making	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
intrusted	1
considering	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
levin	1
household	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
amiss	1
had	1
nevertheless	1
put	1
water	1
with	1
the	1
strawberries	1
maintaining	1
that	1
the	1
jam	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
without	1
it	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
making	1
jam	1
before	1
everyone	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
proved	1
to	1
her	1
conclusively	1
that	1
jam	1
could	1
be	1
very	1
well	1
made	1
without	1
water	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
her	1
face	1
heated	1
and	1
angry	1
her	1
hair	1
untidy	1
and	1
her	1
thin	1
arms	1
bare	1
to	1
the	1
elbows	1
was	1
turning	1
the	1
preserving	1
pan	1
over	1
the	1
charcoal	1
stove	1
looking	1
darkly	1
at	1
the	1
raspberries	1
and	1
devoutly	1
hoping	1
they	1
would	1
stick	1
and	1
not	1
cook	1
properly	1
the	1
princess	1
conscious	1
that	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
s	1
wrath	1
must	1
be	1
chiefly	1
directed	1
against	1
her	1
as	1
the	1
person	1
responsible	1
for	1
the	1
raspberry	1
jam	1
making	1
tried	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
absorbed	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
and	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
jam	1
talked	1
of	1
other	1
matters	1
but	1
cast	1
stealthy	1
glances	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
stove	1
i	1
always	1
buy	1
my	1
maids	1
dresses	1
myself	1
of	1
some	1
cheap	1
material	1
the	1
princess	1

the	1
previous	1
conversation	1
isn	1

to	1
skim	1
it	1
my	1
dear	1
she	1
added	1
addressing	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
there	1

not	1
the	1

for	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
and	1
it	1

for	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
stopping	1
kitty	1
i	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
said	1
dolly	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
she	1
carefully	1
passed	1
the	1
spoon	1
over	1
the	1
frothing	1
sugar	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
clinging	1
jam	1
from	1
the	1
spoon	1
by	1
knocking	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
plate	1
that	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
yellow	1
red	1
scum	1
and	1
blood	1
colored	1
syrup	1
how	1
they	1
ll	1
enjoy	1
this	1
at	1
tea	1
time	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
children	1
remembering	1
how	1
she	1
herself	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
had	1
wondered	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
eat	1
what	1
was	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
scum	1
of	1
the	1
jam	1
stiva	1
says	1
it	1
s	1
much	1
better	1
to	1
give	1
money	1
dolly	1
took	1
up	1
meanwhile	1
the	1
weighty	1
subject	1
under	1
discussion	1
what	1
presents	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
servants	1
but	1
money	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
kitty	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
they	1
appreciate	1
a	1
present	1
well	1
last	1
year	1
for	1
instance	1
i	1
bought	1
our	1
matrona	1
semyenovna	1

was	1
wearing	1
it	1
on	1
your	1
nameday	1
a	1
charming	1
pattern	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
refined	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
liked	1
it	1
myself	1
if	1
she	1
hadn	1
t	1
had	1
it	1
something	1
like	1
varenka	1

so	1
pretty	1
and	1
inexpensive	1
well	1

dolly	1
dropping	1
the	1
syrup	1
from	1
the	1

angrily	1

kitty	1
said	1
suddenly	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
sparrow	1
that	1
had	1
settled	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
and	1
was	1
pecking	1
at	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
a	1
raspberry	1

kitty	1
speaking	1
in	1
french	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
so	1
that	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
should	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
you	1
know	1
mamma	1
i	1
somehow	1
expect	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
settled	1
today	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
i	1
mean	1
how	1
splendid	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
but	1
what	1
a	1
famous	1
matchmaker	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
dolly	1
how	1
carefully	1
and	1
cleverly	1

throws	1

together	1
no	1

why	1

at	1
any	1
time	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
anyone	1
in	1
russia	1
now	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
quite	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
still	1
i	1
know	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
girls	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
marry	1
him	1
even	1
now	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
girl	1
but	1
he	1
might	1
oh	1
no	1
mamma	1
do	1
understand	1
why	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
too	1
nothing	1
better	1
could	1
be	1
imagined	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
she	1
s	1
charming	1
said	1
kitty	1
crooking	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
fingers	1
he	1
thinks	1
her	1
very	1
attractive	1
that	1
s	1
certain	1
assented	1
dolly	1
then	1
he	1
occupies	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
either	1
fortune	1
or	1
position	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1

he	1
needs	1

a	1
good	1
sweet	1
wife	1
a	1
restful	1
one	1
well	1
with	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
restful	1
dolly	1
assented	1
thirdly	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
is	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
splendid	1
i	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
seeing	1
them	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
everything	1
settled	1
i	1
shall	1
see	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
their	1
eyes	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
delighted	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
dolly	1
but	1
don	1
t	1
excite	1
yourself	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
thing	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
excited	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
oh	1
i	1
m	1

i	1
fancy	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
today	1
ah	1
that	1
s	1
so	1
strange	1
how	1
and	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
makes	1
an	1
offer	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
barrier	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
s	1
broken	1
down	1
said	1
dolly	1
smiling	1
pensively	1
and	1
recalling	1
her	1
past	1
with	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
mamma	1
how	1
did	1
papa	1
make	1
you	1
an	1
offer	1
kitty	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
simple	1
answered	1
the	1
princess	1
but	1
her	1
face	1
beamed	1
all	1
over	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
oh	1
but	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
loved	1
him	1
anyway	1
before	1
you	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
speak	1
kitty	1
felt	1
a	1
peculiar	1
pleasure	1
in	1
being	1
able	1
now	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
on	1
equal	1
terms	1
about	1
those	1
questions	1
of	1
such	1
paramount	1
interest	1
in	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
life	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
did	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
but	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
settled	1
between	1
you	1
mamma	1
you	1
imagine	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
invented	1
something	1
quite	1
new	1
it	1
s	1
always	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
by	1
the	1
eyes	1
by	1
smiles	1
how	1
nicely	1
you	1
said	1
that	1
mamma	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
by	1
the	1
eyes	1
by	1
smiles	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
done	1
dolly	1
assented	1
but	1
what	1
words	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
what	1
did	1
kostya	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
wrote	1
it	1
in	1
chalk	1
it	1
was	1
wonderful	1
how	1
long	1
ago	1
it	1
seems	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
women	1
all	1
fell	1
to	1
musing	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
kitty	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
silence	1
she	1
remembered	1
all	1
that	1
last	1
winter	1
before	1
her	1
marriage	1
and	1
her	1
passion	1
for	1
vronsky	1

i	1
m	1
sorry	1
i	1
ve	1
broken	1
in	1
on	1

he	1
said	1
looking	1
round	1
on	1
everyone	1
discontentedly	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
of	1
something	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
before	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sharing	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
vexation	1
at	1
their	1
making	1
jam	1
without	1
water	1
and	1
altogether	1
at	1
the	1
outside	1
shtcherbatsky	1
element	1
he	1
smiled	1
however	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
kitty	1
well	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
everyone	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
now	1
oh	1

smiling	1
and	1
how	1

in	1
the	1
wagonette	1
her	1
mother	1
said	1
reproachfully	1
yes	1
at	1
a	1
walking	1
pace	1
princess	1
levin	1
never	1
called	1
the	1
princess	1
maman	1
as	1
men	1
often	1
do	1
call	1
their	1
mothers	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
disliked	1
his	1
not	1
doing	1
so	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
liked	1
and	1
respected	1
the	1
princess	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
call	1
her	1
so	1
without	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
profaning	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
his	1
dead	1
mother	1
come	1
with	1

got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1

and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
well	1

at	1
once	1
divining	1
her	1

chapter	1
3	1
kitty	1
was	1
particularly	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
noticed	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
mortification	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
always	1
so	1
quick	1
to	1
reflect	1
every	1
feeling	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
onto	1
the	1
terrace	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
and	1
had	1
got	1
no	1
answer	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
off	1
on	1
foot	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
onto	1
the	1
beaten	1
dusty	1
road	1
marked	1
with	1
rusty	1
wheels	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
grains	1
of	1
corn	1
she	1
clung	1
faster	1
to	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
pressed	1
it	1
closer	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
the	1
momentary	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
and	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
approaching	1
motherhood	1
was	1
never	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
absent	1
from	1
his	1
mind	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
delicious	1
bliss	1
quite	1
pure	1
from	1
all	1
alloy	1
of	1
sense	1
in	1
the	1
being	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
speech	1
yet	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
which	1
like	1
her	1
eyes	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
child	1
in	1
her	1
voice	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
that	1
softness	1
and	1
gravity	1
which	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
people	1
continually	1
concentrated	1
on	1
some	1
cherished	1
pursuit	1
so	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
tired	1
lean	1
more	1
on	1
me	1
said	1
he	1
no	1
i	1
m	1
so	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
alone	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
own	1
though	1
i	1
m	1
happy	1
with	1
them	1
i	1
do	1
regret	1
our	1
winter	1
evenings	1
alone	1
that	1
was	1
good	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
even	1
better	1
both	1
are	1
better	1
he	1
said	1
squeezing	1
her	1
hand	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
when	1
you	1
came	1
in	1
about	1
jam	1
oh	1
yes	1
about	1
jam	1
too	1
but	1
afterwards	1
about	1
how	1
men	1
make	1
offers	1
ah	1
said	1
levin	1
listening	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
paying	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
which	1
passed	1
now	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
avoiding	1
places	1
where	1
she	1
might	1
make	1
a	1
false	1
step	1
and	1
about	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
varenka	1
you	1
ve	1
noticed	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
anxious	1
for	1
it	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
she	1
peeped	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
levin	1
answered	1
smiling	1
sergey	1
seems	1
very	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
you	1
know	1
yes	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
girl	1
who	1
died	1
that	1
was	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
child	1
i	1
know	1
about	1
it	1
from	1
hearsay	1
and	1
tradition	1
i	1
remember	1
him	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
wonderfully	1
sweet	1
but	1
i	1
ve	1
watched	1
him	1
since	1
with	1
women	1
he	1
is	1
friendly	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
likes	1
but	1
one	1
feels	1
that	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
re	1
simply	1
people	1
not	1
women	1
yes	1
but	1
now	1
with	1
varenka	1
i	1
fancy	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
perhaps	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
know	1
him	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
peculiar	1
wonderful	1
person	1
he	1
lives	1
a	1
spiritual	1
life	1
only	1
he	1
s	1
too	1
pure	1
too	1
exalted	1
a	1
nature	1
why	1
would	1
this	1
lower	1
him	1
then	1
no	1
but	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
a	1
spiritual	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
reconcile	1
himself	1
with	1
actual	1
fact	1
and	1
varenka	1
is	1
after	1
all	1
fact	1
levin	1
had	1
grown	1
used	1
by	1
now	1
to	1
uttering	1
his	1
thought	1
boldly	1
without	1
taking	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
clothing	1
it	1
in	1
exact	1
language	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
such	1
moments	1
of	1
loving	1
tenderness	1
as	1
now	1
would	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
from	1
a	1
hint	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
understand	1
him	1
yes	1
but	1
there	1
s	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
that	1
actual	1
fact	1
about	1
her	1
as	1
about	1
me	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
cared	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
is	1
altogether	1
spiritual	1
oh	1
no	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
always	1
so	1
glad	1
when	1
my	1
people	1
like	1
you	1
yes	1
he	1
s	1
very	1
nice	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
poor	1
nikolay	1
you	1
really	1
cared	1
for	1
each	1
other	1
levin	1
finished	1
why	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
added	1
i	1
sometimes	1
blame	1
myself	1
for	1
not	1
it	1
ends	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
forgetting	1
ah	1
how	1
terrible	1
and	1
dear	1
he	1
was	1
yes	1
what	1
were	1
we	1
talking	1
about	1
levin	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
said	1
kitty	1
translating	1
into	1
her	1
own	1
language	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
levin	1
said	1
smiling	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
weakness	1
necessary	1
i	1
ve	1
always	1
envied	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
m	1
so	1
happy	1
i	1
still	1
envy	1
him	1
you	1
envy	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
i	1
envy	1
him	1
for	1
being	1
better	1
than	1
i	1
said	1
levin	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
live	1
for	1
himself	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
is	1
subordinated	1
to	1
his	1
duty	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
contented	1
and	1
you	1
kitty	1
asked	1
with	1
an	1
ironical	1
and	1
loving	1
smile	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
explained	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
thought	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
smile	1
but	1
the	1
last	1
link	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
exalting	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
abasing	1
himself	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
sincere	1
kitty	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
insincerity	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
from	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
at	1
being	1
too	1
happy	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
from	1
his	1
unflagging	1
craving	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
she	1
loved	1
it	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
smiled	1
and	1
you	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
she	1
asked	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
her	1
disbelief	1
in	1
his	1
self	1
dissatisfaction	1
delighted	1
him	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
into	1
giving	1
utterance	1
to	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
her	1
disbelief	1
i	1
am	1
happy	1
but	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
myself	1
he	1
said	1
why	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
yourself	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
happy	1
well	1
how	1
shall	1
i	1
say	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
really	1
care	1
for	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
stumble	1
see	1
oh	1
but	1
really	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
skip	1
about	1
like	1
that	1
he	1
cried	1
breaking	1
off	1
to	1
scold	1
her	1
for	1
too	1
agile	1
a	1
movement	1
in	1
stepping	1
over	1
a	1
branch	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
think	1
about	1
myself	1
and	1
compare	1
myself	1
with	1
others	1
especially	1
with	1
my	1
brother	1
i	1
feel	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
poor	1
creature	1
but	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
kitty	1
pursued	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
too	1
work	1
for	1
others	1
what	1
about	1
your	1
co	1
operative	1
settlement	1
and	1
your	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
estate	1
and	1
your	1
book	1
oh	1
but	1
i	1
feel	1
and	1
particularly	1
just	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
your	1
fault	1
he	1
said	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
doesn	1
t	1
count	1
i	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
halfheartedly	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
care	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
as	1
i	1
care	1
for	1
you	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
like	1
a	1
task	1
that	1
is	1
set	1
me	1
well	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
say	1
about	1
papa	1
asked	1
kitty	1
is	1
he	1
a	1
poor	1
creature	1
then	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
he	1
no	1
but	1
then	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
simplicity	1
the	1
straightforwardness	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
got	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
nothing	1
and	1
i	1

about	1
it	1

s	1
all	1
your	1
doing	1
before	1
there	1

this	1
too	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
towards	1
her	1
waist	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
i	1
put	1
all	1
my	1
energies	1
into	1
work	1
now	1
i	1

and	1
i	1

on	1
her	1
black	1
hair	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
children	1
gaily	1
and	1
good	1
humoredly	1
looking	1
after	1
them	1
and	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
visibly	1
excited	1
at	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
receiving	1
a	1
declaration	1
from	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
cared	1
for	1
was	1
very	1
attractive	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
walked	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
never	1
left	1
off	1
admiring	1
her	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
delightful	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
lips	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
he	1
knew	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
conscious	1
that	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
something	1
special	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
long	1
long	1
ago	1
and	1
only	1
once	1
in	1
his	1
early	1
youth	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
happiness	1
in	1
being	1
near	1
her	1
continually	1
grew	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
reached	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
a	1
huge	1
slender	1
stalked	1
agaric	1
fungus	1
in	1
her	1
basket	1
he	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
noticing	1
the	1
flush	1
of	1
glad	1
and	1
alarmed	1
excitement	1
that	1
overspread	1
her	1
face	1
he	1
was	1
confused	1
himself	1
and	1
smiled	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
silence	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
said	1
too	1
much	1
if	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
make	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
like	1
a	1
boy	1
to	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
pick	1
by	1
myself	1
apart	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
or	1
else	1
my	1
efforts	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
show	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
on	1
low	1
silky	1
grass	1
between	1
old	1
birch	1
trees	1
standing	1
far	1
apart	1
and	1
went	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
where	1
between	1
the	1
white	1
birch	1
trunks	1
there	1
were	1
gray	1
trunks	1
of	1
aspen	1
and	1
dark	1
bushes	1
of	1
hazel	1
walking	1
some	1
forty	1
paces	1
away	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
knowing	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
stood	1
still	1
behind	1
a	1
bushy	1
spindle	1
tree	1
in	1
full	1
flower	1
with	1
its	1
rosy	1
red	1
catkins	1
it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
still	1
all	1
round	1
him	1
only	1
overhead	1
in	1
the	1
birches	1
under	1
which	1
he	1
stood	1
the	1
flies	1
like	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
bees	1
buzzed	1
unceasingly	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
voices	1
were	1
floated	1
across	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
heard	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
varenka	1
s	1
contralto	1
voice	1
calling	1
grisha	1
and	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
delight	1
passed	1
over	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
face	1
conscious	1
of	1
this	1
smile	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disapprovingly	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
condition	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
a	1
cigar	1
he	1
began	1
lighting	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
a	1
match	1
to	1
light	1
against	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
a	1
birch	1
tree	1
the	1
soft	1
scales	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
bark	1
rubbed	1
off	1
the	1
phosphorus	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
went	1
out	1
at	1
last	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
matches	1
burned	1
and	1
the	1
fragrant	1
cigar	1
smoke	1
hovering	1
uncertainly	1
in	1
flat	1
wide	1
coils	1
stretched	1
away	1
forwards	1
and	1
upwards	1
over	1
a	1
bush	1
under	1
the	1
overhanging	1
branches	1
of	1
a	1
birch	1
tree	1
watching	1
the	1
streak	1
of	1
smoke	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
walked	1
gently	1
on	1
deliberating	1
on	1
his	1
position	1
why	1
not	1
he	1
thought	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
a	1
passing	1
fancy	1
or	1
a	1
passion	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
this	1
attraction	1
this	1
mutual	1
attraction	1
i	1
can	1
call	1
it	1
a	1
mutual	1
attraction	1
but	1
if	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
contradiction	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
bent	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
if	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
this	1
attraction	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
false	1
to	1
my	1
vocation	1
and	1
my	1
duty	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
so	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
against	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
lost	1
marie	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
myself	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
remain	1
faithful	1
to	1
her	1
memory	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
against	1
my	1
feeling	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
great	1
thing	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
feeling	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
this	1
consideration	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
importance	1
for	1
him	1
personally	1
but	1
would	1
only	1
perhaps	1
detract	1
from	1
his	1
romantic	1
character	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
others	1
but	1
apart	1
from	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
i	1
searched	1
i	1
should	1
never	1
find	1
anything	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
my	1
feeling	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
choosing	1
by	1
considerations	1
of	1
suitability	1
alone	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
found	1
anything	1
better	1
however	1
many	1
women	1
and	1
girls	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
united	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
all	1
positively	1
all	1
the	1
qualities	1
he	1
would	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
she	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
and	1
freshness	1
of	1
youth	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
consciously	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
ought	1
to	1
love	1
that	1
was	1
one	1
thing	1
another	1
point	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
worldly	1
but	1
had	1
an	1
unmistakable	1
distaste	1
for	1
worldly	1
society	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
society	1
which	1
were	1
absolutely	1
essential	1
to	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
share	1
his	1
life	1
thirdly	1
she	1
was	1
religious	1
and	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
unconsciously	1
religious	1
and	1
good	1
as	1
kitty	1
for	1
example	1
was	1
but	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
founded	1
on	1
religious	1
principles	1
even	1
in	1
trifling	1
matters	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
found	1
in	1
her	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
she	1
was	1
poor	1
and	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
so	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
bring	1
with	1
her	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
relations	1
and	1
their	1
influence	1
into	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
house	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
now	1
in	1
kitty	1
s	1
case	1
she	1
would	1
owe	1
everything	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
which	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
desired	1
too	1
for	1
his	1
future	1
family	1
life	1
and	1
this	1
girl	1
who	1
united	1
all	1
these	1
qualities	1
loved	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
modest	1
man	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
consideration	1
against	1
it	1
his	1
age	1
but	1
he	1
came	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
lived	1
family	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
gray	1
hair	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
him	1
for	1
forty	1
and	1
he	1
remembered	1
varenka	1
s	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
russia	1
that	1
men	1
of	1
fifty	1
thought	1
themselves	1
old	1

what	1
did	1
the	1
mere	1
reckoning	1
of	1
years	1
matter	1
when	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
young	1
in	1
heart	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
youth	1
to	1
feel	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
when	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
glowing	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
slanting	1

the	1
gracious	1
figure	1
of	1
varenka	1
in	1
her	1
yellow	1
gown	1
with	1
her	1
basket	1
walking	1
lightly	1
by	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
birch	1
tree	1
and	1
when	1
this	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
varenka	1
blended	1
so	1
harmoniously	1
with	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
yellow	1

lying	1

a	1

came	1
over	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
varenka	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
crouched	1
down	1
to	1
pick	1
a	1
mushroom	1

varvara	1

when	1
i	1
was	1
very	1
young	1
i	1
set	1
before	1
myself	1
the	1
ideal	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
i	1
loved	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
call	1
my	1
wife	1
i	1
have	1
lived	1
through	1
a	1
long	1
life	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
i	1
have	1
met	1
what	1
i	1
sought	1
in	1
you	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
hand	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
saying	1
this	1
to	1
himself	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
ten	1
paces	1
from	1
varvara	1
kneeling	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
over	1
the	1
mushrooms	1
to	1
guard	1
them	1
from	1
grisha	1
she	1
was	1
calling	1
little	1
masha	1
come	1
here	1
little	1
ones	1
there	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
her	1
sweet	1
deep	1
voice	1
seeing	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
approaching	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
her	1
position	1
but	1
everything	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
well	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
some	1
she	1
asked	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
white	1
kerchief	1
turning	1
her	1
handsome	1
gently	1
smiling	1
face	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
one	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
did	1
you	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
busy	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
thronged	1
about	1
her	1
that	1
one	1
too	1
near	1
the	1
twig	1
she	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
little	1
masha	1
a	1
little	1
fungus	1
split	1
in	1
half	1
across	1
its	1
rosy	1
cap	1
by	1
the	1
dry	1
grass	1
from	1
under	1
which	1
it	1
thrust	1
itself	1
varenka	1
got	1
up	1
while	1
masha	1
picked	1
the	1
fungus	1
breaking	1
it	1
into	1
two	1
white	1
halves	1
this	1
brings	1
back	1
my	1
childhood	1
she	1
added	1
moving	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
beside	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
they	1
walked	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
steps	1
in	1
silence	1
varenka	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
she	1
guessed	1
of	1
what	1
and	1
felt	1
faint	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
panic	1
they	1
had	1
walked	1
so	1
far	1
away	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
hear	1
them	1
now	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
varenka	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
after	1
a	1
silence	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
easier	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
than	1
after	1
talking	1
about	1
mushrooms	1
but	1
against	1
her	1
own	1
will	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
accidentally	1
varenka	1
said	1
so	1
you	1
found	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
fewer	1
though	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
sighed	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
he	1
was	1
annoyed	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
about	1
the	1
mushrooms	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
she	1
had	1
uttered	1
about	1
her	1
childhood	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
some	1
length	1
as	1
though	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
observation	1
in	1
response	1
to	1
her	1
last	1
words	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
edible	1
funguses	1
are	1
found	1
principally	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
though	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
them	1
apart	1
some	1
minutes	1
more	1
passed	1
they	1
moved	1
still	1
further	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
were	1
quite	1
alone	1
varenka	1
s	1
heart	1
throbbed	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
heard	1
it	1
beating	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
turning	1
red	1
and	1
pale	1
and	1
red	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
koznishev	1
after	1
her	1
position	1
with	1
madame	1
stahl	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
imagination	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
happiness	1
besides	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
certain	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
this	1
moment	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
she	1
felt	1
frightened	1
she	1
dreaded	1
both	1
his	1
speaking	1
and	1
his	1
not	1
speaking	1
now	1
or	1
never	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
felt	1
too	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
the	1
flushed	1
cheeks	1
and	1
the	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
of	1
varenka	1
betrayed	1
a	1
painful	1
suspense	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
saw	1
it	1
and	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
he	1
felt	1
even	1
that	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
now	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
slight	1
to	1
her	1
rapidly	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
he	1
ran	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
arguments	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
decision	1
he	1
even	1
said	1
over	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
offer	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
those	1
words	1
some	1
utterly	1
unexpected	1
reflection	1
that	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
made	1
him	1
ask	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
birch	1
mushroom	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
mushroom	1
varenka	1
s	1
lips	1
quivered	1
with	1
emotion	1
as	1
she	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
part	1
there	1
is	1
scarcely	1
any	1
difference	1
it	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
stalk	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
uttered	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
said	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
and	1
their	1
emotion	1
which	1
had	1
up	1
to	1
then	1
been	1
continually	1
growing	1
more	1
intense	1
began	1
to	1
subside	1
the	1
birch	1
mushroom	1
s	1
stalk	1
suggests	1
a	1
dark	1
man	1
s	1
chin	1
after	1
two	1
days	1
without	1
shaving	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
speaking	1
quite	1
calmly	1
now	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
answered	1
varenka	1
smiling	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
their	1
walk	1
changed	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
turn	1
towards	1
the	1
children	1
varenka	1
felt	1
both	1
sore	1
and	1
ashamed	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
home	1
again	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
subject	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
thought	1
his	1
previous	1
decision	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
mistaken	1
one	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
false	1
to	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
marie	1
gently	1
children	1
gently	1
levin	1
shouted	1
quite	1
angrily	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
standing	1
before	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
protect	1
her	1
when	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
children	1
flew	1
with	1
shrieks	1
of	1
delight	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
behind	1
the	1
children	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
varenka	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
kitty	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
varenka	1
she	1
saw	1
from	1
the	1
calm	1
and	1
somewhat	1
crestfallen	1
faces	1
of	1
both	1
that	1
her	1
plans	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
off	1
well	1
her	1
husband	1
questioned	1
her	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
home	1
again	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
bite	1
said	1
kitty	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking	1
recalling	1
her	1
father	1
a	1
likeness	1
levin	1
often	1
noticed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
how	1
doesn	1
t	1
bite	1
i	1
ll	1
show	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
taking	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
hand	1
lifting	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mouth	1
and	1
just	1
faintly	1
brushing	1
it	1
with	1
closed	1
lips	1
like	1
a	1
kiss	1
on	1
a	1
priest	1
s	1
hand	1
which	1
didn	1
t	1
it	1
bite	1
with	1
he	1
said	1
laughing	1
both	1
but	1
it	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
like	1
this	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
peasants	1
coming	1
oh	1
they	1
didn	1
t	1
see	1
chapter	1
6	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
tea	1
the	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
balcony	1
and	1
talked	1
as	1
though	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened	1
though	1
they	1
all	1
especially	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
varenka	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
happened	1
an	1
event	1
which	1
though	1
negative	1
was	1
of	1
very	1
great	1
importance	1
they	1
both	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
rather	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
after	1
an	1
examination	1
which	1
has	1
left	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
class	1
or	1
shut	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
school	1
forever	1
everyone	1
present	1
feeling	1
too	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
talked	1
eagerly	1
about	1
extraneous	1
subjects	1
levin	1
and	1
kitty	1
were	1
particularly	1
happy	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
their	1
love	1
that	1
evening	1
and	1
their	1
happiness	1
in	1
their	1
love	1
seemed	1
to	1
imply	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
slur	1
on	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
they	1
felt	1
a	1
prick	1
of	1
conscience	1
mark	1
my	1
words	1
alexander	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
that	1
evening	1
they	1
were	1
expecting	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
by	1
train	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
written	1
that	1
possibly	1
he	1
might	1
come	1
too	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
why	1
the	1
princess	1
went	1
on	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
young	1
people	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
papa	1
has	1
left	1
us	1
alone	1

i	1
shall	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
you	1
children	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
sighing	1
mournfully	1
what	1
nonsense	1
mamma	1
both	1
the	1
daughters	1
fell	1
upon	1
her	1
at	1
once	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
he	1
is	1
feeling	1
why	1
now	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
unexpected	1
quiver	1
in	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
voice	1
her	1
daughters	1
were	1
silent	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
maman	1
always	1
finds	1
something	1
to	1
be	1
miserable	1
about	1
they	1
said	1
in	1
that	1
glance	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
happy	1
as	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
useful	1
as	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
extremely	1
miserable	1
both	1
on	1
her	1

her	1

agafea	1

suddenly	1
of	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
a	1
mysterious	1
air	1
and	1
a	1
face	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
about	1

difficult	1
lessons	1
of	1
latin	1
and	1
arithmetic	1
levin	1
had	1
offered	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
place	1
but	1
the	1
mother	1
having	1
once	1
overheard	1
levin	1
s	1
lesson	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
given	1
exactly	1
as	1
the	1
teacher	1
in	1
moscow	1
had	1
given	1
it	1
said	1
resolutely	1
though	1
with	1
much	1
embarrassment	1
and	1
anxiety	1
not	1
to	1
mortify	1
levin	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
keep	1
strictly	1
to	1
the	1
book	1
as	1
the	1
teacher	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
better	1
undertake	1
it	1
again	1
herself	1
levin	1
was	1
amazed	1
both	1
at	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
who	1
by	1
neglecting	1
his	1
duty	1
threw	1
upon	1
the	1
mother	1
the	1
supervision	1
of	1
studies	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
comprehension	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
teachers	1
for	1
teaching	1
the	1
children	1
so	1
badly	1
but	1
he	1
promised	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
lessons	1
exactly	1
as	1
she	1
wished	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
teaching	1
grisha	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
so	1
took	1
little	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
often	1
forgot	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
lesson	1
so	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
today	1
no	1
i	1
m	1
going	1
dolly	1

sit	1
still	1
he	1
said	1
we	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
all	1
properly	1
like	1
the	1
book	1
only	1
when	1
stiva	1
comes	1
and	1
we	1
go	1
out	1
shooting	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
miss	1
it	1
and	1
levin	1
went	1
to	1
grisha	1
varenka	1
was	1
saying	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
to	1
kitty	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
happy	1
well	1
ordered	1
household	1
of	1
the	1
levins	1
varenka	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
making	1
herself	1
useful	1
i	1

see	1

the	1
supper	1
you	1
sit	1
still	1

said	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
yes	1
yes	1

and	1
i	1
will	1
see	1
about	1

varenka	1
vanished	1
with	1
her	1
what	1
a	1
nice	1

are	1
expecting	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
today	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
evidently	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
conversation	1
about	1
varenka	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
two	1
sons	1
in	1
law	1
more	1
unlike	1
than	1
yours	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1

all	1

either	1
sinks	1
into	1
apathy	1

very	1
heedless	1

agreed	1
to	1
everything	1
kitty	1

angry	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
for	1
appealing	1
to	1
sergey	1

to	1
judge	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
matter	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
snorting	1
of	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels	1
on	1
the	1
gravel	1
dolly	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
meet	1
her	1

when	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
below	1
where	1
grisha	1
was	1
having	1
his	1

levin	1
had	1
been	1
mistaken	1
in	1
taking	1
the	1
person	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
saw	1
beside	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
not	1
the	1
prince	1
but	1
a	1
handsome	1
stout	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
scotch	1
cap	1
with	1
long	1
ends	1
of	1
ribbon	1
behind	1
this	1
was	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
a	1
distant	1
cousin	1
of	1
the	1
shtcherbatskys	1
a	1
brilliant	1
young	1
gentleman	1
in	1
petersburg	1
and	1
moscow	1
society	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
and	1
a	1
keen	1
sportsman	1
as	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
said	1
introducing	1
him	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
abashed	1
by	1
the	1
disappointment	1
caused	1
by	1
his	1
having	1
come	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
veslovsky	1
greeted	1
levin	1
gaily	1
claiming	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
snatching	1
up	1
grisha	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
lifted	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
pointer	1
that	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
but	1
walked	1
behind	1
he	1
was	1
rather	1
vexed	1
at	1
the	1
non	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
whom	1
he	1
liked	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
saw	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
this	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
a	1
quite	1
uncongenial	1
and	1
superfluous	1
person	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
still	1
more	1
uncongenial	1
and	1
superfluous	1
when	1
on	1
approaching	1
the	1
steps	1
where	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
children	1
and	1
grown	1
up	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
much	1
excitement	1

warm	1

he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
once	1
more	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
holding	1
it	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
and	1
patting	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
levin	1
who	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
now	1
looked	1
darkly	1
at	1
everyone	1

everything	1
displeased	1
him	1

was	1
it	1
he	1
kissed	1
yesterday	1
with	1

at	1

s	1
tender	1
demonstrations	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1

he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
her	1
either	1
she	1
doesn	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
so	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
so	1
pleased	1
about	1

thought	1
levin	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
welcomed	1
this	1
vassenka	1
with	1
his	1
ribbons	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house	1
even	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
too	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
unpleasant	1
with	1
the	1
show	1
of	1
cordiality	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
met	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
though	1
levin	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
neither	1
liked	1
nor	1
respected	1
oblonsky	1
and	1
varenka	1
even	1
she	1
seemed	1
hateful	1
with	1
her	1
air	1
sainte	1
nitouche	1
making	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
this	1
gentleman	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
getting	1
married	1
and	1
more	1
hateful	1
than	1
anyone	1
was	1
kitty	1
for	1
falling	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
gaiety	1
with	1
which	1
this	1
gentleman	1
regarded	1
his	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
holiday	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
everyone	1
else	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
unpleasant	1
was	1
that	1
particular	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
responded	1
to	1
his	1
smile	1
noisily	1
talking	1
they	1

he	1

ruthlessly	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1

without	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
at	1

joined	1
in	1
the	1

though	1
never	1
pausing	1
in	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
varenka	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1

an	1
eager	1
and	1
mysterious	1
conversation	1
going	1
on	1
between	1
stepan	1

veslovsky	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
he	1
saw	1
on	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
face	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
real	1
feeling	1
as	1
she	1
gazed	1
with	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
handsome	1
face	1
of	1

and	1
she	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
do	1
you	1
know	1

arkadyevna	1
then	1
veslovsky	1
asked	1
her	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
fascinating	1
woman	1
yes	1
she	1
answered	1
veslovsky	1
crimsoning	1
still	1
more	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
across	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1

you	1
going	1
shooting	1
then	1
tomorrow	1
she	1
said	1
his	1
jealousy	1
had	1
in	1
these	1
few	1
moments	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
flush	1
that	1
had	1
overspread	1
her	1
cheeks	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
veslovsky	1
gone	1
far	1
indeed	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
her	1
words	1
he	1
construed	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
fashion	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
afterwards	1
to	1
recall	1
it	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
clear	1
that	1
in	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
shooting	1
all	1
she	1
cared	1
to	1
know	1
was	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
that	1
pleasure	1
to	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
with	1
whom	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
yes	1
i	1
m	1
going	1
he	1
answered	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
voice	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
himself	1
no	1
better	1
spend	1
the	1
day	1
here	1
tomorrow	1
or	1
dolly	1
won	1
t	1
see	1
anything	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
said	1
kitty	1
the	1
motive	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
words	1
was	1
interpreted	1
by	1
levin	1
thus	1
don	1
t	1
separate	1
me	1
from	1
him	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
about	1
your	1
going	1
but	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
enjoy	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
this	1
delightful	1
young	1
man	1
oh	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
we	1
ll	1
stay	1
here	1
tomorrow	1
levin	1
answered	1
with	1
peculiar	1
amiability	1
vassenka	1
meanwhile	1
utterly	1
unsuspecting	1
the	1
misery	1
his	1
presence	1
had	1
occasioned	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
after	1
kitty	1
and	1
watching	1
her	1
with	1
smiling	1
and	1
admiring	1
eyes	1
he	1
followed	1
her	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
look	1
he	1
turned	1
white	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
breathe	1
how	1
dare	1
he	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
wife	1
like	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
boiled	1
within	1
him	1
tomorrow	1
then	1
do	1
please	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
said	1
vassenka	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
again	1
crossing	1
his	1
leg	1
as	1
his	1
habit	1
was	1
levin	1
s	1
jealousy	1
went	1
further	1
still	1
already	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
a	1
deceived	1
husband	1
looked	1
upon	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
lover	1
as	1
simply	1
necessary	1
to	1
provide	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
conveniences	1
and	1
pleasures	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
polite	1
and	1
hospitable	1
inquiries	1
of	1
vassenka	1
about	1
his	1
shooting	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
his	1
boots	1
and	1
agreed	1
to	1
go	1
shooting	1
next	1
day	1
happily	1
for	1
levin	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
cut	1
short	1
his	1
agonies	1
by	1
getting	1
up	1
herself	1
and	1
advising	1
kitty	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
but	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
escape	1
another	1
agony	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
good	1
night	1
to	1
his	1
hostess	1
vassenka	1
would	1
again	1
have	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
but	1
kitty	1
reddening	1
drew	1
back	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
naïve	1
bluntness	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
scolded	1
her	1
afterwards	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
that	1
fashion	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
eyes	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
having	1
allowed	1
such	1
relations	1
to	1
arise	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
showing	1
so	1
awkwardly	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
them	1
why	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
who	1
after	1
drinking	1
several	1
glasses	1
of	1
wine	1
at	1
supper	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
most	1
charming	1
and	1
sentimental	1
humor	1
look	1
kitty	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
moon	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
risen	1
behind	1
the	1
lime	1
trees	1
how	1
exquisite	1
veslovsky	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
serenade	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
splendid	1
voice	1
we	1
practiced	1
songs	1
together	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
he	1
has	1
brought	1
some	1
lovely	1
songs	1
with	1
him	1
two	1
new	1
ones	1
varvara	1
andreevna	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
sing	1
some	1
duets	1
when	1
the	1
party	1
had	1
broken	1
up	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
walked	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
about	1
the	1
avenue	1
with	1
veslovsky	1
their	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
singing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
songs	1
levin	1
hearing	1
these	1
voices	1
sat	1
scowling	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
bedroom	1
and	1
maintained	1
an	1
obstinate	1
silence	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
wrong	1
but	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
she	1
hazarded	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
there	1
perhaps	1
something	1
you	1
disliked	1
about	1
veslovsky	1
it	1
all	1
burst	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
humiliated	1
himself	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
and	1
that	1
exasperated	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
stood	1
facing	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
glittering	1
menacingly	1
under	1
his	1
scowling	1
brows	1
and	1
he	1
squeezed	1
his	1
strong	1
arms	1
across	1
his	1
chest	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
straining	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
hold	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
grim	1
and	1
even	1
cruel	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
had	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
suffering	1
which	1
touched	1
her	1
his	1
jaws	1
were	1
twitching	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
kept	1
breaking	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
jealous	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
nasty	1
word	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
jealous	1
and	1
believe	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
say	1
what	1
i	1
feel	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
awful	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
jealous	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
wounded	1
humiliated	1
that	1
anybody	1
dare	1
think	1
that	1
anybody	1
dare	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
with	1
eyes	1
like	1
that	1
eyes	1
like	1
what	1
said	1
kitty	1
trying	1
as	1
conscientiously	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
recall	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
gesture	1
of	1
that	1
evening	1
and	1
every	1
shade	1
implied	1
in	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
did	1
think	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
something	1
precisely	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
crossed	1
over	1
after	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
but	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
own	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
even	1
more	1
unable	1
to	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
say	1
so	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
increase	1
his	1
suffering	1
and	1
what	1
can	1
there	1
possibly	1
be	1
attractive	1
about	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
ah	1
he	1
cried	1
clutching	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
you	1
shouldn	1
t	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
attractive	1
then	1
oh	1
no	1
kostya	1
oh	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
oh	1
do	1
listen	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
pained	1
commiseration	1
why	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
thinking	1
about	1
when	1
for	1
me	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
no	1
one	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
me	1
never	1
to	1
see	1
anyone	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
offended	1
at	1
his	1
jealousy	1
she	1
was	1
angry	1
that	1
the	1
slightest	1
amusement	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
innocent	1
should	1
be	1
forbidden	1
her	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
would	1
readily	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
not	1
merely	1
such	1
trifles	1
but	1
everything	1
for	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
agony	1
he	1
was	1
suffering	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
the	1
horror	1
and	1
comedy	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
desperate	1
whisper	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
done	1
nothing	1
improper	1
positively	1
except	1
his	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
airs	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
sits	1
on	1
his	1
legs	1
he	1
thinks	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
form	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
m	1
obliged	1
to	1
be	1
civil	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
kostya	1
you	1
re	1
exaggerating	1
said	1
kitty	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
shown	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
jealousy	1
the	1
most	1
awful	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
always	1
are	1
and	1
especially	1
now	1
when	1
to	1

why	1

abuse	1
him	1

while	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
at	1

well	1
well	1
levin	1
said	1
in	1
dismay	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
about	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
breathless	1
with	1
emotion	1
levin	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
then	1
he	1
scanned	1
her	1
pale	1
and	1
distressed	1
face	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
katya	1

were	1
going	1
shooting	1
after	1
much	1
whining	1
and	1
darting	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
had	1
sat	1
herself	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
wagonette	1
beside	1
the	1
coachman	1
and	1
disapproving	1
of	1
the	1
delay	1
was	1
excitedly	1
watching	1
the	1
door	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
out	1

was	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
in	1
new	1
high	1
boots	1
that	1
reached	1
half	1
way	1
up	1
his	1
thick	1
thighs	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
blouse	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
russian	1

without	1
a	1
sling	1
laska	1
flew	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
welcomed	1
him	1
and	1
jumping	1
up	1
asked	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
way	1
whether	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
coming	1
soon	1
but	1
getting	1
no	1
answer	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
post	1
of	1
observation	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
repose	1
again	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
one	1
ear	1
pricked	1
up	1
to	1
listen	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
with	1
a	1
creak	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
spot	1
and	1
tan	1
pointer	1

flew	1
out	1
running	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
and	1
turning	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
himself	1
followed	1
with	1
a	1
gun	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
cigar	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
good	1
dog	1
good	1
dog	1
krak	1
he	1
cried	1
encouragingly	1
to	1
the	1
dog	1
who	1
put	1
his	1
paws	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
catching	1
at	1
his	1
game	1
bag	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
rough	1
leggings	1
and	1
spats	1
in	1
torn	1
trousers	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
coat	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
wreck	1
of	1
a	1
hat	1
of	1
indefinite	1
form	1
but	1
his	1
gun	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
patent	1
was	1
a	1
perfect	1
gem	1
and	1
his	1
game	1
bag	1
and	1
cartridge	1
belt	1
though	1
worn	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
quality	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
notion	1
before	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
truly	1
chic	1
for	1
a	1
sportsman	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
tatters	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
shooting	1
outfit	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
quality	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
radiant	1
in	1
his	1
rags	1
graceful	1
well	1
fed	1
and	1
joyous	1
a	1
typical	1
russian	1
nobleman	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
next	1
time	1
he	1
went	1
shooting	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
adopt	1
the	1
same	1
get	1
up	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
about	1
our	1
host	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
young	1
wife	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
yes	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
charming	1
one	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
dressed	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
s	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
again	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
guessed	1
right	1
levin	1
had	1
run	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
once	1
more	1
if	1
she	1
forgave	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
idiocy	1
yesterday	1
and	1
moreover	1
to	1
beg	1
her	1
for	1
christ	1
s	1
sake	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
careful	1
the	1
great	1
thing	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
keep	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
they	1
might	1
any	1
minute	1
push	1
against	1
her	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
declare	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
going	1
away	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
to	1
beg	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
a	1
note	1
next	1
morning	1
by	1
a	1
servant	1
on	1
horseback	1
to	1
write	1
him	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
two	1
words	1
only	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
her	1
kitty	1
was	1
distressed	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
was	1
at	1
parting	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
eager	1
figure	1
looking	1
big	1
and	1
strong	1
in	1
his	1
shooting	1
boots	1
and	1
his	1
white	1
blouse	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sportsman	1
elation	1
and	1
excitement	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
forgot	1
her	1
own	1
chagrin	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
pleasure	1
and	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
him	1
cheerfully	1
pardon	1
gentlemen	1
he	1
said	1
running	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
have	1
you	1
put	1
the	1
lunch	1
in	1
why	1
is	1
the	1
chestnut	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
well	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
matter	1
laska	1
down	1
go	1
and	1
lie	1
down	1
put	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
oxen	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
herdsman	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
steps	1
with	1
some	1
question	1
excuse	1
me	1
here	1
comes	1
another	1
villain	1
levin	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wagonette	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
taken	1
his	1
seat	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
carpenter	1
who	1
came	1
towards	1
the	1
steps	1
with	1
a	1
rule	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
yesterday	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
re	1
detaining	1
me	1
well	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
would	1
your	1
honor	1
let	1
me	1
make	1
another	1
turning	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
three	1
steps	1
to	1
add	1
and	1
we	1
make	1
it	1
just	1
fit	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
convenient	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
listened	1
to	1
me	1
levin	1
answered	1
with	1
annoyance	1
i	1
said	1
put	1
the	1
lines	1
and	1
then	1
fit	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
now	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
setting	1
it	1
right	1
do	1
as	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
staircase	1
the	1
point	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
lodge	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
built	1
the	1
carpenter	1
had	1
spoiled	1
the	1
staircase	1
fitting	1
it	1
together	1
without	1
calculating	1
the	1
space	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
fill	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
steps	1
were	1
all	1
sloping	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
place	1
now	1
the	1
carpenter	1
wanted	1
keeping	1
the	1
same	1
staircase	1
to	1
add	1
three	1
steps	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
better	1
but	1
where	1
s	1
your	1
staircase	1
coming	1
out	1
with	1
its	1
three	1
steps	1
why	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
sir	1
the	1
carpenter	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
smile	1
it	1
comes	1
out	1
right	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
spot	1
it	1
starts	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
persuasive	1
gesture	1
it	1
comes	1
down	1
and	1
comes	1
down	1
and	1
comes	1
out	1
but	1
three	1
steps	1
will	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
length	1
too	1
where	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
why	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
ll	1
start	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
so	1
the	1
carpenter	1
said	1
obstinately	1
and	1
convincingly	1
it	1
ll	1
reach	1
the	1
ceiling	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
why	1
it	1
ll	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
up	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
like	1
this	1
levin	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
ramrod	1
and	1
began	1
sketching	1
him	1
the	1
staircase	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
there	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
as	1
your	1
honor	1
likes	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
gleam	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
obviously	1
understanding	1
the	1
thing	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
seems	1
it	1
ll	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
one	1
well	1
then	1
do	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
told	1
levin	1
shouted	1
seating	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
wagonette	1
down	1
hold	1
the	1
dogs	1
philip	1
levin	1
felt	1
now	1
at	1
leaving	1
behind	1
all	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
household	1
cares	1
such	1
an	1
eager	1
sense	1
of	1
joy	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
expectation	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
talk	1
besides	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
concentrated	1
excitement	1
that	1
every	1
sportsman	1
experiences	1
as	1
he	1
approaches	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
anything	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
doubt	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
start	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
kolpensky	1
marsh	1
whether	1
laska	1
would	1
show	1
to	1
advantage	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
krak	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
shoot	1
well	1
that	1
day	1
himself	1
not	1
to	1
disgrace	1
himself	1
before	1
a	1
new	1
spectator	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
outdone	1
by	1
oblonsky	1
that	1
too	1
was	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
crossed	1
his	1
brain	1
oblonsky	1
was	1
feeling	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
not	1
talkative	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
kept	1
up	1
alone	1
a	1
ceaseless	1
flow	1
of	1
cheerful	1
chatter	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
levin	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
unfair	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
vassenka	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
nice	1
fellow	1
simple	1
good	1
hearted	1
and	1
very	1
good	1
humored	1
if	1
levin	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
married	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
him	1
levin	1
rather	1
disliked	1
his	1
holiday	1
attitude	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
assumption	1
of	1
elegance	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
assumed	1
a	1
high	1
degree	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
disputed	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
nails	1
and	1
a	1
stylish	1
cap	1
and	1
everything	1
else	1
to	1
correspond	1
but	1
this	1
could	1
be	1
forgiven	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
nature	1
and	1
good	1
breeding	1
levin	1
liked	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
education	1
for	1
speaking	1
french	1
and	1
english	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
excellent	1
accent	1
and	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
world	1
vassenka	1
was	1
extremely	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
left	1
horse	1
a	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
don	1
steppes	1
he	1
kept	1
praising	1
him	1
enthusiastically	1
how	1
fine	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
galloping	1
over	1
the	1
steppes	1
on	1
a	1
steppe	1
horse	1
eh	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
imagined	1
riding	1
on	1
a	1
steppe	1
horse	1
as	1
something	1
wild	1
and	1
romantic	1
and	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
but	1
his	1
simplicity	1
particularly	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
his	1
good	1
looks	1
his	1
amiable	1
smile	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
his	1
movements	1
was	1
very	1
attractive	1
either	1
because	1
his	1
nature	1
was	1
sympathetic	1
to	1
levin	1
or	1
because	1
levin	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
his	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
by	1
seeing	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
him	1
anyway	1
he	1
liked	1
his	1
society	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
driven	1
over	1
two	1
miles	1
from	1
home	1
veslovsky	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
felt	1
for	1
a	1
cigar	1
and	1
his	1
pocketbook	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
them	1
or	1
left	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
pocketbook	1
there	1
were	1
thirty	1
seven	1
pounds	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
matter	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
levin	1
i	1
ll	1
gallop	1
home	1
on	1
that	1
left	1
trace	1
horse	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
splendid	1
eh	1
he	1
said	1
preparing	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
no	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
answered	1
levin	1
calculating	1
that	1
vassenka	1
could	1
hardly	1
weigh	1
less	1
than	1
seventeen	1
stone	1
i	1
ll	1
send	1
the	1
coachman	1
the	1
coachman	1
rode	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
trace	1
horse	1
and	1
levin	1
himself	1
drove	1

remaining	1
pair	1

what	1
s	1
our	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign	1

us	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
our	1
plan	1
is	1
this	1
now	1
we	1
re	1
driving	1
to	1
gvozdyov	1
in	1
gvozdyov	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
grouse	1
marsh	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
and	1
beyond	1
gvozdyov	1
come	1
some	1
magnificent	1
snipe	1
marshes	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
grouse	1
too	1
it	1
s	1
hot	1
now	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
get	1
there	1

s	1
fifteen	1
miles	1
or	1
so	1
towards	1

some	1
evening	1
shooting	1

spend	1
the	1
night	1

the	1
bigger	1
moors	1
and	1
is	1
there	1

reserve	1
ourselves	1
besides	1
it	1

hot	1
there	1

they	1
were	1
near	1

shoot	1
them	1
over	1
any	1

they	1

only	1
little	1

there	1

room	1
for	1

so	1
with	1

insincerity	1
he	1

doubted	1
there	1
being	1
anything	1
to	1
shoot	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
little	1

by	1

with	1
the	1
wagonette	1
and	1
looked	1
enviously	1
at	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
they	1
walked	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
marsh	1

little	1
birds	1

peewits	1

all	1
the	1

you	1

said	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
clambering	1
awkwardly	1
into	1
the	1
wagonette	1
with	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
his	1
peewit	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
how	1
splendidly	1

well	1

we	1
soon	1
be	1
getting	1
to	1
the	1
real	1
place	1
the	1
horses	1
started	1
off	1
suddenly	1
levin	1
knocked	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
someone	1
s	1
gun	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
a	1
shot	1
the	1
gun	1
did	1
actually	1
go	1
off	1
first	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
how	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
had	1
pulled	1
only	1
one	1
trigger	1
and	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
other	1
hammer	1
still	1
cocked	1
the	1
charge	1
flew	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
without	1
doing	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
laughed	1
reprovingly	1
at	1
veslovsky	1
but	1
levin	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
reprove	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
any	1
reproach	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
danger	1
he	1
had	1
incurred	1
and	1
the	1
bump	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
on	1
levin	1
s	1
forehead	1
and	1
besides	1
veslovsky	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
so	1
naïvely	1
distressed	1
and	1
then	1
laughed	1
so	1
good	1
humoredly	1
and	1
infectiously	1
at	1
their	1
general	1
dismay	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
laugh	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
second	1
marsh	1
which	1
was	1
fairly	1
large	1
and	1
would	1
inevitably	1
take	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
shoot	1
over	1
levin	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
them	1
to	1
pass	1
it	1
by	1
but	1
veslovsky	1
again	1
overpersuaded	1
him	1
again	1
as	1
the	1
marsh	1
was	1
narrow	1

of	1

handed	1
the	1
reins	1
to	1

and	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
marsh	1
laska	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
plaintively	1
whining	1
and	1
fretting	1
against	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
her	1
treatment	1
flew	1
straight	1
ahead	1
to	1
a	1
hopeful	1
place	1
that	1
levin	1
knew	1
well	1

after	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
familiar	1
breeding	1
places	1

was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
earnestness	1
in	1
laska	1

exploration	1
a	1

not	1
divert	1
her	1
attention	1
for	1

than	1
an	1
instant	1
she	1
made	1
one	1
circuit	1
round	1
the	1
clump	1
of	1
reeds	1
was	1
beginning	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
suddenly	1
quivered	1
with	1
excitement	1
and	1
became	1
motionless	1
come	1
come	1
stiva	1
shouted	1
levin	1
feeling	1
his	1
heart	1
beginning	1
to	1
beat	1
more	1
violently	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
shutter	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
back	1
from	1
his	1
straining	1
ears	1
all	1
sounds	1
confused	1

loud	1
began	1
to	1
beat	1
on	1
his	1
hearing	1
losing	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
distance	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
mistaking	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
brittle	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
twigs	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
trodden	1
taking	1
this	1
sound	1
for	1
the	1
flying	1
of	1
a	1
grouse	1
he	1
heard	1
too	1
not	1
far	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
splashing	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
explain	1
to	1
himself	1
picking	1
his	1
steps	1
he	1
moved	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dog	1

it	1
not	1
a	1
grouse	1
but	1
a	1
snipe	1
flew	1
up	1
from	1
beside	1
the	1
dog	1
levin	1
had	1
lifted	1
his	1
gun	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
aim	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
splashing	1
grew	1
louder	1
came	1
closer	1
and	1
was	1
joined	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
veslovsky	1
s	1
voice	1
shouting	1
something	1
with	1
strange	1
loudness	1
levin	1
saw	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
gun	1
pointed	1
behind	1
the	1
snipe	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
fired	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
sure	1
he	1
had	1
missed	1
levin	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
wagonette	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
but	1
in	1
the	1

veslovsky	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
shooting	1
had	1
driven	1
into	1
the	1
marsh	1
and	1
got	1
the	1
horses	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
damn	1
the	1
fellow	1
levin	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
had	1
sunk	1
in	1
the	1
mire	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
drive	1
in	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
dryly	1
and	1
calling	1
the	1
coachman	1
he	1
began	1
pulling	1
the	1
horses	1
out	1
levin	1
was	1
vexed	1
both	1
at	1
being	1
hindered	1
from	1
shooting	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
horses	1
getting	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
neither	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
nor	1
veslovsky	1
helped	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
to	1
unharness	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
get	1
them	1
out	1
since	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
the	1
slightest	1
notion	1
of	1
harnessing	1
without	1
vouchsafing	1
a	1
syllable	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
vassenka	1
s	1
protestations	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
dry	1
there	1
levin	1
worked	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
the	1
coachman	1
at	1
extricating	1
the	1
horses	1
but	1
then	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
warm	1
at	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
saw	1
how	1
assiduously	1
veslovsky	1
was	1
tugging	1
at	1
the	1
wagonette	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mud	1
guards	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
broke	1
it	1
indeed	1
levin	1
blamed	1
himself	1
for	1
having	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
yesterday	1
s	1
feelings	1
been	1
too	1
cold	1
to	1
veslovsky	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
genial	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
his	1
chilliness	1
when	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
right	1
and	1
the	1

had	1
been	1

he	1

levin	1

a	1
little	1
afraid	1
he	1
would	1
exhaust	1
the	1

the	1
chestnut	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
hold	1
in	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
he	1
fell	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
gaiety	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
songs	1
he	1
sang	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
on	1
the	1
box	1

the	1
descriptions	1

representations	1
he	1
gave	1
of	1
driving	1
in	1
the	1
english	1
fashion	1

it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1

drove	1
the	1

so	1
smartly	1
that	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
marsh	1

early	1

it	1
was	1

rid	1
of	1

and	1
be	1
free	1
in	1
his	1
movements	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
evidently	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
desire	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
levin	1
saw	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
anxiety	1
always	1
present	1
in	1
a	1
true	1
sportsman	1
when	1
beginning	1

levin	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
agree	1
and	1
they	1
divided	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
marsh	1
the	1
two	1
dogs	1
began	1
hunting	1
about	1
together	1

made	1
towards	1

in	1
a	1
faint	1
voice	1
to	1
his	1
companion	1
splashing	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
behind	1
him	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1

was	1
pointed	1
after	1
that	1
casual	1
shot	1

the	1

came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
passed	1
each	1
other	1
each	1
pursuing	1
its	1
own	1
scent	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
snipe	1
was	1
so	1
intense	1
that	1
to	1
levin	1
the	1
squelching	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heel	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
it	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mire	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
call	1
of	1
a	1
snipe	1
and	1
he	1
clutched	1
and	1
pressed	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
his	1
gun	1
bang	1
bang	1
sounded	1
almost	1
in	1
his	1
ear	1
vassenka	1
had	1
fired	1
at	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
ducks	1
which	1
was	1
hovering	1
over	1
the	1
marsh	1
and	1
flying	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
towards	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
range	1
before	1
levin	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
whir	1
of	1
one	1
snipe	1
another	1
a	1
third	1
and	1
some	1
eight	1
more	1
rose	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
hit	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
beginning	1
its	1
zigzag	1
movements	1
and	1
the	1
snipe	1
fell	1
in	1
a	1
heap	1
into	1
the	1
mud	1
oblonsky	1
aimed	1
deliberately	1
at	1
another	1
still	1
flying	1
low	1
in	1
the	1
reeds	1
and	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
shot	1
that	1
snipe	1
too	1
fell	1
and	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
fluttering	1
out	1
where	1
the	1
sedge	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
its	1
unhurt	1
wing	1
showing	1
white	1
beneath	1
levin	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
lucky	1
he	1
aimed	1
at	1
his	1
first	1
bird	1
too	1
low	1
and	1
missed	1
he	1
aimed	1
at	1
it	1
again	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
rising	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
another	1
snipe	1
flew	1
up	1
at	1
his	1
very	1
feet	1
distracting	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
missed	1
again	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
loading	1
their	1
guns	1
another	1
snipe	1
rose	1
and	1
veslovsky	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
load	1
again	1
sent	1
two	1
charges	1
of	1
small	1
shot	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
picked	1
up	1
his	1
snipe	1
and	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
levin	1
well	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
separate	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
and	1
limping	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
holding	1
his	1
gun	1
in	1
readiness	1
and	1
whistling	1
to	1
his	1
dog	1
he	1
walked	1
off	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
levin	1
and	1
veslovsky	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
it	1
always	1
happened	1
with	1
levin	1
that	1
when	1
his	1
first	1
shots	1
were	1
a	1
failure	1
he	1
got	1
hot	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
and	1
shot	1
badly	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
snipe	1
showed	1
themselves	1
in	1
numbers	1
they	1
kept	1
flying	1
up	1
from	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
dogs	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
s	1
legs	1
and	1
levin	1
might	1
have	1
retrieved	1
his	1
ill	1
luck	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
shot	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
disgraced	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
veslovsky	1
who	1
kept	1
popping	1
away	1
merrily	1
and	1
indiscriminately	1
killing	1
nothing	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
abashed	1
by	1
his	1
ill	1
success	1
levin	1
in	1
feverish	1
haste	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
himself	1
got	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
and	1
ended	1
by	1
shooting	1
almost	1
without	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
hitting	1
laska	1
indeed	1
seemed	1
to	1
understand	1
this	1
she	1
began	1
looking	1
more	1
languidly	1
and	1
gazed	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
perplexity	1
or	1
reproach	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
shots	1
followed	1
shots	1
in	1
rapid	1
succession	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
powder	1
hung	1
about	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
roomy	1
net	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
bag	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
three	1
light	1
little	1
snipe	1
and	1
of	1
these	1
one	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
by	1
veslovsky	1
alone	1
and	1
one	1
by	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
together	1
meanwhile	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
shots	1
not	1
frequent	1
but	1
as	1
levin	1
fancied	1
well	1
directed	1
for	1
almost	1
after	1
each	1
they	1
heard	1
krak	1
krak	1
apporte	1
this	1
excited	1
levin	1
still	1
more	1
the	1
snipe	1
were	1
floating	1
continually	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
over	1
the	1
reeds	1
their	1
whirring	1
wings	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
their	1
harsh	1
cries	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
the	1
snipe	1
that	1
had	1
risen	1
first	1
and	1
flown	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
settled	1
again	1
before	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
instead	1
of	1
two	1
hawks	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
dozens	1
of	1
them	1
hovering	1
with	1
shrill	1
cries	1
over	1
the	1
marsh	1
after	1
walking	1
through	1
the	1
larger	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
levin	1
and	1
veslovsky	1
reached	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
peasants	1
mowing	1
grass	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
long	1
strips	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
reeds	1
marked	1
off	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
by	1
the	1
trampled	1
grass	1
in	1
another	1
by	1
a	1
path	1
mown	1
through	1
it	1
half	1
of	1
these	1
strips	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
mown	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
hope	1
of	1
finding	1
birds	1
in	1
the	1
uncut	1
part	1
as	1
the	1
cut	1
part	1
levin	1
had	1
promised	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
companion	1
through	1
the	1
cut	1
and	1
uncut	1
patches	1
hi	1
sportsmen	1
shouted	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
peasants	1
sitting	1
on	1
an	1
unharnessed	1
cart	1

have	1
some	1

a	1
good	1
humored	1
looking	1

peasant	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face	1
showing	1
his	1
white	1
teeth	1
in	1
a	1
grin	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
a	1

be	1

by	1
the	1

would	1
go	1

cried	1
levin	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
he	1
perceived	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
veslovsky	1
bent	1
and	1
stumbling	1
with	1
weariness	1
holding	1
his	1
gun	1
out	1
at	1
arm	1
s	1
length	1
was	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
towards	1
the	1
peasants	1
you	1
come	1
too	1
the	1
peasants	1
shouted	1
to	1
levin	1
never	1
fear	1
you	1
taste	1
our	1
cake	1
levin	1
felt	1
a	1
strong	1
inclination	1
to	1
drink	1
a	1
little	1
vodka	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
some	1
bread	1
he	1
was	1
exhausted	1
and	1
felt	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
to	1
drag	1
his	1
staggering	1
legs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mire	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
hesitated	1
but	1
laska	1
was	1
setting	1
and	1
immediately	1
all	1
his	1
weariness	1
vanished	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
lightly	1
through	1
the	1
swamp	1
towards	1
the	1
dog	1
a	1
snipe	1
flew	1
up	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
he	1
fired	1
and	1
killed	1
it	1
laska	1
still	1
pointed	1
fetch	1
it	1
another	1
bird	1
flew	1
up	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
dog	1
levin	1
fired	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
unlucky	1
day	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
missed	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
shot	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
that	1
either	1
he	1
wandered	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
reeds	1
but	1
laska	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
he	1
had	1
shot	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
sent	1
her	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
she	1
pretended	1
to	1
hunt	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
vassenka	1
on	1
whom	1
levin	1
threw	1
the	1
blame	1
of	1
his	1
failure	1
things	1
went	1
no	1
better	1
there	1
were	1
plenty	1
of	1
snipe	1
still	1
but	1
levin	1
made	1
one	1
miss	1
after	1
another	1
the	1
slanting	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
were	1
still	1
hot	1
his	1
clothes	1
soaked	1
through	1
with	1
perspiration	1
stuck	1
to	1
his	1
body	1
his	1
left	1
boot	1
full	1
of	1
water	1
weighed	1
heavily	1
on	1
his	1
leg	1
and	1
squeaked	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
the	1
sweat	1
ran	1
in	1
drops	1
down	1
his	1
powder	1
grimed	1
face	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
bitter	1
taste	1
his	1
nose	1
of	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
powder	1
and	1
stagnant	1
water	1
his	1
ears	1
were	1
ringing	1
with	1
the	1
incessant	1
whir	1
of	1
the	1
snipe	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
touch	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
his	1
gun	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
hot	1
his	1
heart	1
beat	1
with	1
short	1
rapid	1
throbs	1
his	1
hands	1
shook	1
with	1
excitement	1
and	1
his	1
weary	1
legs	1
stumbled	1
and	1
staggered	1
over	1
the	1
hillocks	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
swamp	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
and	1
still	1
he	1
shot	1
at	1
last	1
after	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
miss	1
he	1
flung	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
no	1
i	1
must	1
control	1
myself	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
picking	1
up	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
his	1
hat	1
he	1
called	1
laska	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
swamp	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
on	1
to	1
dry	1
ground	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
pulled	1
off	1
his	1
boot	1
and	1
emptied	1
it	1
then	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
marsh	1
drank	1
some	1
stagnant	1
tasting	1
water	1
moistened	1
his	1
burning	1
hot	1
gun	1
and	1
washed	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
hands	1
feeling	1
refreshed	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
a	1
snipe	1
had	1
settled	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
keep	1
cool	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
again	1
his	1
finger	1
pressed	1
the	1
cock	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
good	1
aim	1
at	1
the	1
bird	1
it	1
got	1
worse	1
and	1
worse	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
five	1
birds	1
in	1
his	1
game	1
bag	1
when	1
he	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
towards	1
the	1
alders	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
rejoin	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
before	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
dog	1
krak	1
darted	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
twisted	1
root	1
of	1
an	1
alder	1
black	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
the	1
stinking	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
conqueror	1
sniffed	1
at	1
laska	1
behind	1
krak	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
view	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
alder	1
tree	1
the	1
shapely	1
figure	1
of	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
red	1
and	1
perspiring	1
with	1
unbuttoned	1
neckband	1
still	1
limping	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
well	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
popping	1
away	1
he	1
said	1

that	1

quite	1

that	1

up	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
antagonistic	1
attitude	1

for	1

consequently	1
considering	1
it	1
with	1
perfect	1

yes	1
you	1
feel	1
it	1
but	1
you	1
don	1

give	1
him	1
your	1
property	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
intentionally	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
provoking	1
levin	1
there	1
had	1
arisen	1
of	1
late	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
secret	1
antagonism	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
brothers	1
in	1
law	1
as	1
though	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
married	1
sisters	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
rivalry	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
between	1
them	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
was	1
ordering	1
his	1
life	1
best	1
and	1
now	1
this	1
hostility	1
showed	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
as	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
personal	1
note	1
i	1
don	1

give	1
it	1
away	1
because	1
no	1

if	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
i	1
could	1
not	1

levin	1

have	1
no	1

to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
give	1

to	1
this	1
peasant	1
he	1

how	1
am	1
i	1
to	1

no	1

i	1

not	1
at	1

on	1

you	1
don	1

sounds	1
were	1
audible	1

bee	1
flew	1
by	1

with	1
the	1
whizzing	1
sound	1
of	1

bullet	1

all	1
flying	1
from	1

thinner	1
in	1
another	1
so	1
that	1
the	1

swayed	1
like	1

in	1
this	1
mist	1
at	1
the	1

in	1

beside	1

forward	1

looking	1
round	1
passing	1
the	1
sleeping	1

reaching	1
the	1

off	1

of	1

sleek	1
dark	1
brown	1

frightened	1
and	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
their	1
hobbled	1
legs	1
and	1
drawing	1
their	1
hoofs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thick	1
mud	1
with	1
a	1
squelching	1
sound	1
they	1
bounded	1
out	1
of	1

ironically	1
at	1
the	1

inquiringly	1
at	1

whistled	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1

joyfully	1
and	1
anxiously	1
through	1
the	1
slush	1
that	1
swayed	1
under	1

running	1
into	1
the	1
marsh	1
among	1
the	1
familiar	1
scents	1
of	1
roots	1
marsh	1
plants	1
and	1
slime	1
and	1
the	1
extraneous	1
smell	1
of	1

laska	1
detected	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
smell	1
that	1
pervaded	1
the	1
whole	1
marsh	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
that	1
strong	1
smelling	1
bird	1
that	1
always	1
excited	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
among	1
the	1
moss	1
and	1
marsh	1
plants	1
this	1
scent	1
was	1
very	1
strong	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
determine	1
in	1
which	1
direction	1
it	1
grew	1
stronger	1
or	1
fainter	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
direction	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
farther	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wind	1
not	1
feeling	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
her	1
legs	1
laska	1
bounded	1
with	1
a	1
stiff	1
gallop	1
so	1
that	1
at	1
each	1
bound	1
she	1
could	1
stop	1
short	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
blew	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
before	1
sunrise	1
and	1
turned	1
facing	1
the	1
wind	1
sniffing	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
dilated	1
nostrils	1
she	1
felt	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
not	1
their	1
tracks	1
only	1
but	1
they	1
themselves	1
were	1
here	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
but	1
many	1
laska	1
slackened	1
her	1
speed	1
they	1
were	1
here	1
but	1
where	1
precisely	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
yet	1
determine	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
very	1
spot	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
circle	1
when	1
suddenly	1
her	1
master	1
s	1
voice	1
drew	1
her	1
off	1
laska	1
here	1
he	1
asked	1
pointing	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
different	1
direction	1
she	1
stopped	1
asking	1
him	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
doing	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
begun	1
but	1
he	1
repeated	1
his	1
command	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
voice	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
spot	1
covered	1
with	1
water	1
where	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
anything	1
she	1
obeyed	1
him	1
pretending	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
please	1
him	1
went	1
round	1
it	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
former	1
position	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
scent	1
again	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
hindering	1
her	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
under	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
vexation	1
stumbling	1
over	1
a	1
high	1
stump	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
but	1
righting	1
herself	1
with	1
her	1
strong	1
supple	1
legs	1
she	1
began	1
making	1
the	1
circle	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
clear	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
them	1
reached	1
her	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
defined	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
became	1
perfectly	1
clear	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
here	1
behind	1
this	1
tuft	1
of	1
reeds	1
five	1
paces	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
she	1
stopped	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
body	1
was	1
still	1
and	1
rigid	1
on	1
her	1
short	1
legs	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
scent	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
sitting	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
paces	1
off	1
she	1
stood	1
still	1
feeling	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
conscious	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
enjoying	1
it	1
in	1
anticipation	1
her	1
tail	1
was	1
stretched	1
straight	1
and	1
tense	1
and	1
only	1
wagging	1
at	1
the	1
extreme	1
end	1
her	1
mouth	1
was	1
slightly	1
open	1
her	1
ears	1
raised	1
one	1
ear	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
wrong	1
side	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
up	1
and	1
she	1
breathed	1
heavily	1
but	1
warily	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
warily	1
looked	1
round	1
but	1
more	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
than	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
her	1
master	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
face	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
though	1
the	1
eyes	1
were	1
always	1
terrible	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
stumbled	1
over	1
the	1
stump	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
moved	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
extraordinarily	1
slowly	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
came	1
slowly	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
noticing	1
laska	1
s	1
special	1
attitude	1
as	1
she	1
crouched	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
scratching	1
big	1
prints	1
with	1
her	1
hind	1
paws	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
mouth	1
slightly	1
open	1
levin	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
pointing	1
at	1
grouse	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
inward	1
prayer	1
for	1
luck	1
especially	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
bird	1
he	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
coming	1
quite	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
could	1
from	1
his	1
height	1
look	1
beyond	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
seeing	1
with	1
her	1
nose	1
in	1
a	1
space	1
between	1
two	1
little	1
thickets	1
at	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
yards	1
distance	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
grouse	1
turning	1
its	1
head	1
it	1
was	1
listening	1
then	1
lightly	1
preening	1
and	1
folding	1
its	1
wings	1
it	1
disappeared	1
round	1
a	1
corner	1
with	1
a	1
clumsy	1
wag	1
of	1
its	1
tail	1
fetch	1
it	1
fetch	1
it	1
shouted	1
levin	1
giving	1
laska	1
a	1
shove	1
from	1
behind	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
go	1

laska	1

if	1

i	1
shall	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
or	1
who	1
they	1
are	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
shoved	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
knee	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
excited	1
whisper	1
said	1
fetch	1
it	1
laska	1
well	1
if	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
he	1
wishes	1
i	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
answer	1
for	1
myself	1
now	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
darted	1
forward	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
her	1
legs	1
would	1
carry	1
her	1
between	1
the	1
thick	1
bushes	1
she	1
scented	1
nothing	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
without	1
understanding	1
anything	1
ten	1
paces	1
from	1
her	1
former	1
place	1
a	1
grouse	1
rose	1
with	1
a	1
guttural	1
cry	1
and	1
the	1
peculiar	1
round	1
sound	1
of	1
its	1
wings	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
shot	1
it	1
splashed	1
heavily	1
with	1
its	1
white	1
breast	1
on	1
the	1
wet	1
mire	1
another	1
bird	1
did	1
not	1
linger	1

rose	1
behind	1

the	1

when	1
levin	1
turned	1
towards	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
some	1

off	1
but	1
his	1
shot	1
caught	1
it	1
flying	1
twenty	1
paces	1
further	1
the	1
second	1
grouse	1
rose	1
upwards	1
and	1
whirling	1
round	1
like	1
a	1
ball	1
dropped	1
heavily	1
on	1

fully	1

the	1

on	1

the	1

for	1
the	1

destroyed	1
his	1

humor	1
though	1
later	1
he	1
laughed	1
at	1
it	1
a	1

deal	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1

hungry	1
from	1

levin	1
had	1
so	1
distinct	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
meat	1
pies	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
hut	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
smell	1
and	1
taste	1
them	1
as	1
laska	1
had	1
smelt	1
the	1
game	1
and	1
he	1
immediately	1
told	1
philip	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1

the	1
beef	1

the	1
bones	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
dogs	1
answered	1
philip	1
levin	1
was	1
so	1
hurt	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
vexation	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
something	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
then	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
game	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
shaking	1
voice	1
to	1
philip	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
vassenka	1
and	1
cover	1
them	1
with	1
some	1
nettles	1
and	1
you	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
ask	1
for	1
some	1
milk	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
some	1
milk	1
he	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
immediately	1
at	1
having	1
shown	1
his	1
annoyance	1
to	1
a	1
stranger	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
his	1
hungry	1
mortification	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
they	1
went	1
shooting	1
again	1
and	1
veslovsky	1
had	1
several	1
successful	1
shots	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
they	1
drove	1
home	1
their	1
homeward	1
journey	1
was	1

with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
we	1
had	1
splendid	1
shooting	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
delightful	1
experiences	1
said	1
veslovsky	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
kitty	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
samovar	1
what	1
a	1
pity	1
ladies	1
are	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
these	1
delights	1
well	1
i	1
suppose	1
he	1
must	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
levin	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
again	1
he	1
fancied	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
smile	1
in	1
the	1
all	1
conquering	1
air	1
with	1
which	1
their	1
guest	1
addressed	1
kitty	1
the	1
princess	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
marya	1
vlasyevna	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
called	1
levin	1
to	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
moving	1
to	1
moscow	1
for	1
kitty	1
s	1
confinement	1
and	1
getting	1
ready	1
rooms	1
for	1
them	1
just	1
as	1
levin	1
had	1
disliked	1
all	1
the	1
trivial	1
preparations	1
for	1
his	1
wedding	1
as	1
derogatory	1
to	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
still	1
more	1
offensive	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
approaching	1
birth	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
reckoned	1
it	1
seemed	1
on	1
their	1
fingers	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
turn	1
a	1
deaf	1
ear	1
to	1
these	1
discussions	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
patterns	1
of	1
long	1
clothes	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
baby	1
tried	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
and	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
the	1
mysterious	1
endless	1
strips	1
of	1
knitting	1
the	1
triangles	1
of	1
linen	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
to	1
which	1
dolly	1
attached	1
special	1
importance	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
a	1
son	1
he	1
was	1
certain	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
son	1
which	1
was	1
promised	1
him	1
but	1
which	1
he	1
still	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
so	1
marvelous	1
it	1
seemed	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
on	1
one	1
hand	1
as	1
a	1
happiness	1
so	1
immense	1
and	1
therefore	1
so	1
incredible	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
an	1
event	1
so	1
mysterious	1
that	1
this	1
assumption	1
of	1
a	1
definite	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
and	1
consequent	1
preparation	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
for	1
something	1
ordinary	1
that	1
did	1
happen	1
to	1
people	1
jarred	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
confusing	1
and	1
humiliating	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
his	1
feelings	1
and	1
put	1
down	1
his	1
reluctance	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
to	1
carelessness	1
and	1
indifference	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
peace	1
she	1
had	1
commissioned	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
flat	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
called	1
levin	1
up	1
i	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
princess	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
fit	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
must	1
decide	1
when	1
you	1
will	1
move	1
i	1
really	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
i	1
know	1
millions	1
of	1
children	1
are	1
born	1
away	1
from	1
moscow	1
and	1
doctors	1
why	1
but	1
if	1
so	1
oh	1
no	1
as	1
kitty	1
wishes	1
we	1
can	1
t	1
talk	1
to	1
kitty	1
about	1
it	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
frighten	1
her	1
why	1
this	1
spring	1
natalia	1
golitzina	1
died	1
from	1
having	1
an	1
ignorant	1
doctor	1
i	1
will	1
do	1
just	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
he	1
said	1
gloomily	1
the	1
princess	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
though	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
indeed	1
jarred	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
gloomy	1
not	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
that	1
conversation	1
but	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
samovar	1
no	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
he	1
thought	1
glancing	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
vassenka	1
bending	1
over	1
kitty	1
telling	1
her	1
something	1
with	1
his	1
charming	1
smile	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
flushed	1
and	1
disturbed	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
nice	1
in	1
vassenka	1
s	1
attitude	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
his	1
smile	1
levin	1
even	1
saw	1
something	1
not	1
nice	1
in	1
kitty	1
s	1
attitude	1
and	1
look	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
light	1
died	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
again	1
as	1
before	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
transition	1
he	1
felt	1
cast	1
down	1
from	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
happiness	1
peace	1
and	1
dignity	1
into	1
an	1
abyss	1
of	1
despair	1
rage	1
and	1
humiliation	1
again	1
everything	1
and	1
everyone	1
had	1
become	1
hateful	1
to	1
him	1
you	1
do	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
best	1
princess	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
looking	1
round	1
heavy	1
is	1
the	1
cap	1
of	1
monomach	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
said	1
playfully	1
hinting	1
evidently	1
not	1
simply	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
conversation	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
agitation	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
how	1
late	1
you	1
are	1
today	1
dolly	1
everyone	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
greet	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
vassenka	1
only	1
rose	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
courtesy	1
to	1
ladies	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
scarcely	1
bowed	1
and	1
resumed	1
his	1
conversation	1
again	1
laughing	1
at	1
something	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
worried	1
about	1
masha	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
well	1
and	1
is	1
dreadfully	1
tiresome	1
today	1
said	1
dolly	1
the	1
conversation	1
vassenka	1
had	1
started	1
with	1
kitty	1
was	1
running	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
lines	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
discussing	1
anna	1
and	1
whether	1
love	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
higher	1
than	1
worldly	1
considerations	1
kitty	1
disliked	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
disturbed	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
the	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
conducted	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
simple	1
and	1
innocent	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
cut	1
short	1
this	1
conversation	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
conceal	1
the	1
superficial	1
pleasure	1
afforded	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
s	1
very	1
obvious	1
admiration	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
stop	1
it	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
whatever	1
she	1
did	1
she	1
knew	1
would	1
be	1
observed	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
the	1
worst	1
interpretation	1
put	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
dolly	1
what	1
was	1
wrong	1
with	1
masha	1
and	1
vassenka	1
waiting	1
till	1
this	1
uninteresting	1
conversation	1
was	1
over	1
began	1
to	1
gaze	1
indifferently	1
at	1
dolly	1
the	1
question	1
struck	1
levin	1
as	1
an	1
unnatural	1
and	1
disgusting	1
piece	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
mushrooms	1
today	1
said	1
dolly	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
please	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
come	1
too	1
said	1
kitty	1
and	1
she	1
blushed	1
she	1
wanted	1
from	1
politeness	1
to	1
ask	1
vassenka	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
kostya	1
she	1
asked	1
her	1
husband	1
with	1
a	1
guilty	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
resolute	1
step	1
this	1
guilty	1
air	1
confirmed	1
all	1
his	1
suspicions	1
the	1
mechanician	1
came	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
away	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
seen	1
him	1
yet	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
went	1
downstairs	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
study	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
familiar	1
footsteps	1
running	1
with	1
reckless	1
speed	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
shortly	1
we	1
are	1
busy	1
i	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
german	1
mechanician	1
i	1
want	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
with	1
my	1
husband	1
the	1
german	1
would	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
but	1
levin	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
don	1
t	1
disturb	1
yourself	1
the	1
train	1
is	1
at	1
three	1
queried	1
the	1
german	1
i	1
mustn	1
t	1
be	1
late	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
him	1
but	1
walked	1
out	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
well	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
french	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
in	1
her	1
condition	1
was	1
trembling	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
piteous	1
crushed	1
look	1
i	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
misery	1
she	1
said	1
the	1
servants	1
are	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
sideboard	1
he	1
said	1
angrily	1
don	1
t	1
make	1
a	1
scene	1
well	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
in	1
here	1
they	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
kitty	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
but	1
there	1
the	1
english	1
governess	1
was	1
giving	1
tanya	1
a	1
lesson	1
well	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
peasant	1
weeding	1
the	1
path	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
considering	1
that	1
the	1
peasant	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
tear	1
stained	1
and	1
his	1
agitated	1
face	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
like	1
people	1
fleeing	1
from	1
some	1
disaster	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
feeling	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
speak	1
out	1
and	1
clear	1
up	1
misunderstandings	1
must	1
be	1
alone	1
together	1
and	1
so	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
misery	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
feeling	1
we	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
it	1
s	1
misery	1
i	1
am	1
wretched	1
you	1
are	1
wretched	1
what	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
reached	1
a	1
solitary	1
garden	1
seat	1
at	1
a	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
lime	1
tree	1
avenue	1
but	1
tell	1
me	1
one	1
thing	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
his	1
tone	1
anything	1
unseemly	1
not	1
nice	1
humiliatingly	1
horrible	1
he	1
said	1
standing	1
before	1
her	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
with	1
his	1
clenched	1
fists	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
stood	1
before	1
her	1
that	1
night	1
yes	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
shaking	1
voice	1
but	1
kostya	1
surely	1
you	1
see	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
tone	1
but	1
such	1
people	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
come	1
how	1
happy	1
we	1
were	1
she	1
said	1
breathless	1
with	1
the	1
sobs	1
that	1
shook	1
her	1
although	1
nothing	1
had	1
been	1

upon	1

at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
having	1
unpacked	1
his	1
things	1
from	1
his	1
trunk	1
and	1
laid	1
out	1
some	1
new	1
songs	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
gaiters	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
riding	1
whether	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
exceptional	1
in	1

out	1
of	1

in	1
this	1

but	1
he	1
was	1
somewhat	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
society	1
can	1
be	1
disconcerted	1
at	1
levin	1
s	1
entrance	1

vassenka	1
putting	1
his	1
fat	1
leg	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
fastening	1
the	1
bottom	1
hook	1
and	1
smiling	1
with	1
simple	1
hearted	1
good	1
humor	1
he	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
fellow	1
and	1
levin	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
ashamed	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
his	1
host	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
shy	1
look	1
on	1
vassenka	1
s	1
face	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
lay	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
stick	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
broken	1
together	1
that	1
morning	1
trying	1
their	1
strength	1
levin	1
took	1
the	1
fragment	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
began	1
smashing	1
it	1
up	1
breaking	1
bits	1
off	1
the	1
stick	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
begin	1
i	1
wanted	1
he	1
paused	1
but	1
suddenly	1
remembering	1
kitty	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
him	1
resolutely	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
i	1
have	1
ordered	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
for	1
you	1
how	1
so	1
vassenka	1
began	1
in	1
surprise	1
to	1
drive	1
where	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
levin	1
said	1
gloomily	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
away	1
or	1
has	1
something	1
happened	1
it	1
happens	1
that	1
i	1
expect	1

said	1
levin	1
his	1
strong	1
fingers	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rapidly	1
breaking	1
off	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
split	1
stick	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
expecting	1
visitors	1
and	1
nothing	1
has	1
happened	1
but	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
you	1
can	1
explain	1
my	1
rudeness	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
vassenka	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
explain	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
dignity	1
understanding	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
explain	1
levin	1
said	1
softly	1
and	1
deliberately	1
trying	1
to	1
control	1
the	1
trembling	1
of	1
his	1
jaw	1
and	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
not	1
ask	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
split	1
ends	1
were	1
all	1
broken	1
off	1
levin	1
clutched	1
the	1
thick	1
ends	1
in	1
his	1
finger	1
broke	1
the	1
stick	1
in	1
two	1
and	1
carefully	1
caught	1
the	1
end	1
as	1
it	1
fell	1
probably	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
those	1
nervous	1
fingers	1
of	1
the	1
muscles	1
he	1
had	1
proved	1
that	1
morning	1
at	1
gymnastics	1
of	1
the	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
the	1
soft	1
voice	1
and	1
quivering	1
jaws	1
convinced	1
vassenka	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
words	1
he	1
bowed	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
smiling	1
contemptuously	1
can	1
i	1
not	1
see	1
oblonsky	1
the	1
shrug	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
did	1
not	1
irritate	1
levin	1
what	1
else	1
was	1
there	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1

thought	1

turned	1
out	1

for	1

turned	1
pale	1
again	1
when	1

arkadyevitch	1
would	1
have	1
enlarged	1
on	1
the	1

turned	1
quickly	1
and	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
alone	1
soon	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
saw	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
trees	1
how	1
vassenka	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
hay	1
unluckily	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
trap	1
in	1
his	1
scotch	1
cap	1
was	1
driven	1
along	1
the	1
avenue	1
jolting	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
ruts	1
what	1
s	1
this	1
levin	1
thought	1
when	1
a	1
footman	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
stopped	1
the	1
trap	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
mechanician	1
whom	1
levin	1
had	1
totally	1
forgotten	1
the	1
mechanician	1
bowing	1
low	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
veslovsky	1
then	1
clambered	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
they	1
drove	1
off	1
together	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
were	1
much	1
upset	1
by	1
levin	1
s	1
action	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
felt	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
ridicule	1
but	1
also	1
utterly	1
guilty	1
and	1
disgraced	1
but	1
remembering	1
what	1
sufferings	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
been	1
through	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
how	1
he	1
should	1
act	1
another	1
time	1
he	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
again	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
everyone	1
except	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
pardon	1
levin	1
s	1
action	1
became	1
extraordinarily	1
lively	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
like	1
children	1
after	1
a	1
punishment	1
or	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
after	1
a	1
dreary	1
ceremonious	1
reception	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
vassenka	1
s	1
dismissal	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
some	1
remote	1
event	1
and	1
dolly	1
who	1
had	1
inherited	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
gift	1
of	1
humorous	1
storytelling	1
made	1
varenka	1
helpless	1
with	1
laughter	1
as	1
she	1
related	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
time	1
always	1
with	1
fresh	1
humorous	1
additions	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
just	1

out	1

went	1
to	1

anna	1
she	1
was	1
sorry	1
to	1
annoy	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
levin	1
disliked	1
she	1
quite	1
understood	1
how	1
right	1
the	1
levins	1
were	1
in	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
vronsky	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
anna	1
and	1
show	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
feelings	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
changed	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
independent	1
of	1

to	1
the	1
village	1
to	1

horses	1
for	1
the	1
drive	1
but	1
levin	1
learning	1
of	1
it	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
protest	1
what	1
makes	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
i	1
dislike	1
your	1
going	1
but	1
even	1
if	1

it	1
i	1
should	1
still	1
more	1
dislike	1
your	1
not	1

that	1
you	1

for	1
certain	1
hiring	1
horses	1

the	1

had	1
to	1
consent	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
levin	1
had	1
ready	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
four	1
horses	1
and	1
relays	1
getting	1
them	1
together	1
from	1
the	1
farm	1
and	1
saddle	1
horses	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
smart	1
looking	1
set	1
but	1
capable	1
of	1
taking	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
the	1
whole	1
distance	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
day	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
when	1
horses	1
were	1
wanted	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
midwife	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
difficult	1
matter	1
for	1
levin	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
number	1
but	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
hospitality	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
allow	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
to	1
hire	1
horses	1
when	1
staying	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
moreover	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
twenty	1
roubles	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
asked	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
were	1
a	1
serious	1
matter	1
for	1
her	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
pecuniary	1
affairs	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
unsatisfactory	1
state	1
were	1
taken	1
to	1
heart	1
by	1
the	1
levins	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
their	1
own	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
by	1
levin	1
s	1
advice	1
started	1
before	1
daybreak	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
good	1
the	1
carriage	1
comfortable	1
the	1
horses	1
trotted	1
along	1
merrily	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
besides	1
the	1
coachman	1
sat	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
whom	1
levin	1
was	1
sending	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
groom	1
for	1
greater	1
security	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
dozed	1
and	1
waked	1
up	1
only	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
inn	1
where	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
changed	1
after	1
drinking	1
tea	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
well	1
to	1
do	1
peasant	1

with	1
whom	1
levin	1
had	1
stayed	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
and	1
chatting	1
with	1
the	1
women	1
about	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
about	1
count	1
vronsky	1
whom	1
the	1
latter	1
praised	1
very	1
highly	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
at	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
went	1
on	1
again	1
at	1
home	1
looking	1
after	1
her	1
children	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
so	1
now	1
after	1
this	1
journey	1
of	1
four	1
hours	1
all	1
the	1
thoughts	1
she	1
had	1
suppressed	1
before	1
rushed	1
swarming	1
into	1
her	1
brain	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
over	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
as	1
she	1
never	1
had	1
before	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
different	1
points	1
of	1
view	1
her	1
thoughts	1
seemed	1
strange	1
even	1
to	1
herself	1
at	1
first	1
she	1
thought	1
about	1
the	1
children	1
about	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
uneasy	1
although	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
kitty	1
she	1
reckoned	1
more	1
upon	1
her	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
them	1
if	1
only	1
masha	1
does	1
not	1
begin	1
her	1
naughty	1
tricks	1
if	1
grisha	1
isn	1
t	1
kicked	1
by	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
lily	1
s	1
stomach	1
isn	1
t	1
upset	1
again	1
she	1
thought	1
but	1
these	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
were	1
succeeded	1
by	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
immediate	1
future	1
she	1
began	1
thinking	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
new	1
flat	1
in	1
moscow	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
winter	1
to	1
renew	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
furniture	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
elder	1
girl	1
a	1
cloak	1
then	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
remote	1
future	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
place	1
her	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
girls	1
are	1
all	1
right	1
she	1
thought	1
but	1
the	1
boys	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
teaching	1
grisha	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
s	1
only	1
because	1
i	1
am	1
free	1
myself	1
now	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
with	1
child	1
stiva	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
counting	1
on	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
good	1
natured	1
friends	1
i	1
can	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
s	1
another	1
baby	1
coming	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
struck	1
her	1
how	1
untruly	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
curse	1
laid	1
on	1
woman	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
sorrow	1
she	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
children	1
the	1
birth	1
itself	1
that	1
s	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
months	1
of	1
carrying	1
the	1
child	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
s	1
so	1
intolerable	1
she	1
thought	1
picturing	1
to	1
herself	1
her	1
last	1
pregnancy	1
and	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
baby	1
and	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
had	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
at	1
the	1
inn	1
on	1
being	1
asked	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
any	1
children	1
the	1
handsome	1
young	1
woman	1
had	1
answered	1
cheerfully	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
girl	1
baby	1
but	1
god	1
set	1
me	1
free	1
i	1
buried	1
her	1
last	1
lent	1
well	1
did	1
you	1
grieve	1
very	1
much	1
for	1
her	1
asked	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
why	1
grieve	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
has	1
grandchildren	1
enough	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
trouble	1
no	1
working	1
nor	1
nothing	1
only	1
a	1
tie	1
this	1
answer	1
had	1
struck	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
as	1
revolting	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
natured	1
and	1
pleasing	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
recalling	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
those	1
cynical	1
words	1
there	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
truth	1
yes	1
altogether	1
thought	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
looking	1
back	1
over	1
her	1
whole	1
existence	1
during	1
those	1
fifteen	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
married	1
life	1
pregnancy	1
sickness	1
mental	1
incapacity	1
indifference	1
to	1
everything	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
hideousness	1
kitty	1
young	1
and	1
pretty	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
even	1
kitty	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
looks	1
and	1
i	1
when	1
i	1
m	1
with	1
child	1
become	1
hideous	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
the	1
birth	1
the	1
agony	1
the	1
hideous	1
agonies	1
that	1
last	1
moment	1
then	1
the	1
nursing	1
the	1
sleepless	1
nights	1
the	1
fearful	1
pains	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
from	1
sore	1
breasts	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
with	1
almost	1
every	1
child	1
then	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
illnesses	1
that	1
everlasting	1
apprehension	1
then	1
bringing	1
them	1
up	1
evil	1
propensities	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
little	1
masha	1
s	1
crime	1
among	1
the	1
raspberries	1
education	1
latin	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
so	1
incomprehensible	1
and	1
difficult	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
these	1
children	1
and	1
there	1
rose	1
again	1
before	1
her	1
imagination	1
the	1
cruel	1
memory	1
that	1
always	1
tore	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
her	1
last	1
little	1
baby	1
who	1
had	1
died	1
of	1
croup	1
his	1
funeral	1
the	1
callous	1
indifference	1
of	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
pink	1
coffin	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
torn	1
heart	1
and	1
her	1
lonely	1
anguish	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
pale	1
little	1
brow	1
with	1
its	1
projecting	1
temples	1
and	1
the	1
open	1
wondering	1
little	1
mouth	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
being	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
pink	1
lid	1
with	1
a	1
cross	1
braided	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
what	1
s	1
it	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
that	1
i	1

wasting	1
my	1

either	1
with	1

or	1
nursing	1
a	1
child	1
forever	1
irritable	1
peevish	1
wretched	1
myself	1
and	1
worrying	1

repulsive	1
to	1
my	1

while	1
the	1

are	1
growing	1
up	1
unhappy	1
badly	1

hard	1
with	1
the	1

of	1
other	1
people	1
at	1

again	1
she	1
recalled	1
what	1
the	1
young	1
peasant	1
woman	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
was	1
revolted	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
admitting	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
brutal	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
is	1
it	1
far	1
now	1
mihail	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
asked	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
mind	1
from	1
thoughts	1
that	1
were	1
frightening	1
her	1
from	1
this	1
village	1

say	1
it	1
s	1
five	1
miles	1
the	1

drove	1
along	1
the	1
village	1

and	1
onto	1
a	1
bridge	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
was	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
peasant	1
women	1
with	1
coils	1
of	1
ties	1
for	1
the	1
sheaves	1
on	1
their	1
shoulders	1
gaily	1
and	1
noisily	1
chattering	1
they	1
stood	1
still	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
staring	1
inquisitively	1
at	1
the	1
carriage	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
turned	1
to	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
looked	1
to	1
her	1
healthy	1

happy	1
making	1
her	1
envious	1
of	1

still	1
mused	1
when	1

passed	1
the	1

uphill	1
again	1
at	1

on	1

darya	1
alexandrovna	1
pursued	1
her	1

in	1
the	1

she	1
had	1
a	1
traveling	1

glass	1
in	1

she	1
wanted	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
out	1

looking	1
at	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
coachman	1
and	1
the	1
swaying	1
counting	1

she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
ashamed	1
if	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
out	1
the	1
glass	1
but	1
without	1
looking	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
even	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
sergey	1

always	1
particularly	1
attentive	1
to	1
her	1
of	1

her	1
nurse	1
her	1
children	1
through	1
the	1
scarlatina	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1

there	1
was	1
someone	1
else	1
a	1
quite	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
joke	1
thought	1
her	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
her	1

and	1
impossible	1

before	1

did	1
quite	1
right	1
and	1
certainly	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
reproach	1
her	1
for	1
it	1
she	1
is	1
happy	1
she	1
makes	1
another	1
person	1
happy	1
and	1
she	1
s	1
not	1
broken	1
down	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
but	1
most	1
likely	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
was	1
bright	1
clever	1
open	1
to	1
every	1
impression	1

and	1
a	1
sly	1

on	1

the	1

the	1

of	1

at	1

up	1

looked	1
round	1
to	1

just	1
going	1

down	1

on	1

shouted	1
peremptorily	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
instead	1
and	1
beckoned	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
up	1

wind	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
blow	1
as	1

when	1

stood	1

on	1

off	1

dark	1
with	1

the	1

shifting	1
from	1
one	1

to	1
the	1

leaving	1
a	1

in	1

round	1

called	1
to	1
a	1
lad	1
who	1
was	1
shouting	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1

the	1

unmistakably	1
loth	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
travelers	1
go	1
and	1
eager	1
to	1
converse	1
the	1
coachman	1
started	1
the	1
horses	1

they	1

only	1
just	1

off	1

the	1
conception	1
of	1
riding	1
on	1
horseback	1
for	1
a	1
lady	1
was	1
in	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
mind	1
associated	1
with	1
ideas	1
of	1
youthful	1
flirtation	1
and	1
frivolity	1
which	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
was	1
unbecoming	1

position	1
but	1
when	1
she	1

scrutinized	1
her	1
seeing	1
her	1
closer	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
reconciled	1
to	1
her	1
riding	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
elegance	1
everything	1
was	1
so	1
simple	1
quiet	1

dignified	1
in	1
the	1
attitude	1

dress	1

at	1

taking	1
dolly	1

she	1
drew	1
her	1
away	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
fairly	1
dazzled	1
by	1
the	1
elegant	1
carriage	1
of	1
a	1
pattern	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
the	1
splendid	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
elegant	1
and	1
gorgeous	1
people	1
surrounding	1
her	1
but	1
what	1
struck	1
her	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
change	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
anna	1
whom	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
loved	1
any	1
other	1
woman	1
a	1
less	1
close	1
observer	1
not	1
knowing	1
anna	1
before	1
or	1
not	1
having	1
thought	1
as	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
noticed	1
anything	1
special	1
in	1
anna	1
but	1
now	1
dolly	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
that	1
temporary	1
beauty	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
found	1
in	1
women	1
during	1
the	1
moments	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
which	1
she	1
saw	1
now	1
in	1
anna	1
s	1
face	1
everything	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
the	1
clearly	1
marked	1
dimples	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks	1
and	1
chin	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
the	1
smile	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
fluttered	1
about	1
her	1
face	1
the	1
brilliance	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
the	1
grace	1
and	1
rapidity	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
notes	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
even	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
angry	1
friendliness	1
she	1
answered	1
veslovsky	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
permission	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
her	1
cob	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
teach	1
it	1
to	1
gallop	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
leg	1
foremost	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
peculiarly	1
fascinating	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
herself	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
it	1
when	1
both	1
the	1
women	1
were	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
a	1
sudden	1
embarrassment	1
came	1
over	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
anna	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
the	1
intent	1
look	1
of	1
inquiry	1
dolly	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her	1
dolly	1
was	1
embarrassed	1
because	1
after	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
phrase	1
about	1
this	1
vehicle	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
dirty	1
old	1
carriage	1
in	1
which	1
anna	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
coachman	1
philip	1
and	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
were	1
experiencing	1
the	1
same	1
sensation	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
confusion	1
busied	1
himself	1
settling	1
the	1
ladies	1
but	1
philip	1
the	1
coachman	1
became	1
sullen	1
and	1
was	1
bracing	1
himself	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overawed	1
in	1
future	1
by	1
this	1
external	1
superiority	1
he	1
smiled	1
ironically	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
raven	1
horse	1
and	1
was	1
already	1
deciding	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
this	1
smart	1
trotter	1
in	1
the	1
char	1
à	1

was	1
only	1
good	1
for	1

and	1
wouldn	1

the	1
peasants	1
had	1
all	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
were	1
inquisitively	1
and	1
mirthfully	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1

making	1
their	1

looked	1
at	1
dolly	1
s	1
thin	1
care	1
worn	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
wrinkles	1
filled	1
with	1
dust	1
from	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
saying	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
dolly	1
had	1
got	1
thinner	1
but	1
conscious	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
grown	1
handsomer	1
and	1
that	1
dolly	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
telling	1
her	1
so	1
she	1
sighed	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
herself	1
you	1
are	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
wondering	1
how	1
i	1
can	1
be	1
happy	1
in	1
my	1
position	1
well	1
it	1
s	1
shameful	1
to	1
confess	1
but	1
i	1
i	1
m	1
inexcusably	1
happy	1
something	1
magical	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
when	1
you	1
re	1
frightened	1
panic	1
stricken	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
you	1
wake	1
up	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
horrors	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
i	1
have	1
waked	1
up	1
i	1
have	1
lived	1
through	1
the	1
misery	1
the	1
dread	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
past	1
especially	1
since	1
we	1
ve	1
been	1
here	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
so	1
happy	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
smile	1
of	1
inquiry	1
looking	1
at	1
dolly	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
said	1
dolly	1
smiling	1
involuntarily	1
speaking	1
more	1
coldly	1
than	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
for	1
you	1
why	1
haven	1
t	1
you	1
written	1
to	1

because	1
i	1

the	1
courage	1
you	1

my	1

the	1
courage	1
if	1
you	1
knew	1
how	1

at	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
wanted	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
but	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
but	1
of	1
that	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
later	1
what	1
s	1
this	1
what	1
are	1
all	1
these	1
buildings	1
she	1
asked	1
wanting	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
red	1
and	1
green	1
roofs	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
view	1
behind	1
the	1
green	1
hedges	1
of	1
acacia	1
and	1
lilac	1
quite	1
a	1
little	1
town	1
but	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
no	1
no	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
position	1
what	1

think	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
asked	1
i	1
consider	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
cob	1
to	1
gallop	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
leg	1
foremost	1
galloped	1
past	1
them	1
bumping	1
heavily	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
short	1
jacket	1
on	1
the	1
chamois	1
leather	1
of	1
the	1
side	1
saddle	1
he	1
s	1
doing	1
it	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
he	1
shouted	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
glance	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
again	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
cut	1
short	1
her	1
thought	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
anything	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
i	1
always	1
loved	1
you	1
and	1
if	1
one	1
loves	1
anyone	1
one	1
loves	1
the	1
whole	1
person	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
one	1
would	1
like	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
anna	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
friend	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyelids	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
habit	1
dolly	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
before	1
pondered	1
trying	1
to	1
penetrate	1
the	1
full	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
obviously	1
interpreting	1
them	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
wished	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
dolly	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
any	1
sins	1
she	1
said	1
they	1
would	1
all	1
be	1
forgiven	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
dolly	1
saw	1
that	1
tears	1
stood	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
she	1
pressed	1
anna	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
silence	1
well	1
what	1
are	1
these	1
buildings	1
how	1
many	1
there	1
are	1
of	1
them	1
after	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
silence	1
she	1
repeated	1
her	1
question	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
houses	1
barns	1
and	1
stables	1
answered	1
anna	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
park	1
begins	1
it	1
had	1
all	1
gone	1
to	1
ruin	1
but	1
alexey	1
had	1
everything	1
renewed	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
and	1
what	1
i	1
never	1
expected	1
he	1
has	1
become	1
intensely	1
interested	1
in	1
looking	1
after	1
it	1
but	1
his	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
rich	1
nature	1
whatever	1
he	1
takes	1
up	1
he	1
does	1
splendidly	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
bored	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
works	1
with	1
passionate	1
interest	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
temperament	1
as	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
become	1
careful	1
and	1
businesslike	1
a	1
first	1
rate	1
manager	1
he	1
positively	1
reckons	1
every	1
penny	1
in	1
his	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
but	1
only	1
in	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
money	1
she	1
spoke	1
with	1
that	1
gleefully	1
sly	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
women	1
often	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
secret	1
characteristics	1
only	1
known	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
those	1
they	1
love	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
big	1
building	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
new	1
hospital	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
will	1
cost	1
over	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1

s	1
his	1
hobby	1
just	1
now	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
about	1
the	1
peasants	1
asked	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
meadowland	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
cheaper	1
rate	1
and	1
he	1
refused	1
and	1
i	1
accused	1
him	1
of	1
being	1
miserly	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
but	1
everything	1
together	1
he	1
began	1
this	1
hospital	1
to	1
prove	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
miserly	1
about	1
money	1
c	1
est	1

if	1

more	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
now	1

a	1
moment	1

was	1
his	1
grandfather	1

house	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
nothing	1

courtyard	1
strewn	1
with	1
gravel	1

bright	1
with	1
flowers	1
in	1
which	1
two	1

all	1

her	1
an	1

obviously	1
much	1
pleased	1
at	1
that	1

and	1
began	1
to	1
chatter	1
away	1
without	1
a	1
pause	1
dolly	1
observed	1
that	1

longing	1
to	1

her	1

her	1

put	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
simple	1
batiste	1

dolly	1
scrutinized	1
that	1
simple	1
gown	1
attentively	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
and	1
the	1
price	1
at	1
which	1
such	1
simplicity	1
was	1
obtained	1

not	1
embarrassed	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
composed	1
and	1
at	1
ease	1
dolly	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
completely	1
recovered	1
from	1
the	1
impression	1
her	1
arrival	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
had	1
assumed	1
that	1
superficial	1
careless	1
tone	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
that	1
compartment	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
deeper	1

were	1
kept	1
well	1
anna	1

an	1
italian	1
wet	1

a	1
good	1
creature	1
but	1
so	1
stupid	1

the	1

so	1
used	1
to	1
her	1

how	1

beginning	1
a	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
name	1

would	1
have	1
but	1
noticing	1
a	1
sudden	1
frown	1
on	1
anna	1

face	1
she	1
changed	1
the	1
drift	1
of	1
her	1
question	1

crawls	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
the	1
luxury	1
which	1
had	1
impressed	1
dolly	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
struck	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
there	1
were	1
little	1
go	1
carts	1
ordered	1
from	1
england	1
and	1
appliances	1
for	1
learning	1
to	1
walk	1
and	1
a	1
sofa	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
a	1
billiard	1
table	1
purposely	1
constructed	1
for	1
crawling	1
and	1
swings	1
and	1
baths	1
all	1
of	1
special	1
pattern	1
and	1
modern	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
english	1
solid	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
make	1
and	1
obviously	1
very	1
expensive	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
very	1
light	1
and	1
lofty	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
baby	1
with	1
nothing	1
on	1
but	1
her	1
little	1
smock	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
elbow	1
chair	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
having	1
her	1
dinner	1
of	1
broth	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
spilling	1
all	1
over	1
her	1
little	1
chest	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
being	1
fed	1
and	1
the	1
russian	1
nursery	1
maid	1
was	1
evidently	1
sharing	1
her	1
meal	1
neither	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
nor	1
the	1
head	1
nurse	1
were	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
queer	1
french	1
which	1
was	1
their	1
only	1
means	1
of	1
communication	1
hearing	1
anna	1
s	1
voice	1
a	1
smart	1
tall	1
english	1
nurse	1
with	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
dissolute	1
expression	1
walked	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
hurriedly	1
shaking	1
her	1
fair	1
curls	1
and	1
immediately	1
began	1
to	1
defend	1
herself	1
though	1
anna	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
anna	1
said	1
the	1
english	1
nurse	1
said	1
hurriedly	1
several	1
times	1
yes	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
rosy	1
baby	1
with	1
her	1
black	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
hair	1
her	1
sturdy	1
red	1
little	1
body	1
with	1
tight	1
goose	1
flesh	1
skin	1
delighted	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
stranger	1
she	1
positively	1
envied	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
healthy	1
appearance	1
she	1
was	1
delighted	1
too	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
crawling	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
children	1
had	1
crawled	1
like	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
carpet	1
and	1
its	1
little	1
dress	1
tucked	1
up	1
behind	1
it	1
was	1
wonderfully	1
charming	1
looking	1
round	1
like	1
some	1
little	1
wild	1
animal	1
at	1
the	1
grown	1
up	1
big	1
people	1
with	1
her	1
bright	1
black	1
eyes	1
she	1
smiled	1
unmistakably	1
pleased	1
at	1
their	1
admiring	1
her	1
and	1
holding	1
her	1
legs	1
sideways	1
she	1
pressed	1
vigorously	1
on	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
rapidly	1
drew	1
her	1
whole	1
back	1
up	1
after	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
another	1
step	1
forward	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
arms	1
but	1
the	1
whole	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
english	1
nurse	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
at	1
all	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
no	1
good	1
nurse	1
would	1
have	1
entered	1
so	1
irregular	1
a	1
household	1
as	1
anna	1
s	1
that	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
could	1
explain	1
to	1
herself	1
how	1
anna	1
with	1
her	1
insight	1
into	1
people	1
could	1
take	1
such	1
an	1
unprepossessing	1
disreputable	1
looking	1
woman	1
as	1
nurse	1
to	1
her	1
child	1
besides	1
from	1
a	1
few	1
words	1

the	1

the	1
child	1
had	1
no	1
common	1
existence	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
s	1
visit	1
was	1
something	1
exceptional	1
anna	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
baby	1
her	1
plaything	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
most	1
amazing	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
on	1
being	1
asked	1
how	1
many	1
teeth	1
the	1
baby	1
had	1
anna	1
answered	1
wrong	1

out	1
of	1
the	1

up	1
her	1
skirt	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
plaything	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
different	1
with	1
my	1
first	1
child	1
i	1
expected	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
other	1
way	1

moment	1

some	1
lunch	1
for	1

them	1
all	1
in	1
princess	1
varvara	1
gave	1
dolly	1
a	1
cordial	1
and	1
rather	1
patronizing	1
reception	1
and	1
began	1
at	1
once	1
explaining	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
living	1
with	1
anna	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
cared	1
more	1
for	1
her	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
katerina	1
pavlovna	1
the	1
aunt	1
that	1
had	1
brought	1
anna	1
up	1
and	1
that	1
now	1
when	1

had	1
abandoned	1
anna	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
in	1
this	1
most	1
difficult	1
period	1
of	1
transition	1
her	1
husband	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
shall	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
solitude	1
but	1
now	1
i	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
doing	1
my	1
duty	1
however	1
difficult	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
me	1
not	1
like	1
some	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
how	1
sweet	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
you	1
how	1

of	1
you	1
to	1

interrupted	1
by	1

who	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
billiard	1
room	1
and	1
returned	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
terrace	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
the	1
dinner	1
hour	1
it	1
was	1
exquisite	1
weather	1
and	1
so	1
several	1
different	1
methods	1
of	1
spending	1
the	1
next	1
two	1
hours	1
were	1
proposed	1
there	1
were	1
very	1
many	1
methods	1
of	1
passing	1
the	1
time	1
at	1
vozdvizhenskoe	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
all	1
unlike	1

about	1

and	1

in	1
the	1

river	1
banks	1
vronsky	1
proposed	1
i	1
agree	1
to	1
anything	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
i	1
imagine	1
that	1
what	1
dolly	1
would	1
like	1
best	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
stroll	1
wouldn	1
t	1
you	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
boat	1
perhaps	1
said	1
anna	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
veslovsky	1
and	1
tushkevitch	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
bathing	1
place	1
promising	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
boat	1
ready	1
and	1
to	1
wait	1
there	1
for	1
them	1
they	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
in	1
two	1
couples	1
anna	1
with	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
dolly	1
with	1
vronsky	1
dolly	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
embarrassed	1
and	1
anxious	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
surroundings	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
abstractly	1
theoretically	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
justify	1
she	1
positively	1
approved	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
conduct	1
as	1
is	1
indeed	1
not	1
unfrequent	1
with	1
women	1
of	1
unimpeachable	1
virtue	1
weary	1
of	1
the	1
monotony	1
of	1
respectable	1
existence	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
she	1
not	1
only	1
excused	1
illicit	1
love	1
she	1
positively	1
envied	1
it	1
besides	1
she	1
loved	1
anna	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
but	1
seeing	1
anna	1
in	1
actual	1
life	1
among	1
these	1
strangers	1
with	1
this	1
fashionable	1
tone	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
new	1
to	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
she	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
what	1
she	1
disliked	1
particularly	1
was	1
seeing	1
princess	1
varvara	1
ready	1
to	1
overlook	1
everything	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
comforts	1
she	1
enjoyed	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
principle	1
abstractly	1
dolly	1
approved	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
action	1
but	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
man	1
for	1
whose	1
sake	1
her	1
action	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
was	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
her	1
moreover	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
liked	1
vronsky	1
she	1
thought	1
him	1
very	1
proud	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
proud	1
except	1
his	1
wealth	1
but	1
against	1
her	1
own	1
will	1
here	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
he	1
overawed	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
felt	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
with	1
the	1
maid	1
about	1
her	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
just	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
maid	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
not	1
exactly	1
ashamed	1
but	1
embarrassed	1
at	1
her	1
darns	1
so	1
she	1
felt	1
with	1
him	1
not	1
exactly	1
ashamed	1
but	1
embarrassed	1
at	1
herself	1
dolly	1
was	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
conversation	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
supposed	1
that	1
through	1
his	1
pride	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
tell	1
him	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
liked	1
his	1
house	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
building	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
fashioned	1
style	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
like	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
court	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
steps	1
was	1
that	1
always	1
so	1
oh	1
no	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
beamed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
court	1
last	1
spring	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
at	1
first	1
rather	1
diffidently	1
but	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
subject	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
various	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
decoration	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
having	1
devoted	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
trouble	1
to	1
improve	1
and	1
beautify	1
his	1
home	1
vronsky	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
show	1
off	1
the	1
improvements	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
person	1
and	1
was	1
genuinely	1
delighted	1
at	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
praise	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
care	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
hospital	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
tired	1
indeed	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
far	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
glancing	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
convince	1
himself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
bored	1
are	1
you	1
coming	1
anna	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
won	1
t	1
we	1
she	1
said	1
addressing	1
sviazhsky	1

turning	1
to	1

with	1
that	1
sly	1
smile	1
of	1
comprehension	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
previously	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
hospital	1
oh	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
real	1
importance	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
but	1
to	1
show	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
trying	1
to	1
ingratiate	1
himself	1
with	1
vronsky	1
he	1
promptly	1
added	1
some	1
slightly	1
critical	1
remarks	1
i	1
wonder	1
though	1
count	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
while	1
you	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
you	1
take	1
so	1

vronsky	1
you	1
understand	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
but	1
it	1
just	1
happens	1
so	1
my	1
interest	1
has	1
been	1
diverted	1
elsewhere	1
this	1
way	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
hospital	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
turning	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
the	1
ladies	1
put	1
up	1
their	1
parasols	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
side	1
path	1
after	1
going	1
down	1
several	1
turnings	1
and	1
going	1
through	1
a	1
little	1
gate	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
saw	1
standing	1
on	1
rising	1
ground	1
before	1
her	1
a	1
large	1
pretentious	1
looking	1
red	1
building	1
almost	1
finished	1
the	1
iron	1
roof	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
painted	1
shone	1
with	1
dazzling	1
brightness	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
beside	1
the	1
finished	1
building	1
another	1
had	1
been	1
begun	1
surrounded	1
by	1
scaffolding	1
workmen	1
in	1
aprons	1
standing	1
on	1
scaffolds	1
were	1
laying	1
bricks	1
pouring	1
mortar	1
out	1
of	1
vats	1
and	1
smoothing	1
it	1
with	1
trowels	1
how	1
quickly	1
work	1

done	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
here	1
last	1
time	1
the	1
roof	1
was	1
not	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
autumn	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
ready	1

almost	1
everything	1

new	1
building	1
that	1
s	1

house	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1

answered	1
vronsky	1
seeing	1
the	1
architect	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
jacket	1
coming	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
excusing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
going	1
round	1
a	1
hole	1
where	1
the	1
workmen	1
were	1
slaking	1
lime	1
he	1
stood	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
architect	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
rather	1
warmly	1
the	1
front	1
is	1
still	1
too	1
low	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
anna	1
who	1
had	1
asked	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
i	1
said	1
the	1
foundation	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
said	1
anna	1
yes	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
better	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
said	1
the	1
architect	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
too	1
late	1
yes	1
i	1
take	1
a	1
great	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
anna	1
answered	1
sviazhsky	1
who	1
was	1
expressing	1
his	1
surprise	1
at	1
her	1
knowledge	1
of	1
architecture	1
this	1
new	1
building	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
the	1
hospital	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
afterthought	1
and	1
was	1
begun	1
without	1
a	1
plan	1
vronsky	1
having	1
finished	1
his	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
architect	1
joined	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
led	1
them	1
inside	1
the	1
hospital	1
although	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
at	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
cornices	1
outside	1
and	1
were	1
painting	1
on	1
the	1

up	1

broad	1
cast	1
iron	1
staircase	1
to	1
the	1
landing	1
they	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
large	1
room	1
the	1
walls	1
were	1
stuccoed	1
to	1
look	1

already	1

the	1

and	1
the	1
carpenters	1
who	1
were	1
planing	1
a	1
block	1
of	1
it	1
left	1
their	1

taking	1
off	1
the	1

fastened	1
their	1

to	1
greet	1
the	1

the	1

dry	1
already	1
she	1
added	1
from	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
here	1
vronsky	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
mechanism	1
for	1
ventilation	1
on	1
a	1
novel	1
system	1
then	1
he	1
showed	1
them	1
marble	1
baths	1
and	1
beds	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
springs	1
then	1
he	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
wards	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
the	1
storeroom	1
the	1
linen	1
room	1
then	1
the	1

of	1
a	1

then	1
the	1
trolleys	1

would	1
make	1
no	1
noise	1
as	1
they	1
carried	1
everything	1
needed	1
along	1
the	1
corridors	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
sviazhsky	1
as	1
a	1
connoisseur	1
in	1
the	1
latest	1
mechanical	1
improvements	1
appreciated	1
everything	1
fully	1
dolly	1
simply	1
wondered	1
at	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
before	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
made	1
minute	1
inquiries	1
about	1
everything	1
which	1
gave	1
vronsky	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
yes	1
i	1
imagine	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
solitary	1
example	1
of	1
a	1
properly	1
fitted	1
hospital	1
in	1
russia	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
won	1
t	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
lying	1
in	1

asked	1
dolly	1
that	1
s	1
so	1
much	1
needed	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
courtesy	1
vronsky	1
interrupted	1
her	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
lying	1
in	1
home	1
but	1
a	1
hospital	1
for	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
is	1
intended	1
for	1
all	1
diseases	1
except	1
infectious	1
complaints	1
he	1
said	1
ah	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
and	1
he	1
rolled	1
up	1
to	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
an	1
invalid	1
chair	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
ordered	1
for	1
the	1
convalescents	1
look	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
chair	1
and	1
began	1
moving	1
it	1
the	1
patient	1
can	1
t	1
walk	1
still	1
too	1
weak	1
perhaps	1
or	1
something	1
wrong	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
but	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
air	1
and	1
he	1
moves	1
rolls	1
himself	1
along	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
was	1
interested	1
by	1
everything	1
she	1
liked	1
everything	1
very	1
much	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
she	1
liked	1
vronsky	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
natural	1
simple	1
hearted	1
eagerness	1
yes	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
good	1
man	1
she	1
thought	1
several	1
times	1
not	1
hearing	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
penetrating	1
into	1
his	1
expression	1
while	1
she	1
mentally	1
put	1
herself	1
in	1
anna	1
s	1
place	1
she	1
liked	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
just	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
eager	1
interest	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
how	1
anna	1
could	1
be	1

to	1

who	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1

where	1
sviazhsky	1
wished	1
to	1

the	1

we	1

have	1
a	1
little	1
talk	1
he	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
that	1
he	1
added	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
i	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
horses	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
answered	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
rather	1
astonished	1
she	1
saw	1
by	1
vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
something	1
from	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
little	1
gate	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
he	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
anna	1
had	1
taken	1
and	1
having	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
neither	1
hear	1
nor	1
see	1
them	1
he	1
began	1
you	1
guess	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
something	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
laughing	1
eyes	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
wrong	1
in	1
believing	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
wiped	1
his	1
head	1
which	1
was	1
growing	1
bald	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
merely	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
dismay	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
afraid	1
his	1
laughing	1
eyes	1
and	1
stern	1
expression	1
scared	1
her	1
the	1
most	1
diverse	1
suppositions	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
to	1
her	1
flashed	1
into	1
her	1
brain	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
beg	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
refuse	1
or	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
set	1
that	1
will	1
receive	1
anna	1
in	1
moscow	1
or	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
and	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
anna	1
or	1
perhaps	1
about	1
kitty	1
that	1
he	1
feels	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
all	1
her	1
conjectures	1
were	1
unpleasant	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
really	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
to	1
her	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
influence	1
with	1
anna	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
do	1
help	1
me	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
looked	1
with	1
timid	1
inquiry	1
into	1
his	1
energetic	1
face	1
which	1
under	1
the	1
lime	1
trees	1
was	1
continually	1
being	1
lighted	1
up	1
in	1
patches	1
by	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
then	1
passing	1
into	1
complete	1
shadow	1
again	1
she	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
but	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
silence	1
beside	1
her	1
scratching	1
with	1
his	1
cane	1
in	1
the	1
gravel	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
you	1
the	1
only	1
woman	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
former	1
friends	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
count	1
princess	1
varvara	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
not	1
because	1
you	1
regard	1
our	1
position	1
as	1
normal	1
but	1
because	1
understanding	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
you	1
still	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
help	1
to	1
her	1
have	1
i	1
understood	1
you	1
rightly	1
he	1
asked	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
oh	1
yes	1
answered	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
putting	1
down	1
her	1
sunshade	1
but	1
no	1
he	1
broke	1
in	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
oblivious	1
of	1
the	1
awkward	1
position	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
putting	1
his	1
companion	1
he	1
stopped	1
abruptly	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
stop	1
short	1
too	1
no	1
one	1
feels	1
more	1
deeply	1
and	1
intensely	1
than	1
i	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
anna	1
s	1
position	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
well	1
understand	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
supposing	1
i	1
have	1
any	1
heart	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
that	1
position	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
i	1
feel	1
it	1
i	1
understand	1
said	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
involuntarily	1
admiring	1
the	1
sincerity	1
and	1
firmness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
but	1
just	1
because	1
you	1
feel	1
yourself	1
responsible	1
you	1
exaggerate	1
it	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
she	1
said	1
her	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
difficult	1
i	1
can	1
well	1
understand	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
it	1
is	1
hell	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
quickly	1
frowning	1
darkly	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
moral	1
sufferings	1
greater	1
than	1
what	1
she	1
went	1
through	1
in	1
petersburg	1
in	1
that	1
fortnight	1
and	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
yes	1
but	1
here	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
neither	1
anna	1
nor	1
you	1
miss	1
society	1
society	1
he	1
said	1
contemptuously	1
how	1
could	1
i	1
miss	1
society	1
so	1
far	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
always	1
you	1
are	1
happy	1
and	1
at	1
peace	1
i	1
see	1
in	1
anna	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
happy	1
perfectly	1
happy	1
she	1
has	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
already	1
said	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
smiling	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
doubt	1
entered	1
her	1
mind	1
whether	1
anna	1
really	1
were	1
happy	1
but	1
vronsky	1
it	1
appeared	1
had	1
no	1
doubts	1
on	1
that	1
score	1
yes	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
know	1
that	1

has	1
revived	1
after	1
all	1
her	1
sufferings	1
she	1
is	1
happy	1
she	1
is	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
but	1
i	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
before	1
us	1
i	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
walk	1
on	1
no	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
mind	1
well	1
then	1
let	1
us	1
sit	1
here	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
garden	1
seat	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
facing	1
her	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
happy	1
he	1
repeated	1
and	1
the	1
doubt	1
whether	1
she	1
were	1
happy	1
sank	1
more	1
deeply	1
into	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
s	1
mind	1
but	1
can	1
it	1
last	1
whether	1
we	1
have	1
acted	1
rightly	1
or	1
wrongly	1
is	1
another	1
question	1
but	1
the	1
die	1
is	1
cast	1
he	1
said	1
passing	1
from	1
russian	1
to	1
french	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
together	1
for	1
life	1
we	1
are	1
united	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
ties	1
of	1
love	1
that	1
we	1
hold	1
most	1
sacred	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
child	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
other	1
children	1
but	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
our	1
position	1
are	1
such	1
that	1
thousands	1
of	1
complications	1
arise	1
which	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
well	1
understand	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
seeing	1
them	1
my	1
daughter	1
is	1
by	1
law	1
not	1
my	1
daughter	1
but	1
karenin	1
s	1
i	1
cannot	1
bear	1
this	1
falsity	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
vigorous	1
gesture	1
of	1
refusal	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
with	1
gloomy	1
inquiry	1
towards	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
simply	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
one	1
day	1
a	1
son	1
may	1
be	1
born	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
legally	1
a	1
karenin	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
heir	1
of	1
my	1
name	1
nor	1
of	1
my	1
property	1
and	1
however	1
happy	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
our	1
home	1
life	1
and	1
however	1
many	1
children	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
real	1
tie	1
between	1
us	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
karenins	1
you	1
can	1
understand	1
the	1
bitterness	1
and	1
horror	1
of	1
this	1
position	1
i	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
this	1
to	1
anna	1
it	1
irritates	1
her	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
i	1
cannot	1
speak	1
plainly	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
now	1
look	1
at	1
another	1
side	1
i	1
am	1
happy	1
happy	1
in	1
her	1
love	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
occupation	1
i	1
have	1
found	1
occupation	1
and	1
am	1
proud	1
of	1
what	1
i	1
am	1
doing	1
and	1
consider	1
it	1
nobler	1
than	1
the	1
pursuits	1
of	1
my	1
former	1
companions	1
at	1
court	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
most	1
certainly	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
change	1
the	1
work	1
i	1
am	1
doing	1
for	1
theirs	1
i	1
am	1
working	1
here	1
settled	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
place	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
happy	1
and	1
contented	1
and	1
we	1
need	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
happy	1

darya	1
alexandrovna	1
noticed	1
that	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
in	1
his	1
explanation	1
he	1
grew	1
confused	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
understand	1
this	1
digression	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
having	1
once	1
begun	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
matters	1
near	1
his	1
heart	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
anna	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
making	1
a	1
clean	1
breast	1
of	1
everything	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
his	1
pursuits	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
category	1
of	1
matters	1
near	1
his	1
heart	1
as	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
anna	1
well	1
i	1
will	1
go	1
on	1
he	1
said	1
collecting	1
himself	1
the	1
great	1
thing	1
is	1
that	1
as	1
i	1
work	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
conviction	1
that	1
what	1
i	1
am	1
doing	1
will	1
not	1
die	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
have	1
heirs	1
to	1
come	1
after	1
me	1
and	1
this	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
conceive	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
knows	1
that	1
his	1
children	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loves	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
his	1
but	1
will	1
belong	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
hates	1
them	1
and	1
cares	1
nothing	1
about	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
awful	1
he	1
paused	1
evidently	1
much	1
moved	1
yes	1
indeed	1
i	1
see	1
that	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
anna	1
do	1
queried	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
yes	1
that	1
brings	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
conversation	1
he	1
said	1
calming	1
himself	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
anna	1
can	1
it	1
depends	1
on	1
her	1
even	1
to	1
petition	1
the	1
tsar	1
for	1
legitimization	1
a	1
divorce	1
is	1
essential	1
and	1
that	1
depends	1
on	1
anna	1
her	1
husband	1
agreed	1
to	1
a	1
divorce	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
your	1
husband	1
had	1
arranged	1
it	1
completely	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
know	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
writing	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
plainly	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
expressed	1
the	1
desire	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
said	1
gloomily	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
pharisaical	1
cruelties	1
of	1
which	1
only	1
such	1
heartless	1
men	1
are	1
capable	1
he	1
knows	1
what	1
agony	1
any	1
recollection	1
of	1
him	1
must	1
give	1
her	1
and	1
knowing	1
her	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
her	1
i	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
agony	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
of	1
such	1
importance	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
passer	1
par	1
dessus	1
toutes	1

i	1
won	1
t	1
speak	1
of	1
myself	1
though	1
it	1
s	1
hard	1
for	1
me	1
very	1
hard	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
threatening	1
someone	1
for	1
its	1
being	1
hard	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
princess	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
shamelessly	1
clutching	1
at	1
you	1
as	1
an	1
anchor	1
of	1
salvation	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1

ask	1
for	1

of	1
course	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
said	1
dreamily	1
as	1
she	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
her	1
last	1
interview	1
with	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
yes	1
of	1
course	1

repeated	1
with	1
decision	1

your	1

with	1
her	1

her	1
write	1
i	1

i	1
m	1
almost	1
unable	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
very	1
well	1
i	1
will	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
herself	1
said	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
she	1
suddenly	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
recalled	1
anna	1
s	1
strange	1
new	1
habit	1
of	1
half	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
anna	1
drooped	1
her	1
eyelids	1
just	1
when	1
the	1
deeper	1
questions	1
of	1
life	1
were	1
touched	1
upon	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
half	1
shut	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
life	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
everything	1
thought	1
dolly	1
yes	1
indeed	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sake	1
and	1
for	1
hers	1
i	1
will	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
dolly	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
look	1
of	1
gratitude	1
they	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
chapter	1
22	1
when	1
anna	1
found	1
dolly	1
at	1
home	1
before	1
her	1
she	1
looked	1
intently	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
as	1
though	1
questioning	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
talk	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
with	1
vronsky	1
but	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
inquiry	1
in	1
words	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
s	1
dinner	1
time	1
she	1
said	1
we	1
ve	1
not	1
seen	1
each	1
other	1
at	1
all	1
yet	1
i	1
am	1
reckoning	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
now	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
and	1

i	1
expect	1
you	1
do	1
too	1
we	1
all	1
got	1
splashed	1
at	1
the	1
buildings	1
dolly	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
amused	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
dress	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
best	1
dress	1
but	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
signify	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
her	1
preparation	1
for	1
dinner	1
she	1
asked	1
the	1
maid	1
to	1
brush	1
her	1
dress	1
changed	1
her	1
cuffs	1
and	1
tie	1
and	1
put	1
some	1
lace	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
anna	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
third	1
dress	1
again	1
of	1
extreme	1
simplicity	1
yes	1
we	1
are	1
too	1
formal	1
here	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
apologizing	1
for	1
her	1
magnificence	1
alexey	1
is	1
delighted	1
at	1
your	1
visit	1
as	1
he	1
rarely	1
is	1
at	1
anything	1
he	1
has	1
completely	1
lost	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
tired	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
talking	1
about	1
anything	1
before	1
dinner	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
they	1
found	1
princess	1
varvara	1
already	1
there	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
black	1
frock	1
coats	1
the	1
architect	1
wore	1
a	1
swallow	1
tail	1
coat	1
vronsky	1
presented	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
to	1
his	1
guest	1
the	1
architect	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
introduced	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
hospital	1
a	1
stout	1
butler	1
resplendent	1
with	1
a	1
smoothly	1
shaven	1
round	1
chin	1
and	1
a	1
starched	1
white	1
cravat	1
announced	1
that	1
dinner	1
was	1
ready	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
got	1
up	1
vronsky	1
asked	1
sviazhsky	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
and	1
himself	1
offered	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
dolly	1
veslovsky	1
was	1
before	1
tushkevitch	1
in	1
offering	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
princess	1
varvara	1
so	1
that	1
tushkevitch	1
with	1
the	1
steward	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
walked	1
in	1
alone	1
the	1
dinner	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
the	1
service	1
the	1
waiting	1
at	1
table	1
the	1
wine	1
and	1
the	1
food	1
were	1
not	1
simply	1
in	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
tone	1
of	1
modern	1
luxury	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
seemed	1
even	1
more	1
sumptuous	1
and	1
modern	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
watched	1
this	1
luxury	1
which	1
was	1
novel	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
housekeeper	1
used	1
to	1
managing	1
a	1
household	1
although	1
she	1
never	1
dreamed	1
of	1
adapting	1
anything	1
she	1
saw	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
household	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
style	1
of	1
luxury	1
far	1
above	1
her	1
own	1
manner	1
of	1
living	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
scrutinizing	1
every	1
detail	1
and	1
wondering	1
how	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
even	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
people	1
she	1
knew	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
considered	1
this	1
question	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
readily	1
believed	1
what	1
every	1
well	1
bred	1
host	1
tries	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
guests	1
feel	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
well	1
ordered	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
has	1
cost	1
him	1
the	1
host	1
no	1
trouble	1
whatever	1
but	1
comes	1
of	1
itself	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
even	1
porridge	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
breakfast	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
of	1
itself	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
where	1
so	1
complicated	1
and	1
magnificent	1
a	1
style	1
of	1
luxury	1
was	1
maintained	1
someone	1
must	1
give	1
earnest	1
attention	1
to	1
its	1
organization	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
glance	1
with	1
which	1
alexey	1
kirillovitch	1
scanned	1
the	1
table	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
nodded	1
to	1
the	1
butler	1
and	1
offered	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
her	1
choice	1
between	1
cold	1
soup	1
and	1
hot	1
soup	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
organized	1
and	1
maintained	1
by	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
himself	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
all	1
rested	1
no	1
more	1
upon	1
anna	1
than	1
upon	1
veslovsky	1
she	1
sviazhsky	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
veslovsky	1
were	1
equally	1
guests	1
with	1
light	1
hearts	1
enjoying	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
for	1
them	1
anna	1
was	1
the	1
hostess	1
only	1
in	1
conducting	1
the	1
conversation	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
a	1
difficult	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
table	1
with	1
persons	1
present	1
like	1
the	1
steward	1
and	1
the	1
architect	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
completely	1
different	1
world	1
struggling	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overawed	1
by	1
an	1
elegance	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
unaccustomed	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
sustain	1
a	1
large	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
but	1
this	1
difficult	1
conversation	1
anna	1
directed	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
tact	1
and	1
naturalness	1
and	1
indeed	1
she	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
actual	1
enjoyment	1
as	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
observed	1
the	1
conversation	1
began	1
about	1
the	1
row	1
tushkevitch	1
and	1
veslovsky	1
had	1
taken	1
alone	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
tushkevitch	1
began	1
describing	1
the	1
last	1
boat	1
races	1
in	1
petersburg	1
at	1
the	1
yacht	1
club	1
but	1
anna	1
seizing	1
the	1
first	1
pause	1
at	1
once	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
architect	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
silence	1
nikolay	1
ivanitch	1
was	1
struck	1
she	1
said	1
meaning	1
sviazhsky	1
at	1
the	1
progress	1
the	1
new	1
building	1
had	1
made	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
last	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
there	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
i	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
grows	1
it	1
s	1
first	1
rate	1
working	1
with	1
his	1
excellency	1
said	1
the	1
architect	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
he	1
was	1
respectful	1
and	1
composed	1
though	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
dignity	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
matter	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
district	1
authorities	1
where	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
write	1
out	1
sheaves	1
of	1
papers	1
here	1
i	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
words	1
we	1
settle	1
the	1
business	1
the	1
american	1
way	1
of	1
doing	1
business	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
yes	1
there	1
they	1
build	1
in	1
a	1
rational	1
fashion	1
the	1
conversation	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
misuse	1
of	1
political	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
united	1
states	1
but	1
anna	1
quickly	1
brought	1
it	1
round	1
to	1
another	1
topic	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
steward	1
into	1
talk	1
have	1
you	1
ever	1
seen	1
a	1
reaping	1
machine	1
she	1
said	1
addressing	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
ridden	1
over	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
one	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
one	1
how	1
do	1
they	1
work	1
asked	1
dolly	1
exactly	1
like	1
little	1
scissors	1
a	1
plank	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
little	1
scissors	1
like	1
this	1
anna	1
took	1
a	1
knife	1
and	1
fork	1
in	1
her	1
beautiful	1
white	1
hands	1
covered	1
with	1
rings	1
and	1
began	1
showing	1
how	1
the	1
machine	1
worked	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
would	1
be	1
understood	1
from	1
her	1
explanation	1
but	1
aware	1
that	1
her	1
talk	1
was	1
pleasant	1
and	1
her	1
hands	1
beautiful	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
explaining	1
more	1
like	1
little	1
penknives	1
veslovsky	1
said	1
playfully	1
never	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
anna	1
gave	1
a	1
just	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
but	1
made	1
no	1

karl	1
fedoritch	1
that	1
it	1

just	1

said	1
to	1
the	1
steward	1
oh	1

	1
answered	1
the	1
german	1
	1
es	1
ist	1
ein	1
ganz	1
einfaches	1
ding	1
	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
machine	1

s	1
a	1
pity	1

doesn	1

at	1
the	1
vienna	1

just	1

in	1
the	1
pocket	1
where	1
were	1
his	1
pencil	1
and	1
the	1
notebook	1
he	1
always	1
wrote	1
in	1

that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
a	1

again	1
with	1

	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
playful	1
severity	1
we	1
expected	1
to	1

you	1

to	1
the	1

a	1
sickly	1
looking	1
man	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
there	1
i	1
went	1
there	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
taken	1
flight	1
the	1
doctor	1
answered	1
with	1
gloomy	1
jocoseness	1
then	1
you	1
ve	1
taken	1
a	1
good	1
constitutional	1
splendid	1
well	1

how	1

taking	1
a	1
bad	1

what	1
a	1
pity	1
said	1
anna	1
and	1
having	1
thus	1
paid	1
the	1
dues	1
of	1
civility	1
to	1
her	1
domestic	1
circle	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
friends	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
hard	1
task	1
though	1
to	1
construct	1
a	1
machine	1
from	1
your	1
description	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
sviazhsky	1
said	1
jestingly	1
oh	1
no	1
why	1
so	1
said	1
anna	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
betrayed	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
charming	1
in	1
her	1
disquisitions	1
upon	1
the	1
machine	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
noticed	1
by	1
sviazhsky	1
this	1
new	1
trait	1
of	1
girlish	1
coquettishness	1
made	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
on	1
dolly	1
but	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
s	1
knowledge	1
of	1
architecture	1
is	1
marvelous	1
said	1
tushkevitch	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
i	1
heard	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
talking	1
yesterday	1
about	1
plinths	1
and	1
damp	1
courses	1
said	1
veslovsky	1
have	1
i	1
got	1
it	1
right	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
marvelous	1
about	1
it	1
when	1
one	1
sees	1
and	1
hears	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
said	1
anna	1
but	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
houses	1
are	1
made	1
of	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
saw	1
that	1
anna	1
disliked	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
raillery	1
that	1
existed	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
veslovsky	1
but	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
it	1
against	1
her	1
will	1
vronsky	1
acted	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
quite	1
differently	1
from	1
levin	1
he	1
obviously	1
attached	1
no	1
significance	1
to	1
veslovsky	1
s	1
chattering	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
encouraged	1
his	1
jests	1
come	1
now	1
tell	1
us	1
veslovsky	1
how	1
are	1
the	1
stones	1
held	1
together	1
by	1
cement	1
of	1
course	1
bravo	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
cement	1
oh	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
paste	1
no	1
putty	1
said	1
veslovsky	1
raising	1
a	1
general	1
laugh	1
the	1
company	1
at	1
dinner	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
the	1
doctor	1
the	1
architect	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
who	1
remained	1
plunged	1
in	1
gloomy	1
silence	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
conversation	1
that	1
never	1
paused	1
glancing	1
off	1
one	1
subject	1
fastening	1
on	1
another	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
stinging	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
once	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
felt	1
wounded	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
got	1
so	1
hot	1
that	1
she	1
positively	1
flushed	1
and	1
wondered	1
afterwards	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
anything	1
extreme	1
or	1
unpleasant	1
sviazhsky	1
began	1
talking	1
of	1
levin	1
describing	1
his	1
strange	1
view	1
that	1
machinery	1
is	1
simply	1
pernicious	1
in	1
its	1
effects	1
on	1
russian	1
agriculture	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
knowing	1
this	1
m	1
levin	1
vronsky	1
said	1
smiling	1
but	1
most	1
likely	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
seen	1
the	1
machines	1
he	1
condemns	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
seen	1
and	1
tried	1
any	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
after	1
a	1
queer	1
fashion	1
some	1
russian	1
imitation	1

of	1

on	1

defend	1
his	1
opinions	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
said	1
firing	1
up	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
highly	1
cultivated	1
man	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
here	1
he	1
would	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
answer	1
you	1

sviazhsky	1
in	1
electing	1
me	1
a	1
justice	1
of	1

consider	1
that	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
being	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
session	1
of	1
judging	1
some	1
peasants	1
quarrel	1
about	1

anything	1

can	1

i	1
shall	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
honor	1
if	1
they	1
elect	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
i	1
can	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
advantages	1
i	1
enjoy	1
as	1
a	1
landowner	1
unluckily	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
the	1
weight	1
that	1
the	1
big	1
landowners	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
it	1
was	1
strange	1
to	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
to	1
hear	1
how	1
serenely	1
confident	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
being	1
right	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
table	1
she	1
thought	1
how	1
levin	1
who	1
believed	1
the	1
opposite	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
positive	1
in	1
his	1
opinions	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
table	1
but	1
she	1
loved	1
levin	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
so	1
we	1
can	1
reckon	1
upon	1
you	1
count	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
elections	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
a	1
little	1
beforehand	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
by	1
the	1
eighth	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
stop	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
rather	1
agree	1
with	1
your	1
beau	1
frère	1
said	1
anna	1
though	1
not	1
quite	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
ground	1
as	1
he	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
too	1
many	1
of	1
these	1
public	1
duties	1
in	1
these	1
latter	1
days	1
just	1
as	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
government	1
functionaries	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
a	1
functionary	1
for	1
every	1

thing	1
so	1
now	1
everyone	1

sort	1
of	1

has	1
been	1
here	1
now	1
six	1
months	1
and	1
he	1
s	1

do	1
believe	1
of	1
five	1

six	1
different	1
public	1
bodies	1

	1
the	1
whole	1

will	1
be	1
wasted	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
that	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
these	1
bodies	1
they	1

end	1
in	1
being	1

turned	1
to	1
sviazhsky	1
over	1
twenty	1
i	1
fancy	1
anna	1
spoke	1
lightly	1

be	1
discerned	1
in	1

watching	1

attentively	1
detected	1
it	1

that	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
had	1
immediately	1
taken	1
a	1
serious	1
and	1
obstinate	1
expression	1
noticing	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
princess	1
varvara	1
at	1
once	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
by	1
talking	1
of	1
petersburg	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
remembering	1
what	1
vronsky	1
had	1
without	1
apparent	1
connection	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
dolly	1
surmised	1
that	1
this	1
question	1
of	1
public	1
activity	1
was	1
connected	1
with	1
some	1
deep	1
private	1
disagreement	1
between	1
anna	1
and	1
vronsky	1
the	1
dinner	1
the	1
wine	1
the	1
decoration	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
were	1
all	1
very	1
good	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
like	1
what	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
formal	1
dinners	1
and	1
balls	1
which	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
had	1
become	1
quite	1
unfamiliar	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
all	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
impersonal	1
and	1
constrained	1
character	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
an	1
ordinary	1
day	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
circle	1
of	1
friends	1
it	1
made	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
on	1
her	1
after	1
dinner	1
they	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
then	1
they	1
proceeded	1
to	1
play	1
lawn	1
tennis	1
the	1
players	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
parties	1
stood	1
on	1
opposite	1
sides	1
of	1
a	1
tightly	1
drawn	1
net	1
with	1
gilt	1
poles	1
on	1
the	1
carefully	1
leveled	1
and	1
rolled	1
croquet	1
ground	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
made	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
play	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
understand	1
the	1
game	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
did	1
understand	1
it	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
princess	1
varvara	1
and	1
simply	1
looked	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
players	1
her	1
partner	1
tushkevitch	1
gave	1
up	1
playing	1
too	1
but	1
the	1
others	1
kept	1
the	1
game	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
vronsky	1
both	1
played	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
seriously	1
they	1
kept	1
a	1
sharp	1
lookout	1
on	1
the	1
balls	1
served	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
without	1
haste	1
or	1
getting	1
in	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
way	1
they	1
ran	1
adroitly	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
rebound	1
and	1
neatly	1
and	1
accurately	1
returned	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
net	1
veslovsky	1
played	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
eager	1
but	1
he	1
kept	1
the	1
players	1
lively	1
with	1
his	1
high	1
spirits	1
his	1
laughter	1
and	1
outcries	1
never	1
paused	1
like	1
the	1
other	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
permission	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
his	1
solid	1
comely	1
figure	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
with	1
his	1
red	1
perspiring	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
impulsive	1
movements	1
made	1
a	1
picture	1
that	1
imprinted	1
itself	1
vividly	1
on	1
the	1
memory	1
when	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
lay	1
in	1
bed	1
that	1
night	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
she	1
saw	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
flying	1
about	1
the	1
croquet	1
ground	1
during	1
the	1
game	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
was	1
not	1
enjoying	1
herself	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
light	1
tone	1
of	1
raillery	1
that	1
was	1
kept	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
between	1
vassenka	1
veslovsky	1
and	1
anna	1
and	1
the	1
unnaturalness	1
altogether	1
of	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
all	1
alone	1
without	1
children	1
playing	1
at	1
a	1
child	1
s	1
game	1
but	1
to	1
avoid	1
breaking	1
up	1
the	1
party	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
the	1
time	1
somehow	1
after	1
a	1
rest	1
she	1
joined	1
the	1
game	1
again	1
and	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
enjoying	1
it	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
acting	1
in	1
a	1
theater	1
with	1
actors	1
cleverer	1
than	1
she	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
bad	1
acting	1
was	1
spoiling	1
the	1
whole	1
performance	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
staying	1
two	1
days	1
if	1
all	1
went	1
well	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
during	1
the	1
game	1
she	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
home	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
maternal	1
cares	1
and	1
worries	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
hated	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
now	1
after	1
a	1
day	1
spent	1
without	1
them	1
struck	1
her	1
in	1
quite	1
another	1
light	1
and	1
tempted	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
them	1
when	1
after	1
evening	1
tea	1
and	1
a	1
row	1
by	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
went	1
alone	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
began	1
arranging	1
her	1
thin	1
hair	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
it	1
was	1
positively	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
anna	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
immediately	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts	1

dolly	1
was	1
wanting	1
to	1
go	1
to	1

when	1
anna	1
came	1
in	1
to	1

her	1
attired	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
anna	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
begun	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
matters	1
near	1
her	1
heart	1

every	1

after	1
a	1

she	1

sat	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
looking	1
at	1
dolly	1
and	1
going	1
over	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
all	1
the	1
stores	1
of	1
intimate	1
talk	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
so	1
inexhaustible	1
beforehand	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
nothing	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
already	1
well	1
what	1
of	1
kitty	1
she	1

or	1
alexey	1

with	1
alexey	1
said	1
anna	1

i	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1

of	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
life	1

that	1
you	1
re	1

in	1
the	1
summer	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
us	1

we	1
are	1
not	1
alone	1

we	1
came	1
here	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
lived	1
quite	1
alone	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
alone	1
again	1
and	1
i	1
desire	1
nothing	1
better	1
but	1
imagine	1
me	1
living	1
alone	1
without	1
him	1
alone	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
i	1
see	1
by	1
everything	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
often	1
be	1
repeated	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
half	1
the	1
time	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
close	1
by	1
dolly	1
of	1
course	1
she	1
interrupted	1
dolly	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
try	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
by	1

him	1
indeed	1
the	1

just	1
coming	1
his	1
horses	1
are	1
running	1
he	1
will	1
go	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
but	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
fancy	1
my	1
position	1
but	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking	1
about	1
it	1
she	1
smiled	1
well	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
talk	1
about	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
what	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
easy	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
advocate	1
of	1
whether	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
possibility	1
whether	1
you	1

not	1
darya	1

hesitated	1

your	1

you	1

how	1

at	1
it	1

all	1
the	1
same	1
if	1

you	1
should	1
get	1
married	1
divorce	1
you	1
mean	1

she	1
had	1
an	1
intrigue	1
with	1
tushkevitch	1
deceiving	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
the	1
basest	1
way	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
know	1
me	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
position	1
was	1

compare	1
i	1

you	1

but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
remembering	1
well	1
so	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
repeated	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unhappy	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
egoism	1
but	1
what	1
a	1
legitimate	1
and	1
noble	1
egoism	1
he	1
wants	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
legitimize	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
husband	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
legal	1
right	1
to	1
you	1
what	1
wife	1
what	1
slave	1

be	1
so	1
utterly	1
a	1
slave	1
as	1
i	1
in	1
my	1
position	1
she	1
put	1
in	1
gloomily	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
he	1
desires	1
he	1
desires	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
s	1
impossible	1
well	1
well	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
legitimate	1
desire	1
he	1
wishes	1
that	1
your	1
children	1
should	1
have	1
a	1

said	1
dolly	1
opening	1
her	1
eyes	1
wide	1
for	1
her	1
this	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
discoveries	1
the	1
consequences	1
and	1
deductions	1
from	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
immense	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
one	1
feels	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
all	1
in	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
reflect	1
a	1
great	1
great	1
deal	1
upon	1
it	1
this	1
discovery	1
suddenly	1
throwing	1
light	1
on	1
all	1
those	1
families	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
children	1
which	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
so	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
her	1
aroused	1
so	1
many	1
ideas	1
reflections	1
and	1
contradictory	1
emotions	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
simply	1
gazed	1
with	1
wide	1
open	1
eyes	1
of	1
wonder	1
at	1
anna	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
dreaming	1
of	1
but	1
now	1
learning	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
she	1
was	1
horrified	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1

she	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
her	1

she	1

other	1
arguments	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
no	1

do	1
you	1

that	1
it	1

you	1
must	1
consider	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
you	1
forget	1
my	1
position	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
desire	1
children	1
i	1
m	1
not	1

of	1
the	1

i	1

that	1

only	1
what	1
are	1
my	1
children	1
to	1
be	1
ill	1

will	1
have	1
to	1

a	1

the	1
very	1
fact	1
of	1

be	1
forced	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
mother	1
their	1

their	1
birth	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
why	1
a	1
divorce	1
is	1
necessary	1
but	1
anna	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
arguments	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
times	1
convinced	1
herself	1
what	1
is	1
reason	1
given	1
me	1
for	1
if	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
to	1
avoid	1
bringing	1
unhappy	1
beings	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
dolly	1
but	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
should	1
always	1
feel	1
i	1
had	1
wronged	1
these	1
unhappy	1
children	1
she	1
said	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
unhappy	1
while	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
unhappy	1
i	1
alone	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
arguments	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
had	1
used	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
reflections	1
but	1
she	1
heard	1
them	1
without	1
understanding	1
them	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
wrong	1
creatures	1
that	1
don	1
t	1
exist	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
idea	1
struck	1
her	1
could	1
it	1
possibly	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
her	1
favorite	1
grisha	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
existed	1
and	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
wild	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
drive	1
away	1

of	1
whirling	1
mad	1

all	1
she	1

with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
disgust	1
on	1
her	1

to	1

now	1
in	1
the	1

position	1
as	1
you	1
for	1

for	1

suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1

got	1
far	1
away	1
from	1

there	1
lay	1
between	1
them	1
a	1
barrier	1
of	1
questions	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
never	1

about	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
not	1

herself	1

memories	1
of	1

of	1
her	1

up	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
charm	1
quite	1
new	1

her	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
new	1
brilliance	1
that	1
world	1
of	1

to	1

now	1
so	1
sweet	1

precious	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
spend	1
an	1
extra	1
day	1
outside	1
it	1

she	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
certainly	1
go	1
back	1
next	1
day	1
anna	1
meantime	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
boudoir	1
took	1
a	1
wine	1

dropped	1
into	1
it	1
several	1
drops	1
of	1
a	1
medicine	1

ingredient	1
was	1

went	1
into	1
her	1
bedroom	1
in	1
a	1
soothed	1
and	1
more	1
cheerful	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
vronsky	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
staying	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
dolly	1
s	1
room	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
expression	1
of	1
restrained	1
excitement	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
reserve	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
beauty	1
that	1
always	1
bewitched	1
him	1
afresh	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
affect	1
him	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
of	1
but	1
he	1
hoped	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
him	1
something	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
accord	1
but	1
she	1
only	1
said	1
i	1

the	1

smiled	1

a	1
day	1

together	1

her	1

were	1
distinctly	1
aware	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1

that	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
to	1

only	1
anna	1

sad	1

knew	1
that	1
now	1
from	1

departure	1
no	1

stir	1
up	1
within	1

by	1
their	1

up	1

yet	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
that	1
was	1

of	1

that	1
that	1

of	1

quickly	1

smothered	1
in	1

a	1

ask	1
the	1

how	1

at	1

in	1

dreary	1
there	1

finding	1

satisfactory	1
and	1
particularly	1
charming	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
began	1
with	1
great	1
liveliness	1
telling	1
them	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
arrived	1
how	1
warmly	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
luxury	1
and	1
good	1
taste	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
vronskys	1
lived	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
recreations	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
against	1
them	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
know	1
anna	1
and	1
vronsky	1
i	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
know	1
him	1
better	1
now	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
nice	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
how	1
touching	1
she	1
said	1
speaking	1
now	1
with	1
perfect	1
sincerity	1
and	1
forgetting	1
the	1
vague	1
feeling	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
and	1
awkwardness	1
she	1
had	1
experienced	1
there	1
chapter	1
25	1
vronsky	1
and	1
anna	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
summer	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
living	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
condition	1
and	1
still	1
taking	1
no	1
steps	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
divorce	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
understood	1
thing	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
away	1
anywhere	1
but	1
both	1
felt	1
the	1
longer	1
they	1
lived	1
alone	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
without	1
guests	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
this	1
existence	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
alter	1
it	1
their	1
life	1
was	1
apparently	1
such	1
that	1
nothing	1
better	1
could	1
be	1
desired	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
fullest	1
abundance	1
of	1
everything	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
both	1
had	1
occupation	1
anna	1
devoted	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
care	1
to	1
her	1
appearance	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
visitors	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
reading	1
both	1
of	1
novels	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
serious	1
literature	1
was	1
in	1
fashion	1
she	1
ordered	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
were	1
praised	1
in	1
the	1
foreign	1
papers	1
and	1
reviews	1
she	1
received	1
and	1
read	1
them	1
with	1
that	1
concentrated	1
attention	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
given	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
read	1
in	1
seclusion	1
moreover	1
every	1
subject	1
that	1
was	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
vronsky	1
she	1
studied	1
in	1
books	1
and	1
special	1
journals	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
often	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
questions	1
relating	1
to	1
agriculture	1
or	1
architecture	1
sometimes	1
even	1
with	1
questions	1
relating	1
to	1
horse	1
breeding	1
or	1
sport	1
he	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
her	1
knowledge	1
her	1
memory	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
doubt	1
it	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
confirmation	1
of	1
her	1
facts	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
find	1
what	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
in	1
some	1
book	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
hospital	1
too	1
interested	1
her	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
assist	1
but	1
planned	1
and	1
suggested	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
herself	1
but	1
her	1
chief	1
thought	1
was	1
still	1
of	1
herself	1
how	1
far	1
she	1
was	1
dear	1
to	1
vronsky	1
how	1
far	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
vronsky	1
appreciated	1
this	1
desire	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
please	1
but	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
sole	1
aim	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
wearied	1
of	1
the	1
loving	1
snares	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
fast	1
as	1
time	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
held	1
fast	1
in	1
these	1
snares	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
ever	1
growing	1
desire	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
them	1
as	1
to	1
try	1
whether	1
they	1
hindered	1
his	1
freedom	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
this	1
growing	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
scenes	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
to	1
a	1
meeting	1
or	1
a	1
race	1
vronsky	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
life	1
the	1
rôle	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
rôle	1
of	1
a	1
wealthy	1
landowner	1
one	1
of	1
that	1
class	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
aristocracy	1
was	1
entirely	1
to	1
his	1
taste	1
and	1
now	1
after	1
spending	1
six	1
months	1
in	1
that	1
character	1
he	1
derived	1
even	1
greater	1
satisfaction	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
management	1
of	1
his	1
estate	1
which	1
occupied	1
and	1
absorbed	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
was	1
most	1
successful	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
immense	1
sums	1
cost	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hospital	1
by	1
machinery	1
by	1
cows	1
ordered	1
from	1
switzerland	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
wasting	1
but	1
increasing	1
his	1
substance	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
affecting	1
income	1
the	1
sales	1
of	1
timber	1
wheat	1
and	1
wool	1
the	1
letting	1
of	1
lands	1
vronsky	1
was	1
hard	1
as	1
a	1
rock	1
and	1
knew	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
prices	1
in	1
all	1
operations	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale	1
on	1
this	1
and	1
his	1
other	1
estates	1
he	1
kept	1
to	1
the	1
simplest	1
methods	1
involving	1
no	1
risk	1
and	1
in	1
trifling	1
details	1
he	1
was	1
careful	1
and	1
exacting	1
to	1
an	1
extreme	1
degree	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
cunning	1
and	1
ingenuity	1
of	1
the	1
german	1
steward	1
who	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
tempt	1
him	1
into	1
purchases	1
by	1
making	1
his	1
original	1
estimate	1
always	1
far	1
larger	1
than	1
really	1
required	1
and	1
then	1
representing	1
to	1
vronsky	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
get	1
the	1
thing	1
cheaper	1
and	1
so	1
make	1
a	1
profit	1
vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
in	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
steward	1
cross	1
examined	1
him	1
and	1
only	1
agreed	1
to	1
his	1
suggestions	1
when	1
the	1
implement	1
to	1
be	1
ordered	1
or	1
constructed	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
newest	1
not	1
yet	1
known	1
in	1
russia	1
and	1
likely	1
to	1
excite	1
wonder	1
apart	1
from	1
such	1
exceptions	1
he	1
resolved	1
upon	1
an	1
increased	1
outlay	1
only	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
surplus	1
and	1
in	1
making	1
such	1
an	1
outlay	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
getting	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
for	1
his	1
money	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
method	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
managed	1
his	1
affairs	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
wasting	1
but	1
increasing	1
his	1
substance	1
in	1
october	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
provincial	1
elections	1
in	1
the	1
kashinsky	1
province	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
estates	1
of	1
vronsky	1
sviazhsky	1
koznishev	1
oblonsky	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
land	1
these	1
elections	1
were	1
attracting	1
public	1
attention	1
from	1
several	1
circumstances	1
connected	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
them	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
talk	1
about	1
them	1
and	1
great	1
preparations	1
were	1
being	1
made	1
for	1
them	1
persons	1
who	1
never	1
attended	1
the	1
elections	1
were	1
coming	1
from	1
moscow	1
from	1
petersburg	1
and	1
from	1
abroad	1
to	1
attend	1
these	1
vronsky	1
had	1
long	1
before	1
promised	1
sviazhsky	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
elections	1
sviazhsky	1
who	1
often	1
visited	1
vozdvizhenskoe	1
drove	1
over	1
to	1
fetch	1
vronsky	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
almost	1
a	1
quarrel	1
between	1
vronsky	1
and	1
anna	1
over	1
this	1
proposed	1
expedition	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
dullest	1
autumn	1
weather	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
dreary	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
so	1
preparing	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
struggle	1
vronsky	1
with	1
a	1
hard	1
and	1
cold	1
expression	1
informed	1
anna	1
of	1
his	1
departure	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
before	1
but	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
anna	1
accepted	1
the	1
information	1
with	1
great	1
composure	1
and	1
merely	1
asked	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
back	1
he	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
her	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
explain	1
this	1
composure	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
his	1
look	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
way	1
she	1
had	1
of	1
withdrawing	1
into	1
herself	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
only	1
happened	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
determined	1
upon	1
something	1
without	1
letting	1
him	1
know	1
her	1
plans	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
scene	1
that	1
he	1
kept	1
up	1
appearances	1
and	1
half	1
sincerely	1
believed	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1

in	1

took	1
great	1

in	1

approaching	1

made	1
ready	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
to	1

he	1
invited	1
his	1

had	1
a	1
vote	1
in	1
the	1

district	1
to	1
come	1

moreover	1
to	1
transact	1
in	1

some	1
extremely	1
important	1
business	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1

to	1
the	1
receiving	1
of	1
certain	1

money	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
who	1
was	1
abroad	1
levin	1
still	1
hesitated	1
but	1
kitty	1
who	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
bored	1
in	1
moscow	1
and	1
urged	1
him	1
to	1
go	1

that	1
seven	1

the	1

cause	1
that	1
finally	1
decided	1

to	1
go	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
kashin	1
levin	1
had	1
been	1
six	1
days	1
in	1
kashin	1
visiting	1
the	1
assembly	1
each	1
day	1
and	1
busily	1
engaged	1
about	1
his	1

business	1
which	1
still	1
dragged	1
on	1
the	1
district	1
marshals	1
of	1
nobility	1
were	1
all	1
occupied	1
with	1
the	1
elections	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
simplest	1
thing	1
done	1
that	1
depended	1
upon	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
wardship	1
the	1
other	1
matter	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
the	1
sums	1
due	1
was	1
met	1
too	1
by	1
difficulties	1
after	1
long	1
negotiations	1
over	1
the	1
legal	1
details	1
the	1
money	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
but	1
the	1
notary	1
a	1
most	1
obliging	1
person	1
could	1
not	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
order	1
because	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
signature	1
of	1
the	1
president	1
and	1
the	1
president	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
given	1
over	1
his	1
duties	1
to	1
a	1
deputy	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
elections	1
all	1
these	1
worrying	1
negotiations	1
this	1
endless	1
going	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
and	1
talking	1
with	1
pleasant	1
and	1
excellent	1
people	1
who	1
quite	1
saw	1
the	1
unpleasantness	1
of	1
the	1
petitioner	1
s	1
position	1
but	1
were	1
powerless	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
all	1
these	1
efforts	1
that	1
yielded	1
no	1
result	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
misery	1
in	1
levin	1
akin	1
to	1
the	1
mortifying	1
helplessness	1
one	1
experiences	1
in	1
dreams	1
when	1
one	1
tries	1
to	1
use	1
physical	1
force	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
frequently	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
his	1
most	1
good	1
natured	1
solicitor	1
this	1
solicitor	1
did	1
it	1
seemed	1
everything	1
possible	1
and	1
strained	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
difficulties	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
you	1
might	1
try	1
he	1
said	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
go	1
to	1
so	1
and	1
so	1
and	1
so	1
and	1
so	1
and	1
the	1
solicitor	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
regular	1
plan	1
for	1
getting	1
round	1
the	1
fatal	1
point	1
that	1
hindered	1
everything	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
add	1
immediately	1
it	1
ll	1
mean	1
some	1
delay	1
anyway	1
but	1
you	1
might	1
try	1
it	1
and	1
levin	1
did	1
try	1
and	1
did	1
go	1
everyone	1
was	1
kind	1
and	1
civil	1
but	1
the	1
point	1
evaded	1
seemed	1
to	1
crop	1
up	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
bar	1
the	1
way	1
what	1
was	1
particularly	1
trying	1
was	1
that	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
struggling	1
to	1
whose	1
interest	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
business	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
solicitor	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
if	1
levin	1
could	1
have	1
understood	1
why	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
why	1
one	1
can	1
only	1
approach	1
the	1
booking	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
railway	1
station	1
in	1
single	1
file	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
vexatious	1
and	1
tiresome	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
hindrances	1
that	1
confronted	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
business	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
explain	1
why	1
they	1
existed	1
but	1
levin	1
had	1
changed	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
since	1
his	1
marriage	1
he	1
was	1
patient	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
arranged	1
like	1
this	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
judge	1
without	1
knowing	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
most	1
likely	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
fret	1
in	1
attending	1
the	1
elections	1
too	1
and	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
them	1
he	1
tried	1
now	1
not	1
to	1
judge	1
not	1
to	1
fall	1
foul	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
to	1
comprehend	1
as	1
fully	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
earnestly	1
and	1
ardently	1
absorbing	1
honest	1
and	1
excellent	1
men	1
whom	1
he	1
respected	1
since	1
his	1
marriage	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
levin	1
so	1
many	1
new	1
and	1
serious	1
aspects	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
previously	1
through	1
his	1
frivolous	1
attitude	1
to	1
them	1
seemed	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
elections	1
too	1
he	1
assumed	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
serious	1
significance	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
meaning	1
and	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
revolution	1
at	1
the	1
elections	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
in	1
whose	1
hands	1
the	1
law	1
had	1
placed	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
important	1
public	1
functions	1
the	1
guardianship	1
of	1
wards	1
the	1
very	1
department	1
which	1
was	1
giving	1
levin	1
so	1
much	1
trouble	1
just	1
now	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
large	1
sums	1
subscribed	1
by	1
the	1

the	1

schools	1
female	1
male	1
and	1

and	1
popular	1
instruction	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
model	1
and	1
finally	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
snetkov	1
was	1
a	1
nobleman	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
school	1
dissipating	1
an	1
immense	1
fortune	1
a	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
honest	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
fashion	1
but	1
utterly	1
without	1
any	1
comprehension	1
of	1
the	1
needs	1
of	1
modern	1
days	1
he	1
always	1
took	1
in	1
every	1
question	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
he	1
was	1
positively	1
antagonistic	1
to	1
the	1
spread	1
of	1
popular	1
education	1
and	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
giving	1
a	1
purely	1
party	1
character	1
to	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
which	1
ought	1
by	1
rights	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
immense	1
importance	1
what	1
was	1
needed	1
was	1
to	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
a	1
fresh	1
capable	1
perfectly	1
modern	1
man	1
of	1
contemporary	1
ideas	1
and	1
to	1
frame	1
their	1
policy	1
so	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
rights	1
conferred	1
upon	1
the	1
nobles	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
nobility	1
but	1
as	1
an	1
element	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
to	1
extract	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
self	1
government	1
that	1
could	1
possibly	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wealthy	1
kashinsky	1
province	1
which	1
always	1
took	1
the	1
lead	1
of	1
other	1
provinces	1
in	1
everything	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
such	1
a	1
preponderance	1
of	1
forces	1
that	1
this	1
policy	1
once	1
carried	1
through	1
properly	1
there	1
might	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
model	1
for	1
other	1
provinces	1
for	1
all	1
russia	1
and	1
hence	1
the	1
whole	1
question	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
importance	1
it	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
elect	1
as	1
marshal	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
snetkov	1
either	1
sviazhsky	1
or	1
better	1
still	1
nevyedovsky	1
a	1
former	1
university	1
professor	1

man	1
of	1
remarkable	1
intelligence	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
the	1
meeting	1
was	1
opened	1
by	1
the	1
governor	1
who	1
made	1
a	1
speech	1
to	1
the	1
nobles	1
urging	1
them	1
to	1
elect	1
the	1
public	1
functionaries	1
not	1
from	1
regard	1
for	1
persons	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
welfare	1
of	1
their	1
fatherland	1
and	1
hoping	1
that	1
the	1
honorable	1
nobility	1
of	1
the	1
kashinsky	1
province	1
would	1
as	1
at	1
all	1
former	1
elections	1
hold	1
their	1
duty	1
as	1
sacred	1
and	1
vindicate	1
the	1
exalted	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
monarch	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
with	1
his	1
speech	1
the	1
governor	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
the	1
noblemen	1
noisily	1
and	1
eagerly	1
some	1
even	1
enthusiastically	1
followed	1
him	1
and	1
thronged	1
round	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
and	1
conversed	1
amicably	1
with	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
levin	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
into	1
everything	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
anything	1
stood	1
there	1
too	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
governor	1
say	1
please	1
tell	1
marya	1
ivanovna	1
my	1
wife	1
is	1
very	1
sorry	1
she	1
couldn	1
t	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
home	1
and	1
thereupon	1
the	1
nobles	1
in	1
high	1
good	1
humor	1
sorted	1
out	1
their	1
fur	1
coats	1
and	1
all	1
drove	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
cathedral	1
in	1
the	1
cathedral	1
levin	1
lifting	1
his	1
hand	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
repeating	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
archdeacon	1
swore	1
with	1
most	1
terrible	1
oaths	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
hoped	1
they	1
would	1
do	1
church	1
services	1
always	1
affected	1
levin	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
the	1
words	1
i	1
kiss	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
men	1
repeating	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
felt	1
touched	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
and	1
third	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
business	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
finances	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
and	1
the	1
female	1
high	1
school	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
whatever	1
as	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
explained	1
and	1
levin	1
busy	1
seeing	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
affairs	1
did	1
not	1
attend	1
the	1
meetings	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
the	1
auditing	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
s	1
accounts	1
took	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
high	1
table	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
and	1
then	1
there	1
occurred	1
the	1
first	1
skirmish	1
between	1
the	1
new	1
party	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
the	1
committee	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
deputed	1
to	1
verify	1
the	1
accounts	1
reported	1
to	1
the	1
meeting	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
got	1
up	1
thanked	1
the	1
nobility	1
for	1
their	1
confidence	1
and	1
shed	1
tears	1
the	1
nobles	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
loud	1
welcome	1
and	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
a	1
nobleman	1
of	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
party	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
committee	1
had	1
not	1
verified	1
the	1
accounts	1
considering	1
such	1
a	1
verification	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
incautiously	1
admitted	1
this	1
then	1
a	1
small	1
gentleman	1
very	1
young	1
looking	1
but	1
very	1
malignant	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
probably	1
be	1
agreeable	1
to	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
expenditures	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
moneys	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
misplaced	1
delicacy	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
was	1
depriving	1
him	1
of	1
this	1
moral	1
satisfaction	1
then	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
tried	1
to	1
withdraw	1
their	1
admission	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
began	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
logically	1
admit	1
either	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
verified	1
the	1
accounts	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
and	1
he	1
developed	1
this	1
dilemma	1
in	1
detail	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
answered	1
by	1
the	1
spokesman	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
party	1
then	1
sviazhsky	1
spoke	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
again	1
the	1
discussion	1
lasted	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
and	1
ended	1
in	1
nothing	1
levin	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
dispute	1
upon	1
this	1
subject	1
so	1
long	1
especially	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
whether	1
he	1
supposed	1
that	1
money	1
had	1
been	1
misappropriated	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
answered	1
oh	1
no	1
he	1
s	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
but	1
those	1
old	1
fashioned	1
methods	1
of	1
paternal	1
family	1
arrangements	1
in	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
provincial	1
affairs	1
must	1
be	1
broken	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
came	1
the	1
elections	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
marshals	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
stormy	1
day	1
in	1
several	1
districts	1
in	1
the	1
seleznevsky	1
district	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
elected	1
unanimously	1
without	1
a	1
ballot	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
dinner	1
that	1
evening	1
chapter	1
27	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
the	1
rooms	1
large	1
and	1
small	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
noblemen	1
in	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
uniforms	1
many	1
had	1
come	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
years	1
some	1
from	1
the	1
crimea	1
some	1
from	1
petersburg	1
some	1
from	1
abroad	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
rooms	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
nobility	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
discussion	1
around	1
the	1
governor	1
s	1
table	1
under	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
tsar	1
the	1
nobles	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
larger	1
and	1
the	1
smaller	1
rooms	1
grouped	1
themselves	1
in	1
camps	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
hostile	1
and	1
suspicious	1
glances	1
from	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
fell	1
upon	1
them	1
when	1
outsiders	1
approached	1
a	1
group	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
some	1
whispering	1
together	1
retreated	1
to	1
the	1
farther	1
corridor	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
each	1
side	1
had	1
secrets	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
appearance	1
the	1
noblemen	1
were	1
sharply	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
classes	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
the	1
old	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
either	1
in	1
old	1
uniforms	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
buttoned	1
up	1
closely	1
with	1
spurs	1
and	1
hats	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
special	1
naval	1
cavalry	1
infantry	1
or	1
official	1
uniforms	1
the	1
uniforms	1
of	1
the	1
older	1
men	1
were	1
embroidered	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
fashioned	1
way	1
with	1
epaulets	1
on	1
their	1
shoulders	1
they	1
were	1
unmistakably	1
tight	1
and	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
waist	1
as	1
though	1
their	1
wearers	1
had	1
grown	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
wore	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
with	1
long	1
waists	1
and	1
broad	1
shoulders	1
unbuttoned	1
over	1
white	1
waistcoats	1
or	1
uniforms	1
with	1
black	1
collars	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
embroidered	1
badges	1
of	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
to	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
belonged	1
the	1
court	1
uniforms	1
that	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
brightened	1
up	1
the	1
crowd	1
but	1
the	1
division	1
into	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
did	1
not	1
correspond	1
with	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
parties	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
as	1
levin	1
observed	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
party	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
oldest	1
noblemen	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
were	1
whispering	1
with	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
were	1
evidently	1
ardent	1
partisans	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
party	1
levin	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
smaller	1
room	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
smoking	1
and	1
taking	1
light	1
refreshments	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
friends	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
he	1
conscientiously	1
exerted	1
all	1
his	1
intelligence	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
the	1
center	1
round	1
which	1
the	1
others	1
grouped	1
themselves	1
he	1
was	1
listening	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
to	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
hliustov	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
another	1
district	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
their	1
party	1
hliustov	1
would	1
not	1
agree	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
his	1
district	1
to	1
ask	1
snetkov	1
to	1
stand	1
while	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
persuading	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
approving	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
why	1
the	1
opposition	1
was	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
marshal	1
to	1
stand	1
whom	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
supersede	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
drinking	1
and	1
taking	1
some	1
lunch	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
uniform	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
wiping	1
his	1
lips	1
with	1
a	1
perfumed	1
handkerchief	1
of	1
bordered	1
batiste	1
we	1
are	1
placing	1
our	1
forces	1
he	1
said	1
pulling	1
out	1
his	1
whiskers	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
supported	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
contention	1
one	1
district	1
s	1
enough	1
and	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
obviously	1
of	1
the	1
opposition	1
he	1
said	1
words	1
evidently	1
intelligible	1
to	1
all	1
except	1
levin	1
why	1
kostya	1
you	1
here	1
too	1
i	1
suppose	1
you	1
re	1
converted	1
eh	1
he	1
added	1
turning	1
to	1
levin	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
arm	1
through	1
his	1
levin	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
indeed	1
to	1
be	1
converted	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
point	1
was	1
and	1
retreating	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
from	1
the	1
speakers	1
he	1
explained	1
to	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
his	1
inability	1
to	1
understand	1
why	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
should	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
stand	1
	1
o	1
sancta	1
simplicitas	1
	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
and	1
briefly	1
and	1
clearly	1
he	1
explained	1
it	1
to	1
levin	1
if	1
as	1
at	1
previous	1
elections	1
all	1
the	1
districts	1
asked	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
to	1
stand	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
elected	1
without	1
a	1
ballot	1
that	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
now	1
eight	1
districts	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
if	1
two	1
refused	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
snetkov	1
might	1
decline	1
to	1
stand	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
old	1
party	1
might	1
choose	1
another	1
of	1
their	1
party	1
which	1
would	1
throw	1
them	1
completely	1
out	1
in	1
their	1
reckoning	1
but	1
if	1
only	1
one	1
district	1
sviazhsky	1
s	1
did	1
not	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
stand	1
snetkov	1
would	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
balloted	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
even	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
going	1
to	1
vote	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
purposely	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
votes	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
might	1
be	1
thrown	1
off	1
the	1
scent	1
and	1
when	1
a	1
candidate	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
was	1
put	1
up	1
they	1
too	1
might	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
votes	1
levin	1
understood	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
but	1
not	1
fully	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
put	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
questions	1
when	1
suddenly	1
everyone	1
began	1
talking	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
noise	1
and	1
they	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
big	1
room	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
eh	1
whom	1
no	1
guarantee	1
whose	1
what	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
pass	1
him	1
no	1
guarantee	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
let	1
flerov	1
in	1
eh	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
charge	1
against	1
him	1
why	1
at	1
this	1
rate	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
admit	1
anyone	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
swindle	1
the	1
law	1
levin	1
heard	1
exclamations	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
big	1
room	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
others	1
all	1
hurrying	1
somewhere	1
and	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
something	1
squeezed	1
by	1
the	1
crowding	1
noblemen	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
high	1
table	1
where	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
leaders	1
were	1
hotly	1
disputing	1
about	1
something	1
chapter	1
28	1
levin	1
was	1
standing	1
rather	1
far	1
off	1
a	1
nobleman	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
and	1
hoarsely	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
another	1
whose	1
thick	1
boots	1
were	1
creaking	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
hearing	1
distinctly	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
hear	1
the	1
soft	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
faintly	1
then	1
the	1
shrill	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
sviazhsky	1
they	1
were	1
disputing	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
interpretation	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
the	1
exact	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
up	1
for	1
trial	1
the	1
crowd	1
parted	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
approaching	1
the	1
table	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
waiting	1
till	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
best	1
solution	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
refer	1
to	1
the	1
act	1
itself	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
secretary	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
act	1
the	1
act	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
ballot	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
read	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
its	1
meaning	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
a	1
tall	1
stout	1
round	1
shouldered	1
landowner	1
with	1
dyed	1
whiskers	1
in	1
a	1
tight	1
uniform	1
that	1
cut	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
neck	1
interrupted	1
him	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
striking	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
ring	1
he	1
shouted	1
loudly	1
a	1
ballot	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
vote	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
more	1
talking	1
then	1
several	1
voices	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
nobleman	1
with	1
the	1
ring	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
exasperated	1
shouted	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
loudly	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
shouting	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
course	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
had	1
proposed	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
hated	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
party	1
and	1
this	1
feeling	1
of	1
hatred	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
and	1
roused	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
same	1
vindictiveness	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
seemly	1
form	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
shouts	1
were	1
raised	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
all	1
was	1
confusion	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
had	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
order	1
a	1
ballot	1
a	1
ballot	1
every	1
nobleman	1
sees	1
it	1
we	1
shed	1
our	1
blood	1
for	1
our	1
country	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
monarch	1
no	1
checking	1
the	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
cashier	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
point	1
votes	1
please	1
beastly	1
shouted	1
furious	1
and	1
violent	1
voices	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
looks	1
and	1
faces	1
were	1
even	1
more	1
violent	1
and	1
furious	1
than	1
their	1
words	1
they	1
expressed	1
the	1
most	1
implacable	1
hatred	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
he	1
marveled	1
at	1
the	1
passion	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
disputed	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
decision	1
about	1
flerov	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
vote	1
he	1
forgot	1
as	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
afterwards	1
this	1
syllogism	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
votes	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
votes	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
secure	1
flerov	1
s	1
right	1
to	1
vote	1
that	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
flerov	1
s	1
right	1
to	1
vote	1
they	1
must	1
decide	1
on	1
the	1
interpretation	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
one	1
vote	1
may	1
decide	1
the	1
whole	1
question	1
and	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
serious	1
and	1
consecutive	1
if	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
in	1
public	1
life	1
concluded	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
but	1
levin	1
forgot	1
all	1
that	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
painful	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
these	1
excellent	1
persons	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
respect	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
vicious	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
painful	1
feeling	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
room	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
except	1
the	1
waiters	1
at	1
the	1
refreshment	1
bar	1
seeing	1
the	1
waiters	1
busy	1
over	1
washing	1
up	1
the	1
crockery	1
and	1
setting	1
in	1
order	1
their	1
plates	1
and	1
wine	1
glasses	1
seeing	1
their	1
calm	1
and	1
cheerful	1
faces	1
levin	1
felt	1
an	1
unexpected	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
stuffy	1
room	1
into	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
he	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
looking	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
waiters	1
he	1
particularly	1
liked	1
the	1
way	1
one	1
gray	1
whiskered	1
waiter	1
who	1
showed	1
his	1
scorn	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
younger	1
ones	1
and	1
was	1
jeered	1
at	1
by	1
them	1
was	1
teaching	1
them	1
how	1
to	1
fold	1
up	1
napkins	1
properly	1
levin	1
was	1
just	1
about	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
waiter	1
when	1
the	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
wardship	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
whose	1
specialty	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
noblemen	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
by	1
name	1
and	1
patronymic	1
drew	1
him	1
away	1
please	1
come	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
he	1
said	1
your	1
brother	1
s	1
looking	1
for	1
you	1
they	1
are	1
voting	1
on	1
the	1
legal	1
point	1
levin	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
received	1
a	1
white	1
ball	1
and	1
followed	1
his	1
brother	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
sviazhsky	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
and	1
ironical	1
face	1
holding	1
his	1
beard	1
in	1
his	1
fist	1
and	1
sniffing	1
at	1
it	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
box	1
put	1
the	1
ball	1
somewhere	1
and	1
making	1
room	1
for	1
levin	1
stopped	1
levin	1
advanced	1
but	1
utterly	1
forgetting	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
much	1
embarrassed	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
with	1
the	1
question	1
where	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
he	1
asked	1
this	1
softly	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
talking	1
going	1
on	1
near	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
his	1
question	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
overheard	1
but	1
the	1
persons	1
speaking	1
paused	1
and	1
his	1
improper	1
question	1
was	1
overheard	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
frowned	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
for	1
each	1
man	1
s	1
own	1
decision	1
he	1
said	1
severely	1
several	1
people	1
smiled	1
levin	1
crimsoned	1
hurriedly	1
thrust	1
his	1
hand	1
under	1
the	1
cloth	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
ball	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
having	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
he	1
recollected	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
thrust	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
too	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
thrust	1
it	1
in	1
though	1
too	1
late	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
overcome	1
with	1
confusion	1
he	1
beat	1
a	1
hasty	1
retreat	1
into	1
the	1
background	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
six	1
for	1
admission	1
ninety	1
eight	1
against	1
sang	1
out	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
secretary	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
pronounce	1
the	1
letter	1
r	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
laugh	1
a	1
button	1
and	1
two	1
nuts	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
box	1
the	1
nobleman	1
was	1
allowed	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
vote	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
party	1
had	1
conquered	1
but	1
the	1
old	1
party	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
themselves	1
conquered	1
levin	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
asking	1
snetkov	1
to	1
stand	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
noblemen	1
was	1
surrounding	1
the	1
marshal	1
who	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
levin	1
went	1
nearer	1
in	1
reply	1
snetkov	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
trust	1
the	1
noblemen	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
had	1
placed	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
affection	1
they	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
deserve	1
as	1
his	1
only	1
merit	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
nobility	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
devoted	1
twelve	1
years	1
of	1
service	1
several	1
times	1
he	1
repeated	1
the	1
words	1
i	1
have	1
served	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
powers	1
with	1
truth	1
and	1
good	1
faith	1
i	1
value	1
your	1
goodness	1
and	1
thank	1
you	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
from	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
choked	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
whether	1
these	1
tears	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
being	1
done	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
the	1
nobility	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
he	1
was	1
placed	1
in	1
feeling	1
himself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
enemies	1
his	1
emotion	1
infected	1
the	1
assembly	1
the	1
majority	1
were	1
touched	1
and	1
levin	1
felt	1
a	1
tenderness	1
for	1
snetkov	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
jostled	1
against	1
levin	1
beg	1
pardon	1
excuse	1
me	1
please	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
stranger	1
but	1
recognizing	1
levin	1
he	1
smiled	1
timidly	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
for	1
emotion	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
figure	1
in	1
his	1
uniform	1
with	1
the	1
crosses	1
and	1
white	1
trousers	1
striped	1
with	1
braid	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
hurriedly	1
along	1
reminded	1
levin	1
of	1
some	1
hunted	1
beast	1
who	1
sees	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
evil	1
case	1
this	1
expression	1
in	1
the	1
marshal	1
s	1
face	1
was	1
particularly	1
touching	1
to	1
levin	1
because	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
about	1
his	1
trustee	1
business	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
grandeur	1
a	1
kind	1
hearted	1
fatherly	1
man	1
the	1
big	1

with	1

dirty	1
far	1
from	1
stylish	1
but	1
respectful	1
footmen	1
unmistakably	1

serfs	1
who	1
had	1
stuck	1
to	1
their	1
master	1
the	1
stout	1
good	1
natured	1
wife	1
in	1
a	1
cap	1
with	1

coming	1
home	1
from	1

and	1

his	1

kissing	1
his	1
big	1
hand	1
the	1
genuine	1
cordial	1
words	1
and	1
gestures	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
roused	1
an	1
instinctive	1
feeling	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
sympathy	1
in	1
levin	1
this	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
a	1
touching	1
and	1
pathetic	1
figure	1
to	1
levin	1
now	1
and	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
you	1

sure	1
to	1
be	1

the	1

flerov	1

had	1
also	1
gained	1
time	1
for	1

that	1

could	1
send	1
to	1
fetch	1
three	1
noblemen	1

answered	1
with	1
a	1
resigned	1
smile	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
serenity	1
and	1
conviction	1
that	1
so	1

must	1
be	1

how	1

there	1
s	1
no	1

at	1
all	1

that	1

its	1
time	1
that	1
it	1

of	1
duty	1

to	1

i	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
the	1
landowner	1
pursued	1
a	1
neighbor	1
of	1
mine	1
a	1
merchant	1
was	1
at	1
my	1
place	1
we	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
the	1
garden	1
no	1

he	1
stepan	1
vassilievitch	1
everything	1
s	1
well	1
looked	1
after	1
but	1
your	1
garden	1
s	1
neglected	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
fact	1
it	1
s	1
well	1
kept	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
thinking	1
i	1
d	1
cut	1
down	1
that	1
lime	1
tree	1
here	1
you	1
ve	1
thousands	1
of	1
limes	1
and	1
each	1
would	1
make	1
two	1
good	1
bundles	1
of	1
bark	1
and	1
nowadays	1
that	1
bark	1
s	1
worth	1
something	1
i	1
d	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
lot	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
made	1
he	1
d	1
increase	1
his	1
stock	1
or	1
buy	1
some	1
land	1
for	1
a	1
trifle	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
in	1
lots	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
levin	1
added	1
smiling	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
come	1
across	1
those	1
commercial	1
calculations	1
and	1
he	1
d	1
make	1
his	1
fortune	1
but	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
thank	1
god	1
if	1
we	1
keep	1
what	1
we	1
ve	1
got	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
our	1
children	1
you	1
re	1
married	1
i	1
ve	1
heard	1
said	1
the	1
landowner	1
yes	1
levin	1
answered	1
with	1
proud	1
satisfaction	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
rather	1
strange	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
so	1
we	1
live	1
without	1
making	1
anything	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
were	1
ancient	1
vestals	1
set	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
a	1
fire	1
the	1
landowner	1
chuckled	1
under	1
his	1
white	1
mustaches	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
among	1
us	1
too	1
like	1
our	1
friend	1
nikolay	1
ivanovitch	1
or	1
count	1
vronsky	1
that	1
s	1
settled	1
here	1
lately	1
who	1
try	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
their	1
husbandry	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
factory	1
but	1
so	1
far	1
it	1
leads	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
making	1
away	1
with	1
capital	1
on	1
it	1
but	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
do	1
like	1
the	1
merchants	1
why	1
don	1
t	1
we	1
cut	1
down	1
our	1
parks	1
for	1
timber	1
said	1
levin	1
returning	1
to	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
had	1
struck	1
him	1
why	1
as	1
you	1
said	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
besides	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
work	1
for	1
a	1
nobleman	1
and	1
our	1
work	1
as	1
noblemen	1
isn	1
t	1
done	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
elections	1
but	1
yonder	1
each	1
in	1
our	1
corner	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
class	1
instinct	1
too	1
of	1
what	1
one	1
ought	1
and	1
oughtn	1
t	1
to	1
do	1
there	1
s	1
the	1
peasants	1
too	1
i	1
wonder	1
at	1
them	1
sometimes	1
any	1
good	1
peasant	1
tries	1
to	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
he	1
can	1
however	1
bad	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
he	1
ll	1
work	1
it	1
without	1
a	1
return	1
too	1
at	1
a	1
simple	1
loss	1
just	1
as	1
we	1

we	1

a	1

sviazhsky	1
took	1
levin	1
s	1
arm	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
friends	1
this	1
time	1

avoiding	1
vronsky	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
looking	1
straight	1
at	1
levin	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
delighted	1
i	1
believe	1
i	1
ve	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
meeting	1
you	1
at	1
princess	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
s	1
he	1
said	1
giving	1
levin	1
his	1
hand	1
yes	1
i	1
quite	1
remember	1
our	1
meeting	1
said	1
levin	1
and	1
blushing	1
crimson	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
immediately	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile	1
vronsky	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
to	1
sviazhsky	1
obviously	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
inclination	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
levin	1
but	1
levin	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
continually	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
vronsky	1
trying	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
gloss	1
over	1
his	1
rudeness	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
waiting	1
for	1
now	1
asked	1
levin	1
looking	1
at	1
sviazhsky	1
and	1
vronsky	1
for	1
snetkov	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
refuse	1
or	1
to	1
consent	1
to	1
stand	1
answered	1
sviazhsky	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
he	1
done	1
consented	1
or	1
not	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
point	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
done	1
neither	1
said	1
vronsky	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
refuses	1
who	1
will	1
stand	1
then	1
asked	1
levin	1
looking	1
at	1
vronsky	1
whoever	1
chooses	1
to	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
shall	1
you	1
asked	1
levin	1
certainly	1
not	1
i	1
said	1
sviazhsky	1
looking	1
confused	1
and	1
turning	1
an	1
alarmed	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
who	1
then	1
nevyedovsky	1
said	1
levin	1
feeling	1
he	1
was	1
putting	1
his	1
foot	1
into	1
it	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
worse	1
still	1
nevyedovsky	1
and	1
sviazhsky	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
candidates	1
i	1
certainly	1
shall	1
not	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
answered	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
this	1
was	1
nevyedovsky	1
himself	1
sviazhsky	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
levin	1
well	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
exciting	1
too	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
winking	1
at	1
vronsky	1
it	1
s	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
race	1
one	1
might	1
bet	1
on	1
it	1
yes	1
it	1
is	1
keenly	1
exciting	1
said	1
vronsky	1
and	1
once	1
taking	1
the	1
thing	1
up	1
one	1
s	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
through	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
fight	1
he	1
said	1
scowling	1
and	1
setting	1
his	1
powerful	1
jaws	1
what	1
a	1
capable	1
fellow	1
sviazhsky	1
is	1
sees	1
it	1
all	1
so	1
clearly	1
oh	1
yes	1
vronsky	1
assented	1
indifferently	1
a	1
silence	1
followed	1
during	1
which	1
vronsky	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
something	1
looked	1
at	1
levin	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
at	1
his	1
uniform	1
then	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
noticing	1
his	1
gloomy	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
living	1
constantly	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
one	1
it	1
s	1
because	1
i	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
is	1
a	1
silly	1
institution	1
levin	1
answered	1
gloomily	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
looking	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
vronsky	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
his	1
rudeness	1
at	1
their	1
first	1
meeting	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
so	1

over	1
thirty	1

all	1
this	1
was	1
utterly	1
uncalled	1
for	1

levin	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
big	1
room	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
vaguely	1
conscious	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
some	1
trap	1
being	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
called	1
upon	1
by	1
all	1
to	1
stand	1
had	1
still	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
stand	1
all	1
was	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
secretary	1
announced	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
that	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
mihail	1
stepanovitch	1
snetkov	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
balloted	1
for	1
as	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
the	1
district	1
marshals	1
walked	1
carrying	1
plates	1
on	1
which	1
were	1
balls	1
from	1
their	1
tables	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
election	1
began	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
whispered	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
as	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
levin	1
followed	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
his	1
district	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
but	1
levin	1
had	1
forgotten	1
by	1
now	1
the	1
calculations	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
might	1
be	1
mistaken	1
in	1
saying	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
surely	1
snetkov	1
was	1
the	1
enemy	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
but	1
thinking	1
he	1
was	1
wrong	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
box	1
he	1
changed	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
and	1
undoubtedly	1
put	1
the	1
ball	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
an	1
adept	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
seeing	1
by	1
the	1
mere	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
elbow	1
where	1
each	1
put	1
his	1
ball	1
scowled	1
with	1
annoyance	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
insight	1
everything	1
was	1
still	1
and	1
the	1
counting	1
of	1
the	1
balls	1
was	1
heard	1
then	1
a	1
single	1
voice	1
rose	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
the	1
numbers	1
for	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
marshal	1

been	1
voted	1
for	1
by	1
a	1
considerable	1
majority	1
all	1
was	1
noise	1
and	1
eager	1
movement	1
towards	1
the	1
doors	1
snetkov	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
the	1
nobles	1
thronged	1
round	1
him	1
congratulating	1
him	1
well	1
now	1

over	1

ivanovitch	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
some	1
other	1
candidate	1
may	1
receive	1
more	1
votes	1
than	1
the	1
marshal	1
levin	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
about	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
remember	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
trickery	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
bored	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
exactly	1
he	1
felt	1
depressed	1
and	1
longed	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
paying	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
apparently	1
needed	1
him	1
he	1
quietly	1
slipped	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
refreshments	1
were	1
and	1
again	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
sense	1
of	1
comfort	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
waiters	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
waiter	1
pressed	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
something	1
and	1
levin	1
agreed	1
after	1
eating	1
a	1
cutlet	1
with	1
beans	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
waiters	1
of	1
their	1
former	1
masters	1
levin	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
distasteful	1
to	1
him	1
proceeded	1
to	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
galleries	1
the	1
galleries	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
fashionably	1
dressed	1
ladies	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
balustrade	1
and	1
trying	1
not	1

officers	1
everywhere	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
election	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
worried	1
the	1
marshal	1
was	1
and	1
how	1
splendid	1

over	1

looking	1
and	1
listening	1
all	1
the	1
noblemen	1

sitting	1

off	1
behind	1
barriers	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
districts	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
uniform	1
who	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
high	1
voice	1
as	1
a	1
candidate	1
for	1

a	1

boyish	1
voice	1
replied	1
again	1

began	1
and	1
again	1
declined	1

so	1
it	1
went	1
on	1
for	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
levin	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
balustrade	1
looked	1
and	1
listened	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
wondered	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
then	1
feeling	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
bored	1
then	1
recalling	1
all	1
the	1
excitement	1
and	1
vindictiveness	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1

felt	1
sad	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1

went	1
downstairs	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1

to	1
the	1

met	1
a	1
dejected	1
high	1

walking	1
up	1

down	1
with	1
tired	1
looking	1
eyes	1
on	1

just	1
feeling	1
in	1
his	1
waistcoat	1

for	1

number	1
of	1

stoutly	1
denied	1

up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1

locked	1

knocked	1
the	1
door	1

by	1
two	1
red	1

gentlemen	1

face	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1

poked	1
out	1

face	1

dreadful	1
looking	1
from	1
exhaustion	1
and	1
dismay	1
i	1
told	1

on	1

and	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
sigh	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
walked	1
with	1
downcast	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
his	1
legs	1
staggering	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
trousers	1
nevyedovsky	1
had	1
scored	1
a	1
higher	1
majority	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
planned	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
new	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
many	1
people	1
were	1
amused	1
many	1
were	1
pleased	1
and	1
happy	1
many	1
were	1
in	1
ecstasies	1
many	1
were	1
disgusted	1
and	1
unhappy	1
the	1
former	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
despair	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceal	1
when	1
nevyedovsky	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
crowd	1
thronged	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
followed	1
him	1
enthusiastically	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
followed	1
the	1
governor	1
who	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
meetings	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
followed	1
snetkov	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
elected	1
chapter	1
31	1
the	1
newly	1
elected	1
marshal	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
successful	1
party	1
dined	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
vronsky	1
vronsky	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
elections	1
partly	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
bored	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
show	1
anna	1
his	1
right	1
to	1
independence	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
repay	1
sviazhsky	1
by	1
his	1
support	1
at	1
the	1
election	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
trouble	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
for	1
vronsky	1
at	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
election	1
but	1
chiefly	1
in	1
order	1
strictly	1
to	1
perform	1
all	1
those	1
duties	1
of	1
a	1
nobleman	1
and	1
landowner	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
upon	1
himself	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
expected	1
that	1
the	1
election	1
would	1
so	1
interest	1
him	1
so	1
keenly	1
excite	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
at	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
new	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
but	1
his	1
success	1
was	1
unmistakable	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
wrong	1
in	1
supposing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
obtained	1
a	1
certain	1
influence	1
this	1
influence	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
reputation	1
the	1
capital	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
lent	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
shirkov	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
the	1
department	1
of	1
finances	1
and	1
was	1
director	1
of	1
a	1
flourishing	1
bank	1
in	1
kashin	1
the	1
excellent	1
cook	1
vronsky	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
his	1
friendship	1
with	1
the	1
governor	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
schoolfellow	1
of	1
vronsky	1
s	1
a	1
schoolfellow	1
he	1
had	1
patronized	1
and	1
protected	1
indeed	1
but	1
what	1
contributed	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
to	1
his	1
success	1
was	1
his	1
direct	1
equable	1
manner	1
with	1
everyone	1
which	1
very	1
quickly	1
made	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
noblemen	1
reverse	1
the	1
current	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
supposed	1
haughtiness	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
conscious	1
that	1
except	1
that	1
whimsical	1
gentleman	1
married	1
to	1
kitty	1
shtcherbatskaya	1
who	1
had	1
à	1

de	1

poured	1
out	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
irrelevant	1
absurdities	1
with	1
such	1
spiteful	1
fury	1
every	1
nobleman	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
acquaintance	1
had	1
become	1
his	1
adherent	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
recognized	1
it	1
too	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
nevyedovsky	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
table	1
celebrating	1
nevyedovsky	1
s	1
election	1
he	1
was	1
experiencing	1
an	1
agreeable	1
sense	1
of	1
triumph	1
over	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
his	1
candidate	1
the	1
election	1
itself	1
had	1
so	1
fascinated	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
succeed	1
in	1
getting	1
married	1
during	1
the	1
next	1
three	1
years	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
standing	1
himself	1
much	1
as	1
after	1
winning	1
a	1
race	1
ridden	1
by	1
a	1
jockey	1
he	1
had	1
longed	1
to	1
ride	1
a	1
race	1
himself	1
today	1
he	1
was	1
celebrating	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
his	1
jockey	1
vronsky	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
sat	1
the	1
young	1
governor	1
a	1
general	1
of	1
high	1
rank	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
who	1
had	1
solemnly	1
opened	1
the	1
elections	1
with	1
his	1
speech	1
and	1
aroused	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
awe	1
in	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
vronsky	1
saw	1
to	1
vronsky	1
he	1
was	1
little	1
katka	1
maslov	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
nickname	1
in	1
the	1
pages	1

he	1
felt	1
to	1
be	1
shy	1

tried	1
to	1

on	1
the	1
left	1

sat	1
nevyedovsky	1
with	1
his	1
youthful	1
stubborn	1
and	1
malignant	1
face	1
with	1
him	1
vronsky	1
was	1
simple	1
and	1
deferential	1
sviazhsky	1
took	1
his	1
failure	1
very	1
light	1
heartedly	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
no	1
failure	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
himself	1
turning	1
glass	1
in	1
hand	1
to	1
nevyedovsky	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
better	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
movement	1
which	1
the	1
nobility	1
ought	1
to	1
follow	1
and	1
so	1
every	1
honest	1
person	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
today	1
s	1
success	1
and	1
was	1
rejoicing	1
over	1
it	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
glad	1
too	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
time	1
and	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
pleased	1
the	1
episode	1
of	1
the	1
elections	1
served	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
occasion	1
for	1
a	1
capital	1
dinner	1
sviazhsky	1
comically	1
imitated	1
the	1
tearful	1
discourse	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
and	1
observed	1
addressing	1
nevyedovsky	1
that	1
his	1
excellency	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
select	1
another	1
more	1
complicated	1
method	1
of	1
auditing	1
the	1
accounts	1
than	1
tears	1
another	1
nobleman	1
jocosely	1
described	1
how	1
footmen	1
in	1
stockings	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
for	1
the	1
marshal	1
s	1
ball	1
and	1
how	1
now	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
back	1
unless	1
the	1
new	1
marshal	1
would	1
give	1
a	1
ball	1
with	1
footmen	1
in	1
stockings	1
continually	1
during	1
dinner	1
they	1
said	1
of	1
nevyedovsky	1
our	1
marshal	1
and	1
your	1
excellency	1
this	1
was	1
said	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
pleasure	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
bride	1
is	1
called	1
madame	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
name	1
nevyedovsky	1
affected	1
to	1
be	1
not	1
merely	1
indifferent	1
but	1
scornful	1
of	1
this	1
appellation	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
highly	1
delighted	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
curb	1
on	1
himself	1
not	1
to	1
betray	1
the	1
triumph	1
which	1
was	1
unsuitable	1
to	1
their	1
new	1
liberal	1
tone	1
after	1
dinner	1
several	1
telegrams	1
were	1
sent	1
to	1
people	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
election	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
high	1
good	1
humor	1
sent	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
a	1
telegram	1
nevyedovsky	1
elected	1
by	1
twenty	1
votes	1
congratulations	1
tell	1
people	1
he	1
dictated	1
it	1
aloud	1
saying	1
we	1
must	1
let	1
them	1
share	1
our	1
rejoicing	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
getting	1
the	1
message	1
simply	1
sighed	1
over	1
the	1
rouble	1
wasted	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
understood	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
after	1
dinner	1
affair	1
she	1
knew	1
stiva	1
had	1
a	1
weakness	1
after	1
dining	1
for	1

	1
everything	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
excellent	1
dinner	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
not	1
from	1
russian	1
merchants	1
but	1
imported	1
direct	1
from	1
abroad	1
was	1
extremely	1
dignified	1
simple	1
and	1
enjoyable	1
the	1
party	1
some	1
twenty	1
had	1
been	1
selected	1
by	1
sviazhsky	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
more	1
active	1
new	1
liberals	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
of	1
thinking	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
clever	1
and	1
well	1
bred	1
they	1
drank	1
also	1
half	1
in	1
jest	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
director	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
amiable	1
host	1
vronsky	1
was	1
satisfied	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
so	1
pleasant	1
a	1
tone	1
in	1
the	1
provinces	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
dinner	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
lively	1
the	1
governor	1
asked	1
vronsky	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
concert	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
servians	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
had	1
been	1
getting	1
up	1
there	1
ll	1
be	1
a	1
ball	1
and	1
you	1
ll	1
see	1
the	1
belle	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
worth	1
seeing	1
really	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
line	1
vronsky	1
answered	1
he	1
liked	1
that	1
english	1
phrase	1
but	1
he	1
smiled	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
they	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
when	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
smoking	1
vronsky	1
s	1
valet	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
on	1
a	1
tray	1
from	1
vozdvizhenskoe	1
by	1
special	1
messenger	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
expression	1
astonishing	1
how	1
like	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
deputy	1
prosecutor	1
sventitsky	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guests	1
in	1
french	1
of	1
the	1
valet	1
while	1
vronsky	1
frowning	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
from	1
anna	1
before	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
knew	1
its	1
contents	1
expecting	1
the	1
elections	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
in	1
five	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
on	1
friday	1
today	1
was	1
saturday	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
letter	1
contained	1
reproaches	1
for	1
not	1
being	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
fixed	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
had	1
probably	1
not	1
reached	1
her	1
yet	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
but	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
unexpected	1
and	1
particularly	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1
annie	1
is	1
very	1
ill	1
the	1
doctor	1
says	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
inflammation	1
i	1
am	1
losing	1
my	1
head	1
all	1
alone	1
princess	1
varvara	1
is	1
no	1
help	1
but	1
a	1
hindrance	1
i	1
expected	1
you	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
and	1
yesterday	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
sending	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
and	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
come	1
myself	1
but	1
thought	1
better	1
of	1
it	1
knowing	1
you	1
would	1
dislike	1
it	1
send	1
some	1
answer	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
child	1
ill	1
yet	1
she	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
coming	1
herself	1
their	1
daughter	1
ill	1
and	1
this	1
hostile	1
tone	1
the	1
innocent	1
festivities	1
over	1
the	1
election	1
and	1
this	1
gloomy	1
burdensome	1
love	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
return	1
struck	1
vronsky	1
by	1
their	1
contrast	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
train	1
that	1
night	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
home	1
chapter	1
32	1
before	1
vronsky	1
s	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
elections	1
anna	1
had	1
reflected	1
that	1
the	1
scenes	1
constantly	1
repeated	1
between	1
them	1
each	1
time	1
he	1
left	1
home	1
might	1
only	1
make	1
him	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
instead	1
of	1
attaching	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
to	1
control	1
herself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
parting	1
with	1
composure	1
but	1
the	1
cold	1
severe	1
glance	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
had	1
wounded	1
her	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
started	1
her	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
was	1
destroyed	1
in	1
solitude	1
afterwards	1
thinking	1
over	1
that	1
glance	1
which	1
had	1
expressed	1
his	1
right	1
to	1
freedom	1
she	1
came	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
humiliation	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
when	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
chooses	1
not	1
simply	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
but	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
he	1
has	1
every	1
right	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
none	1
but	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
what	1
has	1
he	1
done	1
though	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
severe	1
expression	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
is	1
something	1
indefinable	1
impalpable	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
before	1
and	1
that	1
glance	1
means	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
glance	1
shows	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
indifference	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
felt	1
sure	1
that	1
a	1
coldness	1
was	1
beginning	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
alter	1
her	1
relations	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
before	1
only	1
by	1
love	1
and	1
by	1
charm	1
could	1
she	1
keep	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
just	1
as	1
before	1
only	1
by	1
occupation	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
by	1
morphine	1
at	1
night	1
could	1
she	1
stifle	1
the	1
fearful	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
if	1
he	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
one	1
means	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
for	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
love	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
that	1
means	1
was	1
divorce	1
and	1
marriage	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
long	1
for	1
that	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
or	1
stiva	1
approached	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
absorbed	1
in	1
such	1
thoughts	1
she	1
passed	1
five	1
days	1
without	1
him	1
the	1
five	1
days	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
elections	1
walks	1
conversation	1
with	1
princess	1
varvara	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
hospital	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
reading	1
reading	1
of	1
one	1
book	1
after	1
another	1
filled	1
up	1
her	1
time	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
coachman	1
came	1
back	1
without	1
him	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
utterly	1
incapable	1
of	1
stifling	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
there	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
her	1
little	1
girl	1
was	1
taken	1
ill	1
anna	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
her	1
but	1
even	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
distract	1
her	1
mind	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
illness	1
was	1
not	1
serious	1
however	1
hard	1
she	1
tried	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
this	1
little	1
child	1
and	1
to	1
feign	1
love	1
was	1
beyond	1
her	1
powers	1
towards	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
still	1
alone	1
anna	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
panic	1
about	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
decided	1
to	1
start	1
for	1
the	1
town	1
but	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts	1
wrote	1
him	1
the	1
contradictory	1
letter	1
that	1
vronsky	1
received	1
and	1
without	1
reading	1
it	1
through	1
sent	1
it	1
off	1
by	1
a	1
special	1
messenger	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
she	1
received	1
his	1
letter	1
and	1
regretted	1
her	1
own	1
she	1
dreaded	1
a	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
severe	1
look	1
he	1
had	1
flung	1
at	1
her	1
at	1
parting	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
not	1
dangerously	1
ill	1
but	1
still	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
anna	1
was	1
positively	1
admitting	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
relinquish	1
his	1
freedom	1
regretfully	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
let	1
him	1
weary	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
here	1
with	1
her	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
see	1
him	1
would	1
know	1
of	1
every	1
action	1
he	1
took	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
near	1
a	1
lamp	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
volume	1
of	1
taine	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
read	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
outside	1
and	1
every	1
minute	1
expecting	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
arrive	1
several	1
times	1
she	1
had	1
fancied	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
mistaken	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
heard	1
not	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels	1
but	1
the	1
coachman	1
s	1
shout	1
and	1
the	1
dull	1
rumble	1
in	1
the	1
covered	1
entry	1
even	1
princess	1
varvara	1
playing	1
patience	1
confirmed	1
this	1
and	1
anna	1
flushing	1
hotly	1
got	1
up	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
down	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
twice	1
before	1
she	1
stood	1
still	1
she	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
her	1
duplicity	1
but	1
even	1
more	1
she	1
dreaded	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
meet	1
her	1
all	1
feeling	1
of	1
wounded	1
pride	1
had	1
passed	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
displeasure	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
her	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
perfectly	1
well	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
days	1
she	1
felt	1
positively	1
vexed	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
getting	1
better	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
her	1
letter	1
was	1
sent	1
off	1
then	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
all	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
his	1
eyes	1
she	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
forgetting	1
everything	1
she	1
ran	1
joyfully	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
well	1
how	1
is	1
annie	1
he	1
said	1
timidly	1
from	1
below	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
anna	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
a	1
footman	1
was	1
pulling	1
off	1
his	1
warm	1
over	1
boot	1
oh	1
she	1
is	1
better	1
and	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
shaking	1
himself	1
she	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
both	1
of	1
hers	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
waist	1
never	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
well	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
he	1
said	1
coldly	1
scanning	1
her	1
her	1
hair	1
her	1
dress	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
was	1
charming	1
but	1
how	1
many	1
times	1
it	1
had	1
charmed	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
stern	1
stony	1
expression	1
that	1
she	1
so	1
dreaded	1
settled	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
well	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
and	1
are	1
you	1
well	1
he	1
said	1
wiping	1
his	1
damp	1
beard	1
with	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
never	1
mind	1
she	1
thought	1
only	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
here	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
s	1
here	1
he	1
cannot	1
he	1
dare	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
me	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
happily	1
and	1
gaily	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
princess	1
varvara	1
who	1
complained	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
anna	1
had	1
been	1
taking	1
morphine	1
in	1
his	1
absence	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
do	1
i	1
couldn	1
t	1
sleep	1
my	1
thoughts	1
prevented	1
me	1
when	1
he	1
s	1
here	1
i	1
never	1
take	1
it	1
hardly	1
ever	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
election	1
and	1
anna	1
knew	1
how	1
by	1
adroit	1
questions	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
what	1
gave	1
him	1
most	1
pleasure	1
his	1
own	1
success	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
cheerful	1
description	1
but	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
anna	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
regained	1
complete	1
possession	1
of	1
him	1
wanted	1
to	1
erase	1
the	1
painful	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
glance	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
letter	1
she	1
said	1
tell	1
me	1
frankly	1
you	1
were	1
vexed	1
at	1
getting	1
my	1
letter	1
and	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
believe	1
me	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
however	1
warm	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
forgiven	1
her	1
for	1
that	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
first	1
annie	1
ill	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
thought	1
of	1
coming	1
yourself	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
truth	1
oh	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
doubt	1
it	1
yes	1
you	1
do	1
doubt	1
it	1
you	1
are	1

i	1
see	1
not	1
for	1
one	1
moment	1
i	1
m	1
only	1
vexed	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
seem	1
somehow	1
unwilling	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
duties	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
concert	1
but	1
we	1
won	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
why	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
i	1
only	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
matters	1
of	1
real	1
importance	1
may	1
turn	1
up	1
now	1
for	1
instance	1
i	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
moscow	1
to	1

about	1
the	1

t	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
live	1
without	1
you	1
if	1
so	1
said	1
anna	1
her	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
changing	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
sick	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
yes	1
you	1
will	1
come	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
as	1
men	1
do	1
anna	1
that	1
s	1
cruel	1
i	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
my	1
whole	1
life	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him	1
if	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
moscow	1
i	1
will	1
go	1
too	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
stay	1
here	1
either	1
we	1
must	1
separate	1
or	1
else	1
live	1
together	1
why	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
s	1
my	1
one	1
desire	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
get	1
a	1
divorce	1
i	1
will	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
see	1
i	1

go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
moscow	1
you	1
talk	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
threatening	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
desire	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
from	1
you	1
said	1
vronsky	1
smiling	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
there	1
gleamed	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
cold	1
look	1
but	1
the	1
vindictive	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
persecuted	1
and	1
made	1
cruel	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
look	1
and	1
correctly	1
divined	1
its	1
meaning	1
if	1
so	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
calamity	1
that	1
glance	1
told	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
impression	1
but	1
she	1
never	1
forgot	1
it	1
anna	1
wrote	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
asking	1
him	1
about	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
november	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
princess	1
varvara	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
petersburg	1
she	1
went	1
with	1
vronsky	1
to	1
moscow	1
expecting	1
every	1
day	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
divorce	1

been	1
three	1
months	1
in	1
moscow	1
the	1
date	1
had	1
long	1
passed	1
on	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
trustworthy	1
calculations	1
of	1
people	1
learned	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
kitty	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
confined	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
about	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
her	1
time	1
was	1
any	1
nearer	1
than	1
two	1
months	1
ago	1
the	1
doctor	1
the	1
monthly	1
nurse	1
and	1
dolly	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
levin	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
event	1
without	1
terror	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
impatient	1
and	1
uneasy	1
kitty	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
who	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
calm	1
and	1
happy	1
she	1
was	1
distinctly	1
conscious	1
now	1
of	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
child	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
actually	1
existing	1
already	1
and	1
she	1
brooded	1
blissfully	1
over	1
this	1
feeling	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
by	1
now	1
altogether	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
herself	1
but	1
sometimes	1
lived	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
independently	1
of	1
her	1
often	1
this	1
separate	1
being	1
gave	1
her	1
pain	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
laugh	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
new	1
joy	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
she	1
loved	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
attentively	1
caring	1
for	1
her	1
so	1
entirely	1
pleasant	1
was	1
everything	1
presented	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
all	1
soon	1
be	1
over	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
wished	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
and	1
pleasanter	1
life	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
spoiled	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
this	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
not	1
here	1
as	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
she	1
liked	1
his	1
serene	1
friendly	1
and	1
hospitable	1
manner	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
he	1
seemed	1
continually	1
uneasy	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
guard	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
afraid	1
someone	1
would	1
be	1
rude	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
knowing	1
himself	1
distinctly	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
place	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
be	1
off	1
elsewhere	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
unoccupied	1
here	1
in	1
town	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
continual	1
hurry	1
as	1
though	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
something	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
others	1
she	1
knew	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
pity	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
when	1
kitty	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
society	1
as	1
one	1
sometimes	1
looks	1
at	1
those	1
one	1
loves	1
trying	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
stranger	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
impression	1
he	1
must	1
make	1
on	1
others	1
she	1
saw	1
with	1
a	1
panic	1
even	1
of	1
jealous	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
indeed	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
pitiable	1
figure	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
attractive	1
with	1
his	1
fine	1
breeding	1
his	1
rather	1
old	1
fashioned	1
reserved	1
courtesy	1
with	1
women	1
his	1
powerful	1
figure	1
and	1
striking	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
expressive	1
face	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
not	1
from	1
without	1
but	1
from	1
within	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
himself	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
she	1
could	1
define	1
his	1
condition	1
to	1
herself	1
sometimes	1
she	1
inwardly	1
reproached	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
inability	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
sometimes	1
she	1
recognized	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
hard	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
order	1
his	1
life	1
here	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
it	1
what	1
had	1
he	1
to	1
do	1
indeed	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
cards	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
club	1
spending	1
the	1
time	1
with	1
jovial	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
oblonsky	1
s	1
type	1
she	1
knew	1
now	1
what	1
that	1
meant	1
it	1
meant	1
drinking	1
and	1
going	1
somewhere	1
after	1
drinking	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
without	1
horror	1
of	1
where	1
men	1
went	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
society	1
but	1
she	1
knew	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
find	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
took	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
young	1
women	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
should	1
he	1
stay	1
at	1
home	1
with	1
her	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
but	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
liked	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
their	1
conversations	1
forever	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
subjects	1
aline	1
nadine	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
called	1
the	1
sisters	1
talks	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
must	1
bore	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
left	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
writing	1
at	1
his	1
book	1
he	1
had	1
indeed	1
attempted	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
library	1
and	1
make	1
extracts	1
and	1
look	1
up	1
references	1
for	1
his	1
book	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
did	1
nothing	1
the	1
less	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
and	1
besides	1
he	1
complained	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
too	1
much	1
about	1
his	1
book	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
consequently	1
all	1
his	1
ideas	1
about	1
it	1
were	1
muddled	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
interest	1
for	1
him	1
one	1
advantage	1
in	1
this	1
town	1
life	1
was	1
that	1
quarrels	1
hardly	1
ever	1
happened	1
between	1
them	1
here	1
in	1
town	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
their	1
conditions	1
were	1
different	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
become	1
more	1
careful	1
and	1
sensible	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
quarrels	1
in	1
moscow	1
from	1
jealousy	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
dreaded	1
when	1
they	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
one	1
event	1
an	1
event	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
both	1
from	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
did	1
indeed	1
happen	1
that	1
was	1
kitty	1
s	1
meeting	1
with	1
vronsky	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
marya	1
borissovna	1
kitty	1
s	1
godmother	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
her	1
had	1
insisted	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
kitty	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
into	1
society	1
at	1
all	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
condition	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
venerable	1
old	1
lady	1
and	1
there	1
met	1
vronsky	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
kitty	1
could	1
reproach	1
herself	1
for	1
at	1
this	1
meeting	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
she	1
recognized	1
in	1
his	1
civilian	1
dress	1
the	1
features	1
once	1
so	1
familiar	1
to	1
her	1
her	1
breath	1
failed	1
her	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
a	1
vivid	1
blush	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
overspread	1
her	1
face	1
but	1
this	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
before	1
her	1
father	1
who	1
purposely	1
began	1
talking	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
vronsky	1
had	1
finished	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
ready	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
vronsky	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
necessary	1
exactly	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
princess	1
marya	1
borissovna	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
everything	1
to	1
the	1
faintest	1
intonation	1
and	1
smile	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
approved	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
whose	1
unseen	1
presence	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
about	1
her	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
she	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
him	1
even	1
smiled	1
serenely	1
at	1
his	1
joke	1
about	1
the	1
elections	1
which	1
he	1
called	1
our	1
parliament	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
smile	1
to	1
show	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
joke	1
but	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
immediately	1
to	1
princess	1
marya	1
borissovna	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
glance	1
at	1
him	1
till	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
then	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
evidently	1
only	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
uncivil	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
saying	1
good	1
bye	1
she	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
saying	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
their	1
meeting	1
vronsky	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
by	1
his	1
special	1
warmth	1
to	1
her	1
after	1
the	1
visit	1
during	1
their	1
usual	1
walk	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
herself	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
while	1
keeping	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
all	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
feeling	1
for	1
vronsky	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
seem	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
indifferent	1
and	1
composed	1
with	1
him	1
levin	1
flushed	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
when	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
met	1
vronsky	1
at	1
princess	1
marya	1
borissovna	1
s	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
hard	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
this	1
but	1
still	1
harder	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
question	1
her	1
but	1
simply	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
you	1
weren	1
t	1
there	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
that	1
you	1
weren	1
t	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
couldn	1
t	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
natural	1
in	1
your	1
presence	1
i	1
am	1
blushing	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
much	1
much	1
more	1
she	1
said	1
blushing	1
till	1
the	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
couldn	1
t	1
see	1
through	1
a	1
crack	1
the	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
told	1
levin	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
herself	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
blushing	1
he	1
was	1
quickly	1
reassured	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
her	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
wanted	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
everything	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
detail	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
second	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
flushing	1
but	1
that	1
afterwards	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
direct	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
her	1
ease	1
as	1
with	1
any	1
chance	1
acquaintance	1
levin	1
was	1
quite	1
happy	1
again	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
now	1
behave	1
as	1
stupidly	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
the	1
election	1
but	1
would	1
try	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
met	1
vronsky	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
friendly	1
as	1
possible	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
wretched	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
man	1
almost	1
an	1
enemy	1
whom	1
it	1
s	1
painful	1
to	1
meet	1
said	1
levin	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1

to	1

when	1
he	1
came	1

levin	1

promised	1
to	1

wanted	1

at	1
his	1
watch	1
put	1
on	1
your	1
frock	1
coat	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
can	1

out	1
of	1
the	1

that	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
feel	1
positively	1
ashamed	1

such	1
a	1
horrible	1
thing	1
to	1

complete	1
outsider	1

on	1
with	1
nothing	1

and	1

kitty	1
laughed	1
why	1

before	1
you	1
were	1
married	1

way	1
of	1

won	1
t	1
i	1
ll	1
answer	1
for	1
that	1
said	1
kitty	1
looking	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
she	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
well	1
good	1
bye	1
do	1
go	1
please	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
out	1
after	1
kissing	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
hand	1
when	1
she	1
stopped	1
him	1

go	1
to	1
the	1
bank	1
and	1
get	1
some	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
no	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
she	1
held	1
his	1
hand	1
let	1
s	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
it	1
worries	1
me	1
i	1
seem	1
to	1
spend	1
nothing	1
unnecessary	1
but	1
money	1
seems	1
to	1
fly	1
away	1
simply	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
manage	1
well	1
somehow	1
oh	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
cough	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
that	1
cough	1
she	1
knew	1
well	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
intense	1
dissatisfaction	1
not	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
with	1
himself	1
he	1
certainly	1
was	1
displeased	1
not	1
at	1
so	1
much	1
money	1
being	1
spent	1
but	1
at	1
being	1
reminded	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
knowing	1
something	1
was	1
unsatisfactory	1
wanted	1
to	1
forget	1
i	1
have	1
told	1
sokolov	1
to	1
sell	1
the	1
wheat	1
and	1
to	1
borrow	1
an	1
advance	1
on	1
the	1
mill	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
money	1
enough	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
yes	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
that	1
altogether	1
oh	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
all	1
right	1
he	1
repeated	1
well	1
good	1
bye	1
darling	1
no	1
i	1
m	1
really	1
sorry	1
sometimes	1
that	1
i	1
listened	1
to	1
mamma	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
m	1
worrying	1
you	1
all	1
and	1
we	1
re	1
wasting	1
our	1
money	1

said	1
that	1
things	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
are	1
truly	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
without	1
thinking	1
simply	1
to	1
console	1
her	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
saw	1
those	1
sweet	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
questioningly	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
repeated	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
heart	1
i	1
was	1
positively	1
forgetting	1
her	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
he	1
remembered	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
them	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
come	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
soon	1

whispered	1
taking	1
her	1
two	1
hands	1
i	1
have	1
so	1
often	1
thought	1
so	1
that	1
now	1

contemptuously	1

the	1
least	1
little	1
bit	1

said	1
well	1

good	1
bye	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
levin	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
his	1
old	1
servant	1
kouzma	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
him	1
before	1
his	1
marriage	1
and	1
now	1
looked	1
after	1
their	1
household	1
in	1
town	1
beauty	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
left	1
shaft	1
horse	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
has	1
been	1
badly	1
shod	1
and	1
is	1
quite	1
lame	1
he	1
said	1
what	1
does	1
your	1
honor	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
stay	1
in	1
moscow	1
levin	1
had	1
used	1
his	1
own	1
horses	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
arrange	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
expenses	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
cheapest	1
way	1
possible	1
but	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
their	1
own	1
horses	1
came	1
dearer	1
than	1
hired	1
horses	1
and	1
they	1
still	1
hired	1
too	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
veterinary	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
bruise	1
and	1
for	1
katerina	1
alexandrovna	1
asked	1
kouzma	1
levin	1
was	1
not	1
by	1
now	1
struck	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
moscow	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
powerful	1
horses	1
put	1
into	1
a	1
heavy	1
carriage	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
carriage	1
three	1
miles	1
through	1
the	1
snowy	1
slush	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
standing	1
there	1
four	1
hours	1
paying	1
five	1
roubles	1
every	1
time	1
now	1
it	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural	1
hire	1
a	1
pair	1
for	1
our	1
carriage	1
from	1
the	1
jobmaster	1
said	1
he	1
yes	1
sir	1
and	1
so	1
simply	1
and	1
easily	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
facilities	1
of	1
town	1
life	1
levin	1
settled	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
would	1
have	1
called	1
for	1
so	1
much	1
personal	1
trouble	1
and	1
exertion	1
and	1
going	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
he	1
called	1
a	1
sledge	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
nikitsky	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
money	1
but	1
mused	1
on	1
the	1
introduction	1
that	1
awaited	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
petersburg	1
savant	1
a	1
writer	1
on	1
sociology	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
book	1
only	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
moscow	1
levin	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
expenditure	1
strange	1
to	1
one	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
unproductive	1
but	1
inevitable	1
that	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
but	1
by	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
which	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
happen	1
to	1
drunkards	1
the	1
first	1
glass	1
sticks	1
in	1
the	1
throat	1
the	1
second	1
flies	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
hawk	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
third	1
they	1
re	1
like	1
tiny	1
little	1
birds	1
when	1
levin	1
had	1
changed	1
his	1
first	1
hundred	1
rouble	1
note	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
liveries	1
for	1
his	1
footmen	1
and	1
hall	1
porter	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
reflecting	1
that	1
these	1
liveries	1
were	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
anyone	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
indubitably	1
necessary	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
amazement	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
kitty	1
when	1
he	1
suggested	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
do	1
without	1
liveries	1
that	1
these	1
liveries	1
would	1
cost	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
two	1
laborers	1
for	1
the	1
summer	1
that	1
is	1
would	1
pay	1
for	1
about	1
three	1
hundred	1
working	1
days	1
from	1
easter	1
to	1
ash	1
wednesday	1
and	1
each	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
hard	1
work	1
from	1
early	1
morning	1
to	1
late	1
evening	1
and	1
that	1
hundred	1
rouble	1
note	1
did	1
stick	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
but	1
the	1
next	1
note	1
changed	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
providing	1
a	1
dinner	1
for	1
their	1
relations	1
that	1
cost	1
twenty	1
eight	1
roubles	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
excite	1
in	1
levin	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
twenty	1
eight	1
roubles	1
meant	1
nine	1
measures	1
of	1
oats	1
which	1
men	1
would	1
with	1
groans	1
and	1
sweat	1
have	1
reaped	1
and	1
bound	1
and	1
thrashed	1
and	1
winnowed	1
and	1
sifted	1
and	1
sown	1
this	1
next	1
one	1
he	1
parted	1
with	1
more	1
easily	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
notes	1
he	1
changed	1
no	1
longer	1
aroused	1
such	1
reflections	1
and	1
they	1
flew	1
off	1
like	1
little	1
birds	1
whether	1
the	1
labor	1
devoted	1
to	1
obtaining	1
the	1
money	1
corresponded	1
to	1
the	1
pleasure	1
given	1
by	1
what	1
was	1
bought	1
with	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
consideration	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
dismissed	1
his	1
business	1
calculation	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
price	1
below	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sell	1
certain	1
grain	1
was	1
forgotten	1
too	1
the	1
rye	1
for	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
held	1
out	1
had	1
been	1
sold	1
for	1
fifty	1
kopecks	1
a	1
measure	1
cheaper	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
fetching	1
a	1
month	1
ago	1
even	1
the	1
consideration	1
that	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
expenditure	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
without	1
debt	1
that	1
even	1
had	1
no	1
force	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
was	1
essential	1
to	1
have	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
bank	1
without	1
inquiring	1
where	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
the	1
wherewithal	1
to	1
buy	1
meat	1
for	1
tomorrow	1
and	1
this	1
condition	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
bank	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
bank	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
tell	1
where	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
next	1
installment	1
and	1
this	1
it	1
was	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
kitty	1
had	1
mentioned	1
money	1
had	1
disturbed	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
drove	1
off	1
thinking	1
of	1
katavasov	1
and	1
the	1
meeting	1
with	1
metrov	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
chapter	1
3	1
levin	1
had	1
on	1
this	1
visit	1
to	1
town	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
professor	1
katavasov	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
since	1
his	1
marriage	1
he	1
liked	1
in	1
katavasov	1
the	1
clearness	1
and	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
conception	1
of	1
life	1
levin	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
clearness	1
of	1
katavasov	1
s	1
conception	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
poverty	1
of	1
his	1
nature	1
katavasov	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
disconnectedness	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
ideas	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
intellectual	1
discipline	1
but	1
levin	1
enjoyed	1
katavasov	1
s	1
clearness	1
and	1
katavasov	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
untrained	1
ideas	1
and	1
they	1
liked	1
to	1
meet	1
and	1
to	1
discuss	1
levin	1
had	1
read	1
katavasov	1
some	1
parts	1
of	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
liked	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
katavasov	1
had	1
met	1
levin	1
at	1
a	1
public	1
lecture	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
celebrated	1
metrov	1
whose	1
article	1
levin	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
liked	1
was	1
in	1
moscow	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
interested	1
by	1
what	1
katavasov	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
levin	1
s	1
work	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
tomorrow	1
at	1
eleven	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
levin	1
s	1
acquaintance	1
you	1
re	1
positively	1
a	1
reformed	1
character	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
said	1
katavasov	1
meeting	1
levin	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
thought	1
impossible	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
he	1
at	1
the	1
exact	1
time	1
well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
montenegrins	1
now	1
they	1
re	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
warriors	1
why	1
what	1
s	1
happened	1
asked	1
levin	1
katavasov	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
last	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
from	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
introduced	1
levin	1
to	1
a	1
short	1
thick	1
set	1
man	1
of	1
pleasant	1
appearance	1
this	1
was	1
metrov	1
the	1
conversation	1
touched	1
for	1
a	1
brief	1
space	1
on	1
politics	1
and	1
on	1
how	1
recent	1
events	1
were	1
looked	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
spheres	1
in	1
petersburg	1
metrov	1
repeated	1
a	1
saying	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
him	1
through	1
a	1
most	1
trustworthy	1
source	1
reported	1
as	1
having	1
been	1
uttered	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
by	1
the	1
tsar	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ministers	1
katavasov	1
had	1
heard	1
also	1
on	1
excellent	1
authority	1
that	1
the	1
tsar	1
had	1
said	1
something	1
quite	1
different	1
levin	1
tried	1
to	1
imagine	1
circumstances	1
in	1
which	1
both	1
sayings	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
uttered	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
on	1
that	1
topic	1
dropped	1
yes	1
here	1
he	1
s	1
written	1
almost	1
a	1
book	1
on	1
the	1
natural	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
laborer	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
said	1
katavasov	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
a	1
specialist	1
but	1
i	1
as	1
a	1
natural	1
science	1
man	1
was	1
pleased	1
at	1
his	1
not	1
taking	1
mankind	1
as	1
something	1
outside	1
biological	1
laws	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
seeing	1
his	1
dependence	1
on	1
his	1
surroundings	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
dependence	1
seeking	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
his	1
development	1
that	1
s	1
very	1
interesting	1
said	1
metrov	1
what	1
i	1
began	1
precisely	1
was	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
book	1
on	1
agriculture	1
but	1
studying	1
the	1
chief	1
instrument	1
of	1
agriculture	1
the	1
laborer	1
said	1
levin	1
reddening	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
coming	1
to	1
quite	1
unexpected	1
results	1
and	1
levin	1
began	1
carefully	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
feeling	1
his	1
ground	1
to	1
expound	1
his	1
views	1
he	1
knew	1
metrov	1
had	1
written	1
an	1
article	1
against	1
the	1
generally	1
accepted	1
theory	1
of	1
political	1
economy	1
but	1
to	1
what	1
extent	1
he	1
could	1
reckon	1
on	1
his	1
sympathy	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
new	1
views	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
from	1
the	1
clever	1
and	1
serene	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
learned	1
man	1
but	1
in	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
special	1
characteristics	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
laborer	1
said	1
metrov	1
in	1
his	1
biological	1
characteristics	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
placed	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
idea	1
underlying	1
this	1
question	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
explaining	1
his	1
own	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
laborer	1
has	1
a	1
quite	1
special	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
support	1
this	1
proposition	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
add	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
this	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
peasant	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
vocation	1
to	1
people	1
vast	1
unoccupied	1
expanses	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
one	1
may	1
easily	1
be	1
led	1
into	1
error	1
in	1
basing	1
any	1
conclusion	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
vocation	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
said	1
metrov	1
interrupting	1
levin	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
laborer	1
will	1
always	1
depend	1
on	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
to	1
capital	1
and	1
without	1
letting	1
levin	1
finish	1
explaining	1
his	1
idea	1
metrov	1
began	1
expounding	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
special	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
theory	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
theory	1
lay	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
to	1
understand	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
metrov	1
like	1
other	1
people	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
article	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
current	1
theory	1
of	1
political	1
economy	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
peasant	1
simply	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
capital	1
wages	1
and	1
rent	1
he	1
would	1
indeed	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
eastern	1
much	1
the	1
larger	1
part	1
of	1
russia	1
rent	1
was	1
as	1
yet	1
nil	1
that	1
for	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
the	1
eighty	1
millions	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
peasants	1
wages	1
took	1
the	1
form	1
simply	1
of	1
food	1
provided	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
that	1
capital	1
does	1
not	1
so	1
far	1
exist	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
primitive	1
tools	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
from	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
every	1
laborer	1
though	1
in	1
many	1
points	1
he	1
differed	1
from	1
the	1
economists	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
wage	1
fund	1
which	1
he	1
expounded	1
to	1
levin	1
levin	1
listened	1
reluctantly	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
made	1
objections	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
interrupt	1
metrov	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
own	1
thought	1
which	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
would	1
have	1
rendered	1
further	1
exposition	1
of	1
metrov	1
s	1
theories	1
superfluous	1
but	1
later	1
on	1
feeling	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
so	1
differently	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
never	1
understand	1
one	1
another	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
oppose	1
his	1
statements	1
but	1
simply	1
listened	1
although	1
what	1
metrov	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
by	1
now	1
utterly	1
devoid	1
of	1
interest	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
yet	1
experienced	1
a	1
certain	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
flattered	1
his	1
vanity	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
learned	1
man	1
should	1
explain	1
his	1
ideas	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
eagerly	1
with	1
such	1
intensity	1
and	1
confidence	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
sometimes	1
with	1
a	1
mere	1
hint	1
referring	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
whole	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
he	1
put	1
this	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
credit	1
unaware	1
that	1
metrov	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
discussed	1
his	1
theory	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
intimate	1
friends	1
talked	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
special	1
eagerness	1
to	1
every	1
new	1
person	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
anyone	1
of	1
any	1
subject	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
even	1
if	1
still	1
obscure	1
to	1
himself	1
we	1
are	1
late	1
though	1
said	1
katavasov	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
directly	1

finished	1

discourse	1

he	1
has	1
handed	1
in	1
the	1
separate	1
report	1
katavasov	1
called	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
frock	1
coat	1
and	1
a	1
conversation	1
sprang	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
university	1
question	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
event	1
that	1
winter	1
in	1
moscow	1
three	1
old	1
professors	1
in	1
the	1
council	1
had	1
not	1
accepted	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
professors	1
the	1
young	1
ones	1
had	1
registered	1
a	1
separate	1
resolution	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
some	1
people	1
was	1
monstrous	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
others	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
just	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
the	1
professors	1
were	1
split	1
up	1
into	1
two	1
parties	1
one	1
party	1
to	1
which	1
katavasov	1
belonged	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
party	1
a	1
scoundrelly	1
betrayal	1
and	1
treachery	1
while	1
the	1
opposite	1
party	1
saw	1
in	1
them	1
childishness	1
and	1
lack	1
of	1
respect	1
for	1
the	1
authorities	1
levin	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
university	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
already	1
during	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
moscow	1
heard	1
and	1
talked	1
about	1
this	1
matter	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
he	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
was	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
three	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
buildings	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
university	1
the	1
meeting	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
round	1
the	1
cloth	1
covered	1
table	1
at	1
which	1
katavasov	1
and	1
metrov	1
seated	1
themselves	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
half	1
dozen	1
persons	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
bending	1
close	1
over	1
a	1
manuscript	1
reading	1
something	1
aloud	1
levin	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
empty	1
chairs	1
that	1
were	1
standing	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
asked	1
a	1
student	1
sitting	1
near	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
read	1
the	1
student	1
eyeing	1
levin	1
with	1
displeasure	1
said	1
biography	1
though	1
levin	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
biography	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
listening	1
and	1
learned	1
some	1
new	1
and	1
interesting	1
facts	1
about	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
distinguished	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
when	1
the	1
reader	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
chairman	1
thanked	1
him	1
and	1
read	1
some	1
verses	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
ment	1
sent	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
jubilee	1
and	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
poet	1
then	1
katavasov	1
in	1
his	1
loud	1
ringing	1
voice	1
read	1
his	1
address	1
on	1
the	1
scientific	1
labors	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
jubilee	1
was	1
being	1
kept	1
when	1
katavasov	1
had	1
finished	1
levin	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
past	1
one	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
time	1
before	1
the	1
concert	1
to	1
read	1
metrov	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
indeed	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
care	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
during	1
the	1
reading	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
over	1
their	1
conversation	1
he	1
saw	1
distinctly	1
now	1
that	1
though	1
metrov	1
s	1
ideas	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
value	1
his	1
own	1
ideas	1
had	1
a	1
value	1
too	1
and	1
their	1
ideas	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
made	1
clear	1
and	1
lead	1
to	1
something	1
if	1
each	1
worked	1
separately	1
in	1
his	1
chosen	1
path	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
be	1
gained	1
by	1
putting	1
their	1
ideas	1
together	1
and	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
refuse	1
metrov	1
s	1
invitation	1
levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
metrov	1
introduced	1
levin	1
to	1
the	1
chairman	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
political	1
news	1
metrov	1
told	1
the	1
chairman	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
levin	1
and	1
levin	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
remarks	1
on	1
his	1
news	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
that	1
morning	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
variety	1
he	1
expressed	1
also	1
a	1
new	1
opinion	1
which	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
struck	1
him	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
turned	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
university	1
question	1
as	1
levin	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
it	1
all	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
tell	1
metrov	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
his	1
invitation	1
took	1
leave	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
lvov	1
s	1
chapter	1
4	1
lvov	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
natalia	1
kitty	1
s	1
sister	1
had	1
spent	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
foreign	1
capitals	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
service	1
during	1
the	1
previous	1
year	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
service	1
not	1
owing	1
to	1
any	1
unpleasantness	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
unpleasantness	1
with	1
anyone	1
and	1
was	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
palace	1
in	1
moscow	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
two	1
boys	1
the	1
best	1
education	1
possible	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
striking	1
contrast	1
in	1
their	1
habits	1
and	1
views	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
lvov	1
was	1
older	1
than	1
levin	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
that	1
winter	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
great	1
liking	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
lvov	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
levin	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
him	1
unannounced	1
lvov	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
belt	1
and	1
in	1
chamois	1
leather	1
shoes	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
pince	1
nez	1
with	1
blue	1
glasses	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
a	1
book	1
that	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
reading	1
desk	1
while	1
in	1
his	1
beautiful	1
hand	1
he	1
held	1
a	1
half	1
burned	1
cigarette	1
daintily	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
his	1
handsome	1
delicate	1
and	1
still	1
youthful	1
looking	1
face	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
curly	1
glistening	1
silvery	1
hair	1
gave	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
aristocratic	1
air	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
levin	1
capital	1
i	1
was	1
meaning	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
you	1
how	1

up	1

pushed	1
up	1
a	1
rocking	1
chair	1

you	1
read	1
the	1
last	1
circular	1
in	1
the	1
journal	1
de	1

	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
excellent	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
french	1
accent	1
levin	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
katavasov	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
in	1
petersburg	1
and	1
after	1
talking	1
a	1
little	1
about	1
politics	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
metrov	1
and	1
the	1
learned	1
society	1
s	1
meeting	1
to	1

very	1
interesting	1
that	1

envy	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
mix	1
in	1
these	1
interesting	1
scientific	1
circles	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
he	1
passed	1
as	1
usual	1
into	1
french	1
which	1
was	1
easier	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
it	1

official	1
work	1

time	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
own	1
that	1
my	1
education	1
has	1
been	1
too	1
defective	1
that	1
i	1
don	1
t	1

said	1
levin	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
feeling	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
touched	1
at	1
lvov	1

low	1
opinion	1
of	1
himself	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
in	1

put	1
on	1
from	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
seem	1

to	1

modest	1

was	1
absolutely	1
sincere	1
oh	1
yes	1
indeed	1
i	1
feel	1
now	1
how	1
badly	1
educated	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
educate	1
my	1
children	1
i	1
positively	1
have	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
simply	1
to	1
study	1
myself	1
for	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
have	1
teachers	1
there	1
must	1
be	1

him	1
that	1
it	1
couldn	1

that	1
it	1

to	1

would	1
not	1

with	1
him	1
oh	1

nothing	1
for	1

lvov	1
all	1
i	1

is	1
that	1
i	1

never	1

brought	1
up	1

and	1
i	1

when	1
others	1
crop	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
struggle	1
begins	1
again	1
if	1
one	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
support	1
in	1
religion	1
you	1
remember	1
we	1
talked	1
about	1
that	1
no	1
father	1
could	1
bring	1
children	1
up	1
relying	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
strength	1
alone	1
without	1
that	1
help	1
this	1
subject	1
which	1
always	1
interested	1
levin	1
was	1
cut	1
short	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
beauty	1
natalia	1
alexandrovna	1
dressed	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
here	1
she	1
said	1
unmistakably	1
feeling	1
no	1
regret	1
but	1
a	1
positive	1
pleasure	1
in	1
interrupting	1
this	1
conversation	1
on	1
a	1
topic	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
by	1
now	1
weary	1
of	1
it	1
well	1
how	1
is	1
kitty	1
i	1
am	1
dining	1
with	1
you	1
today	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
arseny	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
you	1
take	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
began	1
to	1
discuss	1
their	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
as	1
the	1
husband	1
had	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
meet	1
someone	1
on	1
official	1
business	1
while	1
the	1
wife	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
concert	1
and	1
some	1
public	1
meeting	1
of	1
a	1
committee	1
on	1
the	1
eastern	1
question	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
consider	1
and	1
settle	1
levin	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
their	1
plans	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
themselves	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
levin	1
should	1
go	1
with	1
natalia	1
to	1
the	1
concert	1
and	1
the	1
meeting	1
and	1
that	1
from	1
there	1
they	1
should	1
send	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
the	1
office	1
for	1
arseny	1
and	1
he	1
should	1
call	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
kitty	1
s	1
or	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
should	1
send	1
the	1
carriage	1
back	1
and	1
levin	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
her	1
he	1
s	1
spoiling	1
me	1
lvov	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
assures	1
me	1
that	1
our	1
children	1
are	1
splendid	1
when	1
i	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
that	1
s	1
bad	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
them	1
arseny	1
goes	1
to	1
extremes	1
i	1
always	1
say	1

his	1
wife	1
if	1
you	1
look	1
for	1
perfection	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
satisfied	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
as	1
papa	1
says	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
extreme	1
we	1
were	1
kept	1
in	1
the	1
basement	1
while	1
our	1
parents	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
rooms	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
the	1
parents	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
wash	1
house	1
while	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
rooms	1
parents	1
now	1
are	1
not	1
expected	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
to	1
exist	1
altogether	1
for	1
their	1
children	1
well	1
what	1
if	1
they	1
like	1
it	1
better	1
lvov	1
said	1
with	1
his	1
beautiful	1
smile	1
touching	1
her	1
hand	1
anyone	1
who	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
stepmother	1
not	1
a	1
true	1
mother	1
no	1
extremes	1
are	1
not	1
good	1
in	1
anything	1
natalia	1
said	1
serenely	1
putting	1
his	1
paper	1
knife	1
straight	1
in	1
its	1
proper	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
well	1
come	1
here	1
you	1
perfect	1
children	1
lvov	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
handsome	1
boys	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
after	1
bowing	1
to	1
levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
obviously	1
wishing	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
about	1
something	1
levin	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
they	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
but	1
natalia	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
lvov	1
s	1
colleague	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
mahotin	1
walked	1
in	1
wearing	1
his	1
court	1
uniform	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
meet	1
someone	1
and	1
a	1
conversation	1
was	1
kept	1
up	1
without	1
a	1
break	1
upon	1
herzegovina	1
princess	1
korzinskaya	1
the	1
town	1
council	1
and	1
the	1
sudden	1
death	1
of	1
madame	1
apraksina	1
levin	1
even	1
forgot	1
the	1
commission	1
intrusted	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
recollected	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
oh	1
kitty	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
about	1
oblonsky	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
lvov	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
seeing	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
levin	1
off	1
yes	1
yes	1
maman	1
wants	1
us	1
les	1
beaux	1
frères	1
	1
to	1
attack	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
blushing	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
i	1
well	1
then	1
i	1
will	1
attack	1
him	1
said	1
madame	1
lvova	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
standing	1
in	1
her	1
white	1
sheepskin	1
cape	1
waiting	1
till	1

had	1
finished	1

go	1
chapter	1
5	1
at	1
the	1
concert	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
two	1
very	1
interesting	1
things	1
were	1
performed	1
one	1
was	1
a	1
fantasia	1
king	1
lear	1
	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
a	1
quartette	1
dedicated	1
to	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
bach	1
both	1
were	1
new	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
style	1
and	1
levin	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
them	1
after	1
escorting	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
her	1
stall	1
he	1
stood	1
against	1
a	1
column	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
listen	1
as	1
attentively	1
and	1
conscientiously	1
as	1
possible	1
he	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
his	1
attention	1
be	1
distracted	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
spoil	1
his	1
impression	1
by	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
conductor	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
tie	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
which	1
always	1
disturbed	1
his	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
music	1
so	1
much	1
or	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
bonnets	1
with	1
strings	1
carefully	1
tied	1
over	1
their	1
ears	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
either	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
or	1
thinking	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things	1
except	1
the	1
music	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
musical	1
connoisseurs	1
or	1
talkative	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
floor	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
listening	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
fantasia	1
of	1
king	1
lear	1
the	1
further	1
he	1
felt	1
from	1
forming	1
any	1
definite	1
opinion	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
continual	1
beginning	1
a	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
musical	1
expression	1
of	1
some	1
feeling	1
but	1
it	1
fell	1
to	1
pieces	1
again	1
directly	1
breaking	1
into	1
new	1
musical	1
motives	1
or	1
simply	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
whims	1
of	1
the	1
composer	1
exceedingly	1
complex	1
but	1
disconnected	1
sounds	1
and	1
these	1
fragmentary	1
musical	1
expressions	1
though	1
sometimes	1
beautiful	1
were	1
disagreeable	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
utterly	1
unexpected	1
and	1
not	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
by	1
anything	1
gaiety	1
and	1
grief	1
and	1
despair	1
and	1
tenderness	1
and	1
triumph	1
followed	1
one	1
another	1
without	1
any	1
connection	1
like	1
the	1
emotions	1
of	1
a	1
madman	1
and	1
those	1
emotions	1
like	1
a	1
madman	1
s	1
sprang	1
up	1
quite	1
unexpectedly	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
performance	1
levin	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
deaf	1
man	1
watching	1
people	1
dancing	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
complete	1
bewilderment	1
when	1
the	1
fantasia	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
great	1
weariness	1
from	1
the	1
fruitless	1
strain	1
on	1
his	1
attention	1
loud	1
applause	1
resounded	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
everyone	1
got	1
up	1
moved	1
about	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
anxious	1
to	1
throw	1
some	1
light	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
perplexity	1
from	1
the	1
impressions	1
of	1
others	1
levin	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
about	1
looking	1
for	1
connoisseurs	1
and	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
musical	1
amateur	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
pestsov	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
marvelous	1
pestsov	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
his	1
mellow	1
bass	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
konstantin	1
dmitrievitch	1
particularly	1
sculpturesque	1
and	1
plastic	1
so	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
richly	1
colored	1
is	1
that	1
passage	1
where	1
you	1
feel	1
cordelia	1
s	1
approach	1
where	1
woman	1
das	1
ewig	1
weibliche	1
	1
enters	1
into	1
conflict	1
with	1
fate	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
has	1
cordelia	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
levin	1
asked	1
timidly	1
forgetting	1
that	1
the	1
fantasia	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
represent	1
king	1
lear	1
cordelia	1
comes	1
in	1
see	1
here	1
said	1
pestsov	1
tapping	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
satiny	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
program	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
passing	1
it	1
to	1
levin	1
only	1
then	1
levin	1
recollected	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
fantasia	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
russian	1
translation	1
the	1
lines	1
from	1
shakespeare	1
that	1
were	1
printed	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
program	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
follow	1
it	1
without	1
that	1
said	1
pestsov	1
addressing	1
levin	1
as	1
the	1
person	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
speaking	1
to	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
in	1
the	1
entr	1
acte	1
levin	1
and	1
pestsov	1
fell	1
into	1
an	1
argument	1
upon	1
the	1
merits	1
and	1
defects	1
of	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
wagner	1
school	1
levin	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
mistake	1
of	1
wagner	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
followers	1
lay	1
in	1
their	1
trying	1
to	1
take	1
music	1
into	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
another	1
art	1
just	1
as	1
poetry	1
goes	1
wrong	1
when	1
it	1
tries	1
to	1
paint	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
painting	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
this	1
mistake	1
he	1
cited	1
the	1
sculptor	1
who	1
carved	1
in	1
marble	1
certain	1
poetic	1
phantasms	1
flitting	1
round	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
on	1
the	1
pedestal	1
these	1
phantoms	1
were	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
phantoms	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
positively	1
clinging	1
on	1
the	1
ladder	1
said	1
levin	1
the	1
comparison	1
pleased	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
used	1
the	1
same	1
phrase	1
before	1
and	1
to	1
pestsov	1
too	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
he	1
felt	1
confused	1
pestsov	1
maintained	1
that	1
art	1
is	1
one	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
attain	1
its	1
highest	1
manifestations	1
only	1
by	1
conjunction	1
with	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
art	1
the	1
second	1
piece	1
that	1
was	1
performed	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
pestsov	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
him	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
condemning	1
the	1
music	1
for	1
its	1
excessive	1
affected	1
assumption	1
of	1
simplicity	1
and	1
comparing	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
pre	1
raphaelites	1
in	1
painting	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
levin	1
met	1
many	1
more	1
acquaintances	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
talked	1
of	1
politics	1
of	1
music	1
and	1
of	1
common	1
acquaintances	1
among	1
others	1
he	1
met	1
count	1
bol	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
utterly	1
forgotten	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
well	1
go	1
at	1
once	1
then	1
madame	1
lvova	1
said	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
perhaps	1
they	1
ll	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
meeting	1
to	1
fetch	1
me	1
you	1
ll	1
find	1
me	1
still	1
there	1

perhaps	1

levin	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
countess	1
bola	1
s	1
house	1
at	1
home	1
please	1
walk	1
in	1
said	1
the	1
porter	1
resolutely	1
removing	1
his	1
overcoat	1
how	1
annoying	1
thought	1
levin	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
taking	1
off	1
one	1
glove	1
and	1
stroking	1
his	1
hat	1
what	1
did	1
i	1
come	1
for	1
what	1
have	1
i	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
first	1
drawing	1
room	1
levin	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
countess	1
bola	1
giving	1
some	1
order	1
to	1
a	1
servant	1
with	1
a	1
care	1
worn	1
and	1
severe	1
face	1
on	1
seeing	1
levin	1
she	1
smiled	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
heard	1
voices	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
there	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
armchairs	1
the	1
two	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
a	1
moscow	1
colonel	1
whom	1
levin	1
knew	1
levin	1
went	1
up	1
greeted	1
them	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
sofa	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
how	1
is	1
your	1
wife	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
concert	1

service	1

i	1

what	1
a	1
sudden	1
death	1
said	1
levin	1
the	1
countess	1
came	1
in	1

down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
she	1
too	1
asked	1
after	1

and	1
inquired	1
about	1

answered	1
and	1
repeated	1
an	1
inquiry	1
about	1
madame	1
apraksina	1
s	1
sudden	1
death	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
always	1

very	1
good	1
yes	1
very	1
good	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
began	1
repeating	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
about	1
the	1
characteristics	1
of	1
the	1
singer	1
s	1
talent	1
countess	1
bola	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
listening	1
then	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
enough	1
and	1
paused	1
the	1
colonel	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
silent	1
till	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
the	1
colonel	1
too	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
opera	1
and	1
about	1
culture	1
at	1
last	1
after	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
folle	1
journée	1
at	1
turin	1
s	1
the	1
colonel	1
laughed	1
got	1
up	1
noisily	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
levin	1
too	1
rose	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
time	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
he	1
must	1
stay	1
two	1
minutes	1
longer	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
how	1
stupid	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
subject	1
for	1
conversation	1
and	1
sat	1
silent	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
meeting	1
they	1
say	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
interesting	1
began	1
the	1
countess	1
no	1
i	1
promised	1
my	1
belle	1
sœur	1
to	1
fetch	1
her	1
from	1
it	1
said	1
levin	1
a	1
silence	1
followed	1
the	1
mother	1
once	1
more	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
a	1
daughter	1
well	1
now	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
thought	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
the	1
ladies	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
mille	1
choses	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
for	1
them	1
the	1
porter	1
asked	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
coat	1
where	1
is	1
your	1
honor	1
staying	1
and	1
immediately	1
wrote	1
down	1
his	1
address	1
in	1
a	1
big	1
handsomely	1
bound	1
book	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
but	1
still	1
i	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
and	1
awfully	1
stupid	1
thought	1
levin	1
consoling	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
everyone	1
does	1
it	1
he	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
meeting	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
drive	1
home	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
public	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
people	1
and	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
levin	1
was	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
as	1
everyone	1
said	1
was	1
very	1
interesting	1
when	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
report	1
was	1
over	1
people	1
moved	1
about	1
and	1
levin	1
met	1
sviazhsky	1
who	1
invited	1
him	1
very	1
pressingly	1
to	1
come	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
a	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
agriculture	1
where	1
a	1
celebrated	1
lecture	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
delivered	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
races	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
levin	1
heard	1
and	1
uttered	1
various	1
criticisms	1
on	1
the	1
meeting	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
fantasia	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
public	1
trial	1
but	1
probably	1
from	1
the	1
mental	1
fatigue	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
blunder	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
trial	1
and	1
this	1
blunder	1
he	1
recalled	1
several	1
times	1
with	1
vexation	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
sentence	1
upon	1
a	1
foreigner	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
condemned	1
in	1
russia	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
unfair	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
by	1
exile	1
abroad	1
levin	1
repeated	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
conversation	1
from	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
i	1
think	1
sending	1
him	1
abroad	1
is	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
punishing	1
a	1
carp	1
by	1
putting	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
said	1
levin	1
then	1
he	1
recollected	1
that	1
this	1
idea	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
uttered	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
fable	1
of	1
krilov	1
s	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
had	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
from	1
a	1
newspaper	1
article	1
after	1
driving	1
home	1
with	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
finding	1
kitty	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
and	1
quite	1
well	1
levin	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
chapter	1
7	1
levin	1
reached	1
the	1
club	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time	1
members	1
and	1
visitors	1
were	1
driving	1
up	1
as	1
he	1
arrived	1
levin	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
while	1
not	1
since	1
he	1
lived	1
in	1
moscow	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
society	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
club	1
the	1
external	1
details	1
of	1
its	1
arrangement	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
the	1
impression	1
it	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
driving	1
into	1
the	1
wide	1
semicircular	1
court	1
and	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sledge	1
he	1
mounted	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
adorned	1
with	1
a	1
crossway	1
scarf	1
noiselessly	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
room	1
the	1
cloaks	1
and	1
galoshes	1
of	1
members	1
who	1
thought	1
it	1
less	1
trouble	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
off	1
downstairs	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
mysterious	1
ringing	1
bell	1
that	1
preceded	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
ascended	1
the	1
easy	1
carpeted	1
staircase	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
statue	1
on	1
the	1
landing	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
porter	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
doors	1
a	1
familiar	1
figure	1
grown	1
older	1
in	1
the	1
club	1
livery	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
haste	1
or	1
delay	1
and	1
scanning	1
the	1
visitors	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
in	1
levin	1
felt	1
the	1
old	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
club	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
rush	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
repose	1
comfort	1
and	1
propriety	1
your	1
hat	1
please	1
the	1
porter	1
said	1
to	1
levin	1
who	1
forgot	1
the	1
club	1
rule	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
hat	1
in	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
room	1
long	1

not	1
only	1
know	1
levin	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
his	1
ties	1
and	1
relationships	1
and	1
so	1
immediately	1
mentioned	1
his	1
intimate	1
friends	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
outer	1
hall	1
divided	1
up	1
by	1
screens	1
and	1
the	1

on	1
the	1

where	1
a	1

at	1
the	1

overtook	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
walking	1
slowly	1
in	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
noise	1
and	1
people	1
he	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
tables	1
almost	1
all	1
full	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
visitors	1
he	1
saw	1
people	1
of	1
all	1

young	1

in	1
the	1

with	1

turovtsin	1
he	1
was	1
associated	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
with	1
memories	1
of	1
his	1
courtship	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
after	1

spread	1
with	1
spirits	1
and	1
appetizers	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
various	1
kinds	1

of	1
two	1
dozen	1
delicacies	1
one	1
might	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
one	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
asked	1
for	1
something	1
special	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
liveried	1
waiters	1
standing	1
by	1
immediately	1
brought	1
what	1
was	1
required	1

drank	1
a	1
wine	1
glassful	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1

very	1
hungry	1
and	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1

dropping	1
his	1

last	1
good	1
story	1
from	1
petersburg	1
and	1
the	1
story	1
though	1
improper	1
and	1
stupid	1
was	1
so	1
ludicrous	1
that	1
levin	1
broke	1
into	1
roars	1
of	1
laughter	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
those	1
near	1

of	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
that	1
day	1

moist	1
which	1
always	1

a	1
remarkable	1
woman	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
very	1
painful	1
especially	1
now	1
why	1
especially	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
carrying	1
on	1
negotiations	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
about	1
a	1

there	1
are	1
difficulties	1
in	1

to	1
the	1

the	1
business	1
which	1

soon	1
as	1
the	1

over	1
she	1

that	1
no	1

which	1
only	1
prevent	1

rang	1
loudly	1
at	1

without	1

walked	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
levin	1
followed	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
looking	1
at	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
levin	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
red	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
certain	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
drunk	1
and	1
he	1
followed	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
up	1
the	1
carpeted	1
stairs	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
bowed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
intimate	1
friend	1
who	1
was	1
with	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
and	1
received	1
the	1
answer	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
m	1
vorkuev	1
where	1
are	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
passing	1
through	1

a	1
room	1
not	1
very	1
large	1
with	1
dark	1
paneled	1
walls	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
and	1
levin	1
walked	1
over	1
the	1
soft	1
carpet	1
to	1
the	1
half	1
dark	1
study	1
lighted	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
lamp	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
dark	1
shade	1
another	1
lamp	1
with	1
a	1
reflector	1
was	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
lighting	1
up	1
a	1
big	1
full	1
length	1
portrait	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
which	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
anna	1
painted	1
in	1
italy	1
by	1
mihailov	1
while	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
went	1
behind	1
the	1
treillage	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
voice	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
speaking	1
paused	1
levin	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
which	1
stood	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
frame	1
in	1
the	1
brilliant	1
light	1
thrown	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
himself	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
he	1
positively	1
forgot	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
not	1
even	1
hearing	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
marvelous	1
portrait	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
picture	1
but	1
a	1
living	1
charming	1
woman	1
with	1
black	1
curling	1
hair	1
with	1
bare	1
arms	1
and	1
shoulders	1
with	1
a	1
pensive	1
smile	1
on	1
the	1
lips	1
covered	1
with	1
soft	1
down	1
triumphantly	1
and	1
softly	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
baffled	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
living	1
only	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
a	1
living	1
woman	1
can	1
be	1
i	1
am	1
delighted	1
he	1
heard	1
suddenly	1
near	1
him	1
a	1
voice	1
unmistakably	1
addressing	1
him	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
admiring	1
in	1
the	1
portrait	1
anna	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
treillage	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
levin	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
the	1
very	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
portrait	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
blue	1
shot	1
gown	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
nor	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
perfection	1
of	1
beauty	1
which	1
the	1
artist	1
had	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
portrait	1
she	1
was	1
less	1
dazzling	1
in	1
reality	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
fresh	1
and	1
seductive	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
woman	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
portrait	1
chapter	1
10	1
she	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
not	1
concealing	1
her	1
pleasure	1
at	1
seeing	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
quiet	1
ease	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
little	1
vigorous	1
hand	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
vorkuev	1
and	1
indicated	1
a	1
red	1
haired	1
pretty	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
work	1
calling	1
her	1
her	1
pupil	1
levin	1
recognized	1
and	1
liked	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
world	1
always	1
self	1
possessed	1
and	1
natural	1
i	1
am	1
delighted	1
delighted	1
she	1
repeated	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
lips	1
these	1
simple	1
words	1
took	1
for	1
levin	1
s	1
ears	1
a	1
special	1
significance	1
i	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
and	1
liked	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
both	1
from	1
your	1
friendship	1
with	1
stiva	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
wife	1
s	1
sake	1
i	1
knew	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
but	1
she	1
left	1
on	1
me	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
an	1
exquisite	1
flower	1
simply	1
a	1
flower	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
she	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
a	1
mother	1
she	1
spoke	1
easily	1
and	1
without	1
haste	1
looking	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
from	1
levin	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
levin	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
impression	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
immediately	1
at	1
home	1
simple	1
and	1
happy	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
from	1
childhood	1
ivan	1
petrovitch	1
and	1
i	1
settled	1
in	1
alexey	1
s	1
study	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
might	1
smoke	1
just	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
smoke	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
levin	1
instead	1
of	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
smoke	1
she	1
pulled	1
closer	1
a	1
tortoise	1
shell	1
cigar	1
case	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
cigarette	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
feeling	1
today	1
her	1
brother	1
asked	1
her	1
oh	1
nothing	1
nerves	1
as	1
usual	1
yes	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
extraordinarily	1
fine	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
noticing	1
that	1
levin	1
was	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
picture	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
better	1
portrait	1
and	1
extraordinarily	1
like	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
said	1
vorkuev	1
levin	1
looked	1
from	1
the	1
portrait	1
to	1
the	1
original	1
a	1
peculiar	1
brilliance	1
lighted	1
up	1
anna	1
s	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
felt	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
her	1
levin	1
flushed	1
and	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
confusion	1
would	1
have	1
asked	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
lately	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
anna	1
spoke	1
we	1
were	1
just	1
talking	1
ivan	1
petrovitch	1
and	1
i	1
of	1
vashtchenkov	1
s	1
last	1
pictures	1
have	1
you	1
seen	1
them	1
yes	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
answered	1
levin	1
but	1
i	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
i	1
interrupted	1
you	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
levin	1
asked	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
dolly	1
lately	1
she	1
was	1
here	1
yesterday	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
indignant	1
with	1
the	1
high	1
school	1
people	1
on	1
grisha	1
s	1
account	1
the	1
latin	1
teacher	1
it	1
seems	1
had	1
been	1
unfair	1
to	1
him	1
yes	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
pictures	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
them	1
very	1
much	1
levin	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
she	1
had	1
started	1
levin	1
talked	1
now	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
with	1
that	1
purely	1
businesslike	1
attitude	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
every	1
word	1
in	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
had	1
a	1
special	1
significance	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
pleasant	1
still	1
pleasanter	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
her	1
anna	1
talked	1
not	1
merely	1
naturally	1
and	1
cleverly	1
but	1
cleverly	1
and	1
carelessly	1
attaching	1
no	1
value	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
ideas	1
and	1
giving	1
great	1
weight	1
to	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
movement	1
in	1

on	1
the	1
new	1
illustrations	1
of	1
the	1
bible	1
by	1
a	1
french	1
artist	1
vorkuev	1
attacked	1
the	1
artist	1
for	1
a	1
realism	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
coarseness	1
levin	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
french	1
had	1
carried	1
conventionality	1
further	1
than	1
anyone	1
and	1
that	1
consequently	1
they	1
see	1
a	1
great	1
merit	1
in	1
the	1
return	1
to	1
realism	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
not	1
lying	1
they	1
see	1
poetry	1
never	1
had	1
anything	1
clever	1
said	1
by	1
levin	1
given	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
pleasure	1
as	1
this	1
remark	1
anna	1
s	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
appreciated	1
the	1

she	1
laughed	1

she	1
said	1
as	1
one	1
laughs	1
when	1
one	1
sees	1
a	1
very	1
true	1
portrait	1
what	1
you	1
said	1
so	1
perfectly	1
hits	1
off	1
french	1
art	1
now	1
painting	1
and	1
literature	1
too	1
indeed	1
zola	1
daudet	1
but	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
that	1
men	1
form	1
their	1
conceptions	1
from	1
fictitious	1
conventional	1
types	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
combinaisons	1
made	1
they	1
are	1
tired	1
of	1
the	1
fictitious	1
figures	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
invent	1
more	1
natural	1
true	1
figures	1
that	1
s	1
perfectly	1
true	1
said	1
vorknev	1
so	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
yes	1
yes	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
levin	1
thought	1
forgetting	1
himself	1
and	1
staring	1
persistently	1
at	1
her	1
lovely	1
mobile	1
face	1
which	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
was	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
completely	1
transformed	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
as	1
she	1
leaned	1
over	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
her	1
expression	1
her	1
face	1
so	1
handsome	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
in	1
its	1
repose	1
suddenly	1
wore	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
strange	1
curiosity	1
anger	1
and	1
pride	1
but	1
this	1
lasted	1
only	1
an	1
instant	1
she	1
dropped	1
her	1
eyelids	1
as	1
though	1
recollecting	1
something	1
oh	1
well	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
of	1
no	1
interest	1
to	1
anyone	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
english	1
girl	1
please	1
order	1
the	1
tea	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
english	1
the	1
girl	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
well	1
how	1
did	1
she	1
get	1
through	1
her	1
examination	1
asked	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
splendidly	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
gifted	1
child	1
and	1
a	1
sweet	1
character	1
it	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
your	1
loving	1
her	1
more	1
than	1

a	1
man	1

in	1

s	1
no	1
more	1
nor	1

my	1

and	1
her	1
with	1
another	1
i	1
was	1
just	1
telling	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1

vorkuev	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
energy	1
she	1
devotes	1
to	1
this	1
english	1
girl	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
russian	1
children	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
doing	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
useful	1
work	1
yes	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
i	1
couldn	1
t	1
do	1
it	1
count	1
alexey	1

me	1
very	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
uttered	1
the	1
words	1
count	1
alexey	1
kirillovitch	1
she	1
glanced	1
with	1
appealing	1
timidity	1
at	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
responded	1
with	1
a	1
respectful	1
and	1
reassuring	1
look	1
he	1
urged	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
school	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
i	1
visited	1
it	1
several	1
times	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
very	1
nice	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
drawn	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
you	1
speak	1
of	1
energy	1
energy	1
rests	1
upon	1
love	1
and	1
come	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
forcing	1
it	1
i	1
took	1
to	1
this	1
child	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
myself	1
say	1
why	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
levin	1
and	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
glance	1
all	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
only	1
she	1
was	1
addressing	1
her	1
words	1
valuing	1
his	1
good	1
opinion	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
sure	1
beforehand	1
that	1
they	1
understood	1
each	1
other	1
i	1
quite	1
understand	1
that	1
levin	1
answered	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
to	1
give	1
one	1
s	1
heart	1
to	1
a	1
school	1
or	1
such	1
institutions	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
why	1
philanthropic	1
institutions	1
always	1
give	1
such	1
poor	1
results	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
then	1
she	1
smiled	1
yes	1
yes	1
she	1
agreed	1
i	1
never	1

and	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
mournful	1
confiding	1
expression	1
ostensibly	1
addressing	1
her	1
brother	1
but	1
unmistakably	1
intending	1
her	1
words	1
only	1
for	1
levin	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
have	1
such	1
need	1
of	1
some	1
occupation	1
i	1
cannot	1
and	1
suddenly	1
frowning	1
levin	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
frowning	1
at	1
herself	1
for	1
talking	1
about	1
herself	1
she	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
i	1

about	1

she	1
said	1
to	1

that	1
you	1

citizen	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
defended	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
defended	1
me	1
oh	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
attacks	1
made	1
on	1
you	1
but	1
won	1
t	1
you	1

some	1
tea	1
she	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
book	1
bound	1
in	1
morocco	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
said	1
vorkuev	1
indicating	1
the	1
book	1
it	1
s	1
well	1
worth	1
taking	1
up	1
oh	1
no	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
so	1
sketchy	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
it	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
nodding	1
at	1
levin	1
you	1
shouldn	1
t	1
have	1
my	1
writing	1
is	1
something	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
those	1
little	1
baskets	1
and	1
carving	1
which	1
liza	1
mertsalova	1
used	1
to	1
sell	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
prisons	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
department	1
in	1
that	1
society	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
levin	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
miracles	1
of	1
patience	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
those	1
poor	1
wretches	1
and	1
levin	1
saw	1
a	1
new	1
trait	1
in	1
this	1
woman	1
who	1
attracted	1
him	1
so	1
extraordinarily	1
besides	1
wit	1
grace	1
and	1
beauty	1
she	1
had	1
truth	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
hide	1
from	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
sighed	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
suddenly	1
taking	1
a	1
hard	1
expression	1
looked	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
turned	1
to	1
stone	1
with	1
that	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
ever	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
was	1
new	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
that	1
expression	1
radiant	1
with	1
happiness	1
and	1
creating	1
happiness	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
painter	1
in	1
her	1
portrait	1
levin	1
looked	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
figure	1
as	1
taking	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
arm	1
she	1
walked	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
doors	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
a	1
tenderness	1
and	1
pity	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
wondered	1
himself	1
she	1
asked	1
levin	1
and	1
vorkuev	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
while	1
she	1
stayed	1
behind	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
about	1
her	1
divorce	1
about	1
vronsky	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
s	1
doing	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
about	1
me	1
wondered	1
levin	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
keenly	1
interested	1
by	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
that	1
he	1
scarcely	1
heard	1
what	1
vorkuev	1
was	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
qualities	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
for	1
children	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
had	1
written	1
at	1
tea	1
the	1
same	1
pleasant	1
sort	1
of	1
talk	1
full	1
of	1
interesting	1
matter	1
continued	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
when	1
a	1
subject	1
for	1
conversation	1
was	1
to	1
seek	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
was	1
felt	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
hardly	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
eagerly	1
held	1
back	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
saying	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
her	1
but	1
by	1
vorkuev	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
all	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
gained	1
peculiar	1
significance	1
from	1
her	1
appreciation	1
and	1
her	1
criticism	1
while	1
he	1
followed	1
this	1
interesting	1
conversation	1
levin	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
admiring	1
her	1
her	1
beauty	1
her	1
intelligence	1
her	1
culture	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
her	1
directness	1
and	1
genuine	1
depth	1
of	1
feeling	1
he	1
listened	1
and	1
talked	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
inner	1
life	1
trying	1
to	1
divine	1
her	1
feelings	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
judged	1
her	1
so	1
severely	1
hitherto	1
now	1
by	1
some	1
strange	1
chain	1
of	1
reasoning	1
he	1
was	1
justifying	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
also	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
afraid	1
that	1
vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
fully	1
understand	1
her	1
at	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
vorkuev	1
had	1
left	1
earlier	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
levin	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
regretfully	1
levin	1
too	1
rose	1
good	1
bye	1
she	1

his	1

she	1
dropped	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
half	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
tell	1
your	1
wife	1
that	1
i	1
love	1
her	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
cannot	1
pardon	1
me	1
my	1
position	1
then	1
my	1
wish	1
for	1
her	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
never	1
pardon	1
it	1
to	1
pardon	1
it	1
one	1
must	1
go	1
through	1
what	1

dreamily	1
an	1
extraordinary	1

of	1
everything	1
even	1
the	1

phrase	1
in	1
their	1

with	1

recalling	1
the	1

changes	1
in	1
her	1

more	1
and	1
more	1
into	1

reached	1
home	1
at	1
home	1

was	1
quite	1
well	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
sisters	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
been	1
gone	1
and	1
he	1
handed	1
him	1
two	1
letters	1
levin	1
read	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
that	1

from	1

him	1
for	1
her	1

being	1
still	1
unsettled	1
well	1
we	1
must	1

at	1

a	1
half	1
if	1

the	1

but	1
today	1
i	1

certainly	1
not	1

time	1
and	1
resolving	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
levin	1
rapidly	1
ran	1
through	1
mentally	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
all	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
conversations	1
conversations	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
conversations	1
were	1
upon	1
subjects	1
which	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
alone	1
at	1
home	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
taken	1
up	1
but	1
here	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
interesting	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
conversations	1
were	1
right	1
enough	1
only	1
in	1
two	1
places	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
quite	1
right	1
one	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
carp	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
quite	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
sympathy	1
he	1
was	1
feeling	1
for	1
anna	1
levin	1
found	1
his	1
wife	1
low	1
spirited	1
and	1
dull	1
the	1
dinner	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
sisters	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
then	1
they	1
had	1
waited	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
felt	1
dull	1
the	1
sisters	1
had	1
departed	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
alone	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
doing	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
which	1
shone	1
with	1
rather	1
a	1
suspicious	1
brightness	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
prevent	1
his	1
telling	1
her	1
everything	1
she	1
concealed	1
her	1
close	1
scrutiny	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
approving	1
smile	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
well	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
i	1
met	1
vronsky	1
i	1
felt	1
quite	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
natural	1
with	1
him	1
you	1
understand	1
i	1
shall	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
glad	1
that	1
this	1
awkwardness	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
remembering	1
that	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
immediately	1
gone	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
anna	1
he	1
blushed	1
we	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
peasants	1
drinking	1
i	1
don	1
t	1

which	1
drinks	1
most	1
the	1
peasantry	1
or	1
our	1
own	1
class	1
the	1
peasants	1
do	1
on	1
holidays	1
but	1
but	1
kitty	1
took	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
interest	1
in	1
discussing	1
the	1
drinking	1
habits	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
blushed	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
well	1
and	1
then	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
go	1
stiva	1
urged	1
me	1
awfully	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
levin	1
blushed	1
even	1
more	1
and	1
his	1
doubts	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
right	1
in	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
anna	1
were	1
settled	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
kitty	1
s	1
eyes	1
opened	1
in	1
a	1
curious	1
way	1
and	1
gleamed	1
at	1
anna	1
s	1
name	1
but	1
controlling	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
she	1
concealed	1
her	1
emotion	1
and	1
deceived	1
him	1
oh	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
i	1
m	1
sure	1

won	1
t	1

dolly	1
wished	1

levin	1
went	1
on	1
oh	1
no	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
a	1
constraint	1
that	1
boded	1
him	1
no	1
good	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
sweet	1
very	1
very	1
unhappy	1

woman	1
he	1
said	1
telling	1
her	1
about	1
anna	1
her	1
occupations	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
to	1

she	1
is	1
very	1
much	1

when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
whom	1

your	1
letter	1
from	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
and	1
believing	1
in	1
her	1
calm	1
tone	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
coat	1
coming	1
back	1
he	1
found	1
kitty	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
easy	1
chair	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
broke	1
into	1
sobs	1
what	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
asked	1
knowing	1
beforehand	1
what	1
you	1
re	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
hateful	1
woman	1
she	1
has	1
bewitched	1

must	1
go	1
away	1
i	1
shall	1
go	1

tomorrow	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
before	1
levin	1
could	1
soothe	1
his	1
wife	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
calming	1
her	1
only	1
by	1
confessing	1
that	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
pity	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
succumbed	1
to	1
anna	1
s	1
artful	1
influence	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
avoid	1
her	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
with	1
more	1
sincerity	1
confess	1
to	1
was	1
that	1
living	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
moscow	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
conversation	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
he	1
was	1
degenerating	1

talked	1
till	1
three	1
o	1

in	1
the	1
morning	1
only	1
at	1
three	1

reconciled	1
to	1

after	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1

guests	1

did	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
but	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
done	1
her	1
utmost	1
to	1
arouse	1
in	1
levin	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
as	1
of	1
late	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
doing	1
with	1
all	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
she	1
had	1
attained	1
her	1
aim	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
was	1
possible	1
in	1
one	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
married	1
and	1
conscientious	1
man	1
she	1
liked	1
him	1
indeed	1
extremely	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
striking	1
difference	1
from	1
the	1
masculine	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
between	1
vronsky	1
and	1
levin	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
she	1
saw	1
something	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
common	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
kitty	1
able	1
to	1
love	1
both	1
yet	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
ceased	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
one	1
thought	1
and	1
one	1
only	1
pursued	1
her	1
in	1
different	1
forms	1
and	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
off	1
if	1
i	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
effect	1
on	1
others	1
on	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
loves	1
his	1
home	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
cold	1
to	1
me	1
not	1
cold	1
exactly	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
but	1
something	1
new	1
is	1
drawing	1
us	1
apart	1
now	1
why	1
wasn	1
t	1
he	1
here	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
told	1
stiva	1
to	1

something	1

in	1
it	1
if	1
it	1

is	1
glad	1
of	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
showing	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
other	1
duties	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
submit	1
to	1
that	1
but	1
why	1
prove	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
his	1
freedom	1
but	1
i	1
need	1
no	1
proofs	1

all	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1

in	1
moscow	1

off	1

all	1
the	1

as	1

for	1

of	1

coming	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
she	1
heard	1
vronsky	1

abrupt	1
ring	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
dried	1
her	1
tears	1
not	1
only	1
dried	1
her	1
tears	1
but	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
lamp	1
and	1
opened	1
a	1
book	1
affecting	1
composure	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
displeased	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
home	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
displeased	1
only	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1

him	1
see	1
her	1
distress	1
and	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
self	1
pity	1
she	1
might	1
pity	1
herself	1
but	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
pity	1
her	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
strife	1
she	1
blamed	1
him	1
for	1
wanting	1
to	1
quarrel	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
put	1
herself	1
into	1
an	1
attitude	1
of	1
antagonism	1
well	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
dull	1
he	1
said	1
eagerly	1
and	1
good	1
humoredly	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
passion	1
it	1
is	1
gambling	1
no	1
i	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
dull	1
i	1
ve	1
learned	1
long	1
ago	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
dull	1
stiva	1

been	1
here	1
and	1
levin	1
yes	1
they	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
well	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
like	1
levin	1
he	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
very	1
much	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
long	1
been	1
gone	1
what	1
was	1
yashvin	1
doing	1
he	1
was	1
winning	1
seventeen	1
thousand	1
i	1
got	1
him	1
away	1
he	1
had	1
really	1
started	1
home	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
s	1
losing	1
then	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
stay	1
for	1
she	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
lifting	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
ungracious	1
you	1
told	1
stiva	1
you	1
were	1
staying	1
on	1
to	1
get	1
yashvin	1
away	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
left	1
him	1
there	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
cold	1
readiness	1
for	1
the	1
conflict	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
too	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
any	1
message	1
and	1
secondly	1
i	1
never	1
tell	1
lies	1
but	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
chief	1
point	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
stay	1
and	1
i	1
stayed	1
he	1
said	1
frowning	1
anna	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
why	1
will	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
silence	1
bending	1
over	1
towards	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
hand	1
hoping	1
she	1
would	1
lay	1
hers	1
in	1
it	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
this	1
appeal	1
for	1
tenderness	1
but	1
some	1
strange	1
force	1
of	1
evil	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
give	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
feelings	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
warfare	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
her	1
to	1
surrender	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
wanted	1
to	1
stay	1
and	1
you	1
stayed	1
you	1
do	1
everything	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
but	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
for	1
with	1
what	1
object	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
excited	1
does	1
anyone	1
contest	1
your	1
rights	1
but	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
and	1
you	1
re	1
welcome	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
his	1
hand	1
closed	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
obstinate	1
expression	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
obstinacy	1
she	1
said	1
watching	1
him	1
intently	1
and	1
suddenly	1
finding	1
the	1
right	1
word	1
for	1
that	1
expression	1
that	1
irritated	1
her	1
simply	1
obstinacy	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
whether	1
you	1
keep	1
the	1
upper	1
hand	1
of	1
me	1
while	1
for	1
me	1
again	1
she	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
she	1
almost	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
if	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
feel	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
now	1

inquired	1
trying	1
to	1
conceal	1
her	1
triumph	1
at	1
the	1
victory	1
which	1
had	1
anyway	1
been	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
supper	1
and	1
began	1
telling	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
races	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
tone	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
which	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
cold	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
forgive	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
victory	1
that	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
obstinacy	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
struggling	1
had	1
asserted	1
itself	1
again	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
colder	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
before	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
regretting	1
his	1
surrender	1

the	1
words	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
the	1

that	1
this	1
weapon	1

dangerous	1
one	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
used	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
beside	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
bound	1
them	1
together	1
there	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
between	1
them	1
some	1
evil	1
spirit	1
of	1
strife	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
exorcise	1
from	1
his	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
from	1

she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
bosom	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
he	1
hurriedly	1
jumped	1
up	1
hardly	1
awake	1
and	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
then	1
he	1
stopped	1
still	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
himself	1
from	1
her	1
eyes	1

thought	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
face	1
knew	1
her	1
expression	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
never	1
had	1
he	1
seen	1
it	1
like	1
this	1
how	1
hateful	1
and	1
horrible	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
himself	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
distress	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
her	1
yesterday	1
her	1
flushed	1
face	1
fringed	1
with	1
soft	1
curling	1
hair	1
under	1
her	1
night	1
cap	1
was	1
radiant	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
courage	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
so	1
little	1
that	1
was	1
complex	1
or	1
artificial	1
in	1
kitty	1
s	1
character	1
in	1
general	1
levin	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
what	1
was	1
revealed	1
now	1
when	1
suddenly	1
all	1
disguises	1
were	1
thrown	1
off	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
kernel	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
shone	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
simplicity	1
and	1
nakedness	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
she	1
the	1
very	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
in	1
her	1
was	1
more	1
manifest	1
than	1
ever	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
smiling	1
but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
her	1
brows	1
twitched	1
she	1
threw	1
up	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
going	1
quickly	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
clutched	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
pressed	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
breathing	1
her	1
hot	1
breath	1
upon	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
pain	1
and	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
complaining	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
suffering	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
from	1
habit	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tenderness	1
that	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
reproaching	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
sufferings	1
if	1
not	1
i	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
thought	1
unconsciously	1
seeking	1
someone	1
responsible	1
for	1
this	1
suffering	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
punish	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
responsible	1
she	1
was	1
suffering	1
complaining	1
and	1
triumphing	1
in	1
her	1
sufferings	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
loving	1
them	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
something	1
sublime	1
was	1
being	1
accomplished	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
it	1
was	1
beyond	1
his	1
understanding	1

up	1

at	1

as	1
a	1

was	1
not	1

he	1
ran	1
again	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

not	1
on	1

seemed	1
to	1
him	1

on	1
wings	1
two	1

were	1
carefully	1
moving	1
something	1

said	1

frowning	1
and	1
waving	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
when	1
suddenly	1
a	1
plaintive	1
moan	1
sounded	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom	1
smothered	1
instantly	1
he	1
stood	1
still	1

for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1

could	1
not	1

repeated	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
came	1
suddenly	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
he	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
repeated	1
these	1
words	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
only	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
doubts	1
even	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
believing	1
with	1
his	1
reason	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
in	1

turning	1

all	1
of	1
that	1

out	1
of	1

turn	1
if	1

and	1
his	1
intellect	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1

he	1
started	1
off	1
on	1
foot	1
without	1

for	1
the	1

told	1

her	1
little	1
fair	1
face	1

wore	1

peculiarly	1
serious	1

ran	1
along	1

for	1
two	1

him	1

immediately	1
on	1

the	1

realized	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
or	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
know	1
his	1

that	1

that	1
the	1

that	1

should	1

for	1
another	1

back	1
the	1

either	1
by	1

the	1

by	1

the	1

sealed	1
up	1
a	1
packet	1
of	1
powders	1
for	1
a	1
coachman	1
who	1
stood	1
waiting	1
and	1
refused	1
him	1

with	1
the	1

callousness	1
with	1
which	1
the	1

the	1

explaining	1
what	1
the	1
opium	1
was	1
needed	1
for	1

to	1
persuade	1
him	1
the	1
assistant	1
inquired	1
in	1

whether	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
it	1
and	1
receiving	1
an	1
affirmative	1
reply	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
partition	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
bottle	1
and	1
a	1
funnel	1
deliberately	1
poured	1
the	1
opium	1
from	1
a	1
bigger	1
bottle	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
one	1
stuck	1
on	1
a	1

up	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
request	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
wrap	1
it	1
up	1
too	1
this	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
levin	1
could	1
stand	1

took	1
the	1
bottle	1
firmly	1
out	1
of	1
his	1

ran	1
to	1
the	1

not	1
even	1
now	1
getting	1
up	1

the	1

busy	1
now	1
in	1
putting	1
down	1

took	1
out	1
a	1
ten	1

careful	1
to	1
speak	1
slowly	1
though	1
losing	1
no	1
time	1
over	1
the	1
business	1
he	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
note	1
and	1
explained	1
that	1

what	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
important	1
personage	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1

now	1
this	1
pyotr	1

who	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
consequence	1
in	1
his	1

before	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
therefore	1
wake	1
him	1
at	1
once	1

agreed	1
and	1
went	1
upstairs	1

levin	1
into	1
the	1

room	1

could	1
hear	1
through	1

coughing	1
moving	1
about	1

saying	1
something	1
three	1

at	1

some	1

said	1
levin	1
jumping	1
up	1
so	1
you	1
ll	1
be	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
on	1
your	1
honor	1
when	1
levin	1
got	1
home	1
he	1
drove	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
door	1
together	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
shaking	1
seeing	1
levin	1
she	1
embraced	1
him	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
well	1
my	1
dear	1
lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
she	1
queried	1
clasping	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
midwife	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
and	1
anxious	1
face	1
she	1
s	1
going	1
on	1
well	1
she	1
said	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
easier	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
waked	1
up	1
and	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
levin	1
had	1
prepared	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
bear	1
resolutely	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
without	1
considering	1
or	1
anticipating	1
anything	1
to	1
avoid	1
upsetting	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
and	1
keep	1
up	1
her	1
courage	1
without	1
allowing	1
himself	1
even	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
of	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
end	1
judging	1
from	1
his	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
duration	1
of	1
these	1
ordeals	1
levin	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
braced	1
himself	1
to	1
bear	1
up	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
tight	1
rein	1
on	1
his	1
feelings	1
for	1
five	1
hours	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
this	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
sufferings	1
again	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
repeating	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
succor	1
us	1
he	1
sighed	1
and	1
flung	1
his	1
head	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
afraid	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
or	1
run	1
away	1
such	1
agony	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
hour	1
had	1
passed	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
hour	1
there	1
passed	1
another	1
hour	1
two	1
hours	1
three	1
the	1
full	1
five	1
hours	1
he	1
had	1
fixed	1
as	1
the	1
furthest	1
limit	1
of	1
his	1
sufferings	1
and	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
still	1
unchanged	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
bearing	1
it	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
bear	1
it	1
every	1
instant	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
utmost	1
limits	1
of	1
his	1
endurance	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
would	1
break	1
with	1
sympathy	1
and	1
pain	1
but	1
still	1
the	1
minutes	1
passed	1
by	1
and	1
the	1
hours	1
and	1
still	1
hours	1
more	1
and	1
his	1
misery	1
and	1
horror	1
grew	1
and	1
were	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
intense	1
all	1
the	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
without	1
which	1
one	1
can	1
form	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
anything	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
exist	1
for	1
levin	1
he	1
lost	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
time	1
minutes	1
those	1
minutes	1
when	1
she	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
her	1
moist	1
hand	1
that	1
would	1
squeeze	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
violence	1
and	1
then	1
push	1
it	1
away	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
hours	1
and	1
hours	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
minutes	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
when	1
lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
light	1
a	1
candle	1
behind	1
a	1
screen	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
surprised	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
knew	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
anything	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
swollen	1
face	1
sometimes	1
bewildered	1
and	1
in	1
agony	1
sometimes	1
smiling	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
reassure	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
too	1
flushed	1
and	1
overwrought	1
with	1
her	1
gray	1
curls	1
in	1
disorder	1
forcing	1
herself	1
to	1
gulp	1
down	1
her	1
tears	1
biting	1
her	1
lips	1
he	1
saw	1
dolly	1
too	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
smoking	1
fat	1
cigarettes	1
and	1
lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
resolute	1
reassuring	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
a	1
frowning	1
face	1
but	1
why	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1

was	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
where	1
a	1
table	1
set	1
for	1
dinner	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
then	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
but	1
dolly	1
was	1
then	1
levin	1
remembered	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
somewhere	1
once	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
move	1
a	1
table	1
and	1
sofa	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
eagerly	1
thinking	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
her	1

and	1
only	1
later	1
on	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
bed	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
getting	1
ready	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
study	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
doctor	1
something	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
answered	1
and	1
then	1
had	1
said	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
irregularities	1
in	1
the	1
municipal	1
council	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
to	1
move	1
the	1
holy	1
picture	1
in	1
its	1
silver	1
and	1
gold	1
setting	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
old	1
waiting	1
maid	1
he	1
had	1
clambered	1
on	1
a	1
shelf	1
to	1
reach	1
it	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
little	1
lamp	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
reassure	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
he	1
carried	1
the	1
holy	1
picture	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
at	1
kitty	1
s	1
head	1
carefully	1
tucking	1
it	1
in	1
behind	1
the	1
pillow	1
but	1
where	1
when	1
and	1
why	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
happened	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
looking	1
compassionately	1
at	1
him	1
begged	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
worry	1
himself	1
and	1
dolly	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
something	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
doctor	1
looked	1
seriously	1
and	1
with	1
commiseration	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
something	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
felt	1
was	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
was	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
nearly	1
a	1
year	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
hotel	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
town	1
at	1
the	1
deathbed	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
nikolay	1
but	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
grief	1
this	1
was	1
joy	1
yet	1
that	1
grief	1
and	1
this	1
joy	1
were	1
alike	1
outside	1
all	1
the	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
they	1
were	1
loop	1
holes	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
ordinary	1
life	1
through	1
which	1
there	1
came	1
glimpses	1
of	1
something	1
sublime	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
this	1
sublime	1
something	1
the	1
soul	1
was	1
exalted	1
to	1
inconceivable	1
heights	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
before	1
had	1
no	1
conception	1
while	1
reason	1
lagged	1
behind	1
unable	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
it	1
lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
succor	1
us	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself	1
incessantly	1
feeling	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
complete	1
alienation	1
from	1
religion	1
that	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
god	1
just	1
as	1
trustfully	1
and	1
simply	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
childhood	1
and	1
first	1
youth	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
distinct	1
spiritual	1
conditions	1
one	1
was	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
who	1
kept	1
smoking	1
one	1
fat	1
cigarette	1
after	1
another	1
and	1
extinguishing	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
full	1
ashtray	1
with	1
dolly	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
talk	1
about	1
dinner	1
about	1
politics	1
about	1
marya	1
petrovna	1
s	1
illness	1
and	1
where	1
levin	1
suddenly	1
forgot	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
and	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
waked	1
up	1
from	1
sleep	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
at	1
her	1
pillow	1
where	1
his	1
heart	1
seemed	1
breaking	1
and	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
break	1
from	1
sympathetic	1
suffering	1
and	1
he	1
prayed	1
to	1
god	1
without	1
ceasing	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
back	1
from	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
oblivion	1
by	1
a	1
scream	1
reaching	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
strange	1
terror	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
shriek	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
ran	1
to	1
justify	1
himself	1
remembered	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
defend	1
her	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
saw	1
again	1
that	1
help	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
terror	1
and	1
prayed	1
lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
help	1
us	1
and	1
as	1
time	1
went	1
on	1
both	1
these	1
conditions	1
became	1
more	1
intense	1
the	1
calmer	1
he	1
became	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
completely	1
forgetting	1
her	1
the	1
more	1
agonizing	1
became	1
both	1
her	1
sufferings	1
and	1
his	1
feeling	1
of	1
helplessness	1
before	1
them	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
but	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
sometimes	1
when	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
called	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
blamed	1
her	1
but	1
seeing	1
her	1
patient	1
smiling	1
face	1
and	1
hearing	1
the	1
words	1
i	1
am	1
worrying	1
you	1
he	1
threw	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
god	1
but	1
thinking	1
of	1
god	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
beseeching	1
god	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1

out	1
dolly	1

just	1
been	1
in	1
the	1

and	1
had	1
suggested	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
lie	1
down	1
levin	1
sat	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
stories	1
of	1
a	1
quack	1
mesmerizer	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
his	1
cigarette	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
repose	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
sunk	1
into	1
oblivion	1
he	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
now	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
chat	1
and	1
understood	1
it	1
suddenly	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
unearthly	1
shriek	1
the	1
shriek	1
was	1
so	1
awful	1
that	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
jump	1
up	1
but	1
holding	1
his	1
breath	1
gazed	1
in	1
terrified	1
inquiry	1
at	1
the	1
doctor	1
the	1
doctor	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
listened	1
and	1
smiled	1
approvingly	1
everything	1
was	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
strike	1
levin	1
as	1
strange	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
still	1
sat	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
whose	1
scream	1
was	1
this	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
ran	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
edged	1
round	1
lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
position	1
at	1
kitty	1
s	1
pillow	1
the	1
scream	1
had	1
subsided	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
change	1
now	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
comprehend	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
or	1
comprehend	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
s	1
face	1
was	1
stern	1
and	1
pale	1
and	1
still	1
as	1
resolute	1
though	1
her	1
jaws	1
were	1
twitching	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
intently	1
on	1
kitty	1
kitty	1
s	1
swollen	1
and	1
agonized	1
face	1
a	1
tress	1
of	1
hair	1
clinging	1
to	1
her	1
moist	1
brow	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
sought	1
his	1
eyes	1
her	1
lifted	1
hands	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
hands	1
clutching	1
his	1
chill	1
hands	1
in	1
her	1
moist	1
ones	1

lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
she	1
spoke	1
quickly	1
very	1
quickly	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
smile	1
but	1
suddenly	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
drawn	1
she	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
oh	1
this	1
is	1
awful	1
i	1
m	1
dying	1
i	1
m	1

away	1
she	1
shrieked	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
unearthly	1
scream	1
levin	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
it	1

nothing	1

called	1
after	1
him	1
but	1
they	1
might	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
liked	1
he	1
knew	1
now	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
his	1
head	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
door	1
post	1
and	1
heard	1
shrieks	1
howls	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
before	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
kitty	1
was	1
uttering	1
these	1
shrieks	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
ceased	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
by	1
now	1
he	1
loathed	1
this	1
child	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
for	1
her	1
life	1
now	1
all	1
he	1
longed	1
for	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
awful	1
anguish	1
doctor	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
by	1
god	1
he	1
said	1
snatching	1
at	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
hand	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
end	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
grave	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
that	1
levin	1
took	1
the	1
end	1
as	1
meaning	1
her	1
death	1
beside	1
himself	1
he	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
frowning	1
and	1
stern	1
kitty	1
s	1
face	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
was	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
fearful	1
in	1
its	1
strained	1
distortion	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sounds	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
it	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
wooden	1
framework	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
bursting	1
the	1
awful	1
scream	1
never	1
paused	1
it	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
awful	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
utmost	1
limit	1
of	1
terror	1
suddenly	1
it	1
ceased	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
his	1
ears	1
but	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
scream	1
had	1
ceased	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
subdued	1
stir	1
and	1
bustle	1
and	1
hurried	1
breathing	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
gasping	1
alive	1
tender	1
and	1
blissful	1
uttered	1
softly	1
it	1
s	1
over	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
hanging	1
exhausted	1
on	1
the	1
quilt	1
looking	1
extraordinarily	1
lovely	1
and	1
serene	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
smile	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
suddenly	1
from	1
the	1
mysterious	1
and	1
awful	1
far	1
away	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
twenty	1
two	1
hours	1
levin	1
felt	1
himself	1
all	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
borne	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
every	1
day	1
world	1
glorified	1
though	1
now	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
radiance	1
of	1
happiness	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
it	1
the	1
strained	1
chords	1
snapped	1
sobs	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
foreseen	1
rose	1
up	1
with	1
such	1
violence	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
shook	1
that	1
for	1
long	1
they	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
speaking	1
falling	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
the	1
bed	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
hand	1
before	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
weak	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
fingers	1
responded	1
to	1
his	1
kiss	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
in	1
the	1
deft	1
hands	1
of	1
lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
like	1
a	1
flickering	1
light	1
in	1
a	1
lamp	1
lay	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
creature	1
which	1
had	1
never	1
existed	1
before	1
and	1
which	1
would	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
right	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
importance	1
to	1
itself	1
live	1
and	1
create	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
image	1
alive	1
alive	1
and	1
a	1
boy	1
too	1
set	1
your	1
mind	1
at	1
rest	1
levin	1
heard	1
lizaveta	1
petrovna	1
saying	1
as	1
she	1
slapped	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
back	1
with	1
a	1
shaking	1
hand	1
mamma	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
said	1
kitty	1
s	1
voice	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
sobs	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
answers	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
silence	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
unmistakable	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
mother	1
s	1
question	1
a	1
voice	1
quite	1
unlike	1
the	1
subdued	1
voices	1
speaking	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
bold	1
clamorous	1
self	1
assertive	1
squall	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
human	1
being	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
incomprehensibly	1
appeared	1
if	1
levin	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
before	1
that	1
kitty	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
died	1
with	1
her	1
and	1

in	1

towards	1
the	1

called	1
for	1
such	1
immense	1
energy	1

such	1

that	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1

not	1

it	1

at	1

that	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
to	1

in	1

besides	1
this	1
business	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
promised	1
his	1

to	1
obtain	1
from	1
karenin	1
a	1
definite	1
answer	1
on	1
the	1

and	1
begging	1
fifty	1

from	1
dolly	1

set	1
off	1
for	1
petersburg	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
sat	1
in	1
karenin	1
s	1
study	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
report	1
on	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
unsatisfactory	1
position	1
of	1
russian	1
finance	1
and	1
only	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
finish	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
his	1
own	1
business	1
or	1
about	1
anna	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
very	1
true	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
pince	1
nez	1
without	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
now	1
and	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
former	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
that	1
s	1
very	1
true	1
in	1
particular	1
cases	1
but	1
still	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
our	1
day	1
is	1
freedom	1
yes	1
but	1
i	1
lay	1
down	1
another	1
principle	1
embracing	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
freedom	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
with	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
embracing	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
pince	1
nez	1
again	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
passage	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
statement	1
was	1
made	1
and	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
beautifully	1
written	1
wide	1
margined	1
manuscript	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
read	1
aloud	1
over	1
again	1
the	1
conclusive	1
passage	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
advocate	1
protection	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
private	1
interests	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
weal	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
lower	1
and	1
upper	1
classes	1
equally	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
over	1
his	1
pince	1
nez	1
at	1
oblonsky	1
but	1
they	1
cannot	1
grasp	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
taken	1
up	1
now	1
with	1
personal	1
interests	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
phrases	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
karenin	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
and	1
thinking	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
accept	1
his	1
report	1
and	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
everything	1
wrong	1
in	1
russia	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
coming	1
near	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
so	1
now	1
he	1
eagerly	1
abandoned	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
free	1
trade	1
and	1
fully	1
agreed	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
paused	1
thoughtfully	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
his	1
manuscript	1
oh	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
some	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
pomorsky	1
to	1
drop	1
him	1
a	1
hint	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
that	1
new	1
appointment	1
of	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
of	1
the	1
amalgamated	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
southern	1
railways	1
and	1
banking	1
companies	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
familiar	1
by	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
he	1
coveted	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
rapidly	1
without	1
mistake	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
questioned	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
committee	1
and	1
pondered	1
he	1
was	1
considering	1
whether	1
the	1
new	1
committee	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
acting	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
advocating	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
committee	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
complex	1
nature	1
and	1
his	1
views	1
were	1
of	1
very	1
wide	1
application	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
decide	1
this	1
straight	1
off	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
pince	1
nez	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
can	1
mention	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
reason	1
precisely	1
for	1
wishing	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
appointment	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
salary	1
rising	1
to	1
nine	1
thousand	1
and	1
my	1
means	1
nine	1
thousand	1
repeated	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
he	1
frowned	1
the	1
high	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
salary	1
made	1
him	1
reflect	1
that	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
proposed	1
position	1
ran	1
counter	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
tendency	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
projects	1
of	1
reform	1
which	1
always	1
leaned	1
towards	1
economy	1
i	1
consider	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
embodied	1
my	1
views	1
in	1
a	1
note	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
in	1
our	1
day	1
these	1
immense	1
salaries	1
are	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
unsound	1
economic	1
assiette	1
of	1
our	1
finances	1
but	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
suppose	1
a	1
bank	1
director	1
gets	1
ten	1
thousand	1
well	1
he	1
s	1
worth	1
it	1
or	1
an	1
engineer	1
gets	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
growing	1
thing	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
assume	1
that	1
a	1
salary	1
is	1
the	1
price	1
paid	1
for	1
a	1
commodity	1
and	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
conform	1
with	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
supply	1
and	1
demand	1
if	1
the	1
salary	1
is	1
fixed	1
without	1
any	1
regard	1
for	1
that	1
law	1
as	1
for	1
instance	1
when	1
i	1
see	1
two	1
engineers	1
leaving	1
college	1
together	1
both	1
equally	1
well	1
trained	1
and	1
efficient	1
and	1
one	1
getting	1
forty	1
thousand	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
satisfied	1
with	1
two	1
or	1
when	1
i	1
see	1
lawyers	1
and	1
hussars	1
having	1
no	1
special	1
qualifications	1
appointed	1
directors	1
of	1
banking	1
companies	1
with	1
immense	1
salaries	1
i	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
salary	1
is	1
not	1
fixed	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
supply	1
and	1
demand	1
but	1
simply	1
through	1
personal	1
interest	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
an	1
abuse	1
of	1
great	1
gravity	1
in	1
itself	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
reacts	1
injuriously	1
on	1
the	1
government	1
service	1
i	1
consider	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
interrupt	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
yes	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
agree	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
new	1
institution	1
of	1
undoubted	1
utility	1
that	1
s	1
being	1
started	1
after	1
all	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
growing	1
thing	1
what	1
they	1
lay	1
particular	1
stress	1
on	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
honestly	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
with	1
emphasis	1
but	1
the	1
moscow	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
honest	1
was	1
lost	1
on	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
honesty	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
negative	1
qualification	1
he	1
said	1
well	1
you	1
ll	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
service	1
anyway	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
by	1
putting	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
pomorsky	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
conversation	1
but	1
i	1
fancy	1
it	1
s	1
more	1
in	1
volgarinov	1

hands	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
volgarinov	1
has	1
fully	1
assented	1
as	1
far	1
as	1

concerned	1

arkadyevitch	1
turning	1
red	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
reddened	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
that	1
name	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
that	1
morning	1
at	1
the	1
jew	1
volgarinov	1
s	1
and	1
the	1
visit	1
had	1
left	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
recollection	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
believed	1
most	1
positively	1
that	1
the	1
committee	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
an	1
appointment	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
genuine	1
and	1
honest	1
public	1
body	1
but	1
that	1
morning	1
when	1
volgarinov	1
had	1
intentionally	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
kept	1
him	1
two	1
hours	1
waiting	1
with	1
other	1
petitioners	1
in	1
his	1
waiting	1
room	1
he	1
had	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
uneasy	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
uncomfortable	1
that	1
he	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
rurik	1
prince	1
oblonsky	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
for	1
two	1
hours	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
jew	1
or	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
following	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
his	1
ancestors	1
in	1
serving	1
the	1
government	1
but	1
was	1
turning	1
off	1
into	1
a	1
new	1
career	1
anyway	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
uncomfortable	1
during	1
those	1
two	1
hours	1
in	1
volgarinov	1
s	1
waiting	1
room	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
stepping	1
jauntily	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
pulling	1
his	1
whiskers	1
entering	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
petitioners	1
and	1
inventing	1
an	1
epigram	1
on	1
his	1
position	1
assiduously	1
concealed	1
from	1
others	1
and	1
even	1
from	1
himself	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
was	1
experiencing	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
angry	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
why	1
whether	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
his	1
epigram	1
just	1
right	1
or	1
from	1
some	1
other	1
reason	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
volgarinov	1
had	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
exaggerated	1
politeness	1
and	1
unmistakable	1
triumph	1
at	1
his	1
humiliation	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
but	1
refused	1
the	1
favor	1
asked	1
of	1
him	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
forget	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
recollection	1

pausing	1
for	1
a	1
brief	1

shaking	1
off	1

uttered	1

of	1
alexey	1

completely	1

it	1

dead	1

exactly	1
that	1

was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1

afraid	1
of	1
wrecking	1
his	1
negotiation	1
by	1
this	1
he	1
changed	1
the	1
words	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
statesman	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
sound	1
à	1
propos	1

simply	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
christian	1
you	1
must	1
have	1

on	1
her	1
he	1

that	1
is	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
precisely	1
karenin	1

softly	1
yes	1

if	1
you	1

i	1

i	1
have	1
been	1
spending	1
all	1
the	1

with	1
her	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
her	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
awful	1
simply	1
awful	1
i	1
had	1
imagined	1
answered	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
in	1
a	1
higher	1
almost	1
shrill	1
voice	1
that	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
had	1
everything	1
she	1
had	1
desired	1
for	1
herself	1
oh	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
for	1
heaven	1
s	1

don	1

let	1
us	1
indulge	1
in	1
recriminations	1
what	1
is	1
past	1
is	1
past	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
wants	1
and	1
is	1
waiting	1
for	1
divorce	1
but	1
i	1
believe	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
refuses	1
a	1
divorce	1
if	1
i	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
condition	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
my	1
son	1
i	1
replied	1
in	1
that	1
sense	1
and	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
ended	1
i	1
consider	1
it	1
at	1
an	1
end	1

his	1

the	1

is	1
not	1
ended	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
recapitulate	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
this	1
when	1
you	1
parted	1
you	1
were	1
as	1
magnanimous	1
as	1
could	1
possibly	1
be	1
you	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
everything	1

that	1
no	1

did	1
not	1

she	1
gave	1
up	1
everything	1
but	1
experience	1

have	1
shown	1
that	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
unbearable	1
impossible	1
the	1

of	1

me	1
to	1
disbelieve	1
that	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
replied	1
gently	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
intolerable	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
of	1
no	1

to	1
anyone	1

has	1
deserved	1

arkadyevitch	1
touching	1
his	1
hand	1
again	1
as	1
though	1
feeling	1
sure	1
this	1
physical	1
contact	1
would	1
soften	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
all	1
i	1
say	1
is	1
this	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
intolerable	1
and	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
alleviated	1
by	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
lose	1
nothing	1
by	1
it	1
i	1
will	1
arrange	1

for	1
you	1

that	1
you	1

it	1
you	1
did	1
promise	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
promise	1
was	1
given	1
before	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
had	1
settled	1
the	1
matter	1
besides	1
i	1
had	1
hoped	1
that	1

arkadyevna	1
had	1
enough	1
generosity	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
articulated	1
with	1
difficulty	1
his	1
lips	1
twitching	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
white	1
she	1
leaves	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
your	1
generosity	1
she	1
begs	1
she	1
implores	1
one	1
thing	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
extricate	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
impossible	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
is	1
placed	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
her	1
son	1
now	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
put	1
yourself	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
divorce	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
promised	1
it	1
once	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
reconciled	1
herself	1
to	1
her	1
position	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
but	1
you	1
promised	1
it	1
and	1
she	1
wrote	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
moscow	1
and	1
here	1
she	1
s	1
been	1
for	1
six	1
months	1
in	1
moscow	1
where	1
every	1
chance	1
meeting	1
cuts	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
every	1
day	1
expecting	1
an	1
answer	1
why	1
it	1
s	1
like	1
keeping	1
a	1
condemned	1
criminal	1
for	1
six	1
months	1
with	1
the	1
rope	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
promising	1
him	1
perhaps	1
death	1
perhaps	1
mercy	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
i	1
will	1

about	1
that	1
alexey	1

interrupted	1
with	1
disgust	1
but	1
perhaps	1
i	1
promised	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
promise	1
so	1
you	1
go	1
back	1
from	1
your	1
promise	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
refused	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
that	1

shrilly	1
getting	1
suddenly	1
onto	1
his	1
feet	1
his	1

and	1
his	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
but	1
like	1
a	1
messenger	1
i	1
have	1
simply	1
performed	1
the	1
commission	1
given	1
me	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
hand	1
pondered	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
must	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
seek	1
for	1
guidance	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
i	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
final	1
answer	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
considering	1
a	1
moment	1
chapter	1
19	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
when	1
korney	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
announce	1
sergey	1
alexyevitch	1
who	1
s	1
sergey	1
alexyevitch	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
he	1
remembered	1
immediately	1
ah	1
seryozha	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
sergey	1
alexyevitch	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
director	1
of	1
a	1
department	1
anna	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
too	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
timid	1
piteous	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
anna	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
parting	1
anyway	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
him	1
find	1
out	1
exactly	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
who	1
is	1
looking	1
after	1
him	1
and	1
stiva	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
meant	1
by	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
arrange	1
the	1
divorce	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
have	1
her	1
son	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
dream	1
of	1
that	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
nephew	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
reminded	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
boy	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
he	1
begged	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
about	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
ill	1
after	1
that	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
foreseen	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
indeed	1
we	1
feared	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
but	1
with	1
rational	1
treatment	1
and	1
sea	1
bathing	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
he	1
regained	1
his	1
strength	1
and	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
advice	1
i	1
have	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
to	1
school	1
and	1
certainly	1
the	1
companionship	1
of	1
school	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
perfectly	1
well	1
and	1
making	1
good	1
progress	1
what	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
he	1
s	1
grown	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
seryozha	1
now	1
but	1
quite	1
full	1
fledged	1
sergey	1
alexyevitch	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
handsome	1
broad	1
shouldered	1
lad	1
in	1
blue	1
coat	1
and	1
long	1
trousers	1
who	1
walked	1
in	1
alertly	1
and	1
confidently	1
the	1
boy	1
looked	1
healthy	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
his	1
uncle	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
stranger	1
but	1
recognizing	1
him	1
he	1
blushed	1
and	1
turned	1
hurriedly	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
offended	1
and	1
irritated	1
at	1
something	1
the	1
boy	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
the	1
marks	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
in	1
school	1
well	1
that	1
s	1
very	1
fair	1
said	1
his	1
father	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
he	1
s	1
thinner	1
and	1
taller	1
and	1
has	1
grown	1
out	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
child	1
into	1
a	1
boy	1
i	1
like	1
that	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
me	1
the	1
boy	1
looked	1
back	1
quickly	1
at	1
his	1
uncle	1
yes	1
mon	1
oncle	1
he	1
answered	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
looked	1
downcast	1
his	1
uncle	1
called	1
him	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
well	1
and	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
getting	1
on	1
he	1
said	1
wanting	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
boy	1
blushing	1
and	1
making	1
no	1
answer	1
cautiously	1
drew	1
his	1
hand	1
away	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
let	1
go	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
glanced	1
doubtfully	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
set	1
free	1
he	1
darted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
seryozha	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
mother	1
since	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
school	1
and	1
made	1
friends	1
among	1
his	1
schoolfellows	1
the	1
dreams	1
and	1
memories	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
ill	1
after	1
seeing	1
her	1
did	1
not	1
occupy	1
his	1
thoughts	1
now	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
studiously	1
drove	1
them	1
away	1
regarding	1
them	1
as	1
shameful	1
and	1
girlish	1
below	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
and	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
were	1
separated	1
by	1
some	1
quarrel	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
idea	1
he	1
disliked	1
seeing	1
his	1
uncle	1
so	1
like	1
his	1
mother	1
for	1
it	1
called	1
up	1
those	1
memories	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed	1
he	1
disliked	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
as	1
from	1
some	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
caught	1
as	1
he	1
waited	1
at	1
the	1
study	1
door	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
from	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
uncle	1
he	1
guessed	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
talking	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
to	1
avoid	1
condemning	1
the	1
father	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
lived	1
and	1
on	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
dependent	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
avoid	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
sentimentality	1
which	1
he	1
considered	1
so	1
degrading	1
seryozha	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
uncle	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
disturb	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
recalled	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
when	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
going	1
out	1
after	1
him	1
saw	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
calling	1
to	1
him	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
spent	1
his	1
playtime	1
at	1
school	1
seryozha	1
talked	1
more	1
freely	1
to	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
presence	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
railway	1
now	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
uncle	1
s	1
question	1
it	1
s	1
like	1
this	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
two	1
sit	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
they	1
re	1
the	1
passengers	1
and	1
one	1
stands	1
up	1
straight	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
and	1
all	1
are	1
harnessed	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
their	1
arms	1
or	1
by	1
their	1
belts	1
and	1
they	1
run	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
the	1
doors	1
are	1
left	1
open	1
beforehand	1
well	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
pretty	1
hard	1
work	1
being	1
the	1
conductor	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
stands	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
inquired	1
smiling	1
yes	1
you	1
want	1
pluck	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
cleverness	1
too	1
especially	1
when	1
they	1
stop	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
or	1
someone	1
falls	1
down	1
yes	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
serious	1
matter	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
watching	1
with	1
mournful	1
interest	1
the	1
eager	1
eyes	1
like	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
not	1
childish	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
fully	1
innocent	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
anna	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
himself	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
your	1
mother	1
he	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
no	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
seryozha	1
said	1
quickly	1
he	1
blushed	1
crimson	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
clouded	1
over	1
and	1
his	1
uncle	1
could	1
get	1
nothing	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
his	1
tutor	1
found	1
his	1
pupil	1
on	1
the	1
staircase	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
ill	1
tempered	1
or	1
crying	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
i	1
expect	1
you	1
hurt	1
yourself	1
when	1
you	1
fell	1
down	1
said	1
the	1
tutor	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dangerous	1
game	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1

in	1

besides	1
business	1
his	1

and	1
his	1
coveted	1
appointment	1
he	1
wanted	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
to	1
freshen	1
himself	1
up	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
the	1
mustiness	1
of	1
moscow	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
its	1
cafés	1
chantants	1
and	1
its	1
omnibuses	1
moscow	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
stagnant	1
bog	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
always	1
felt	1
it	1
after	1
living	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
moscow	1
especially	1
in	1
close	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
depression	1
of	1
spirits	1
after	1
being	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
moscow	1
without	1
a	1
change	1
he	1
reached	1
a	1
point	1
when	1
he	1
positively	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
worrying	1
himself	1
over	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
ill	1
humor	1
and	1
reproaches	1
over	1
his	1
children	1
s	1
health	1
and	1
education	1
and	1
the	1
petty	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
official	1
work	1
even	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
debt	1
worried	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
in	1
petersburg	1
in	1
the	1
circle	1
there	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
moved	1
where	1
people	1
lived	1
really	1
lived	1
instead	1
of	1
vegetating	1
as	1
in	1
moscow	1
and	1
all	1
such	1
ideas	1
vanished	1
and	1
melted	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
like	1
wax	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
his	1
wife	1
only	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
prince	1
tchetchensky	1
prince	1
tchetchensky	1
had	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
family	1
grown	1
up	1
pages	1
in	1
the	1
corps	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
another	1
illegitimate	1
family	1
of	1
children	1
also	1
though	1
the	1
first	1
family	1
was	1
very	1
nice	1
too	1
prince	1
tchetchensky	1
felt	1
happier	1
in	1
his	1
second	1
family	1
and	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
eldest	1
son	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
second	1
family	1
and	1
told	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
good	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
enlarging	1
his	1
ideas	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
that	1
in	1
moscow	1
his	1
children	1
in	1
petersburg	1
children	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
their	1
parents	1
from	1
enjoying	1
life	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
schools	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
idea	1
that	1
prevailed	1
in	1
moscow	1
in	1
lvov	1
s	1
household	1
for	1
instance	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
luxuries	1
of	1
life	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
while	1
the	1
parents	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
work	1
and	1
anxiety	1
here	1
people	1
understood	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
in	1
duty	1
bound	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
himself	1
as	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
culture	1
should	1
live	1
his	1
official	1
duties	1
official	1
work	1
here	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
stiff	1
hopeless	1
drudgery	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
moscow	1
here	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
interest	1
in	1
official	1
life	1
a	1
chance	1
meeting	1
a	1
service	1
rendered	1
a	1
happy	1
phrase	1
a	1
knack	1
of	1
facetious	1
mimicry	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
career	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
in	1
a	1
trice	1
so	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
bryantsev	1
whom	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
met	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
functionaries	1
in	1
government	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
interest	1
in	1
official	1
work	1
like	1
that	1
the	1
petersburg	1
attitude	1
on	1
pecuniary	1
matters	1
had	1
an	1
especially	1
soothing	1
effect	1
on	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
bartnyansky	1
who	1
must	1
spend	1
at	1
least	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
style	1
he	1
lived	1
in	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
interesting	1
comment	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
before	1
dinner	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
bartnyansky	1
you	1
re	1

with	1
mordvinsky	1
you	1
might	1
do	1

word	1
to	1

for	1
me	1
there	1
s	1
an	1
appointment	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
get	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
agency	1
oh	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1
remember	1
all	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
what	1
possesses	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
railways	1
and	1
jews	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
low	1
business	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
to	1
bartnyansky	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
growing	1
thing	1
bartnyansky	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
understood	1
that	1
i	1
want	1
the	1
money	1
i	1
ve	1
nothing	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
you	1
re	1
living	1
aren	1
t	1
you	1
yes	1
but	1
in	1
debt	1
are	1
you	1
though	1
heavily	1
said	1
bartnyansky	1
sympathetically	1
very	1
heavily	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
bartnyansky	1
broke	1
into	1
good	1
humored	1
laughter	1
oh	1
lucky	1
fellow	1
said	1
he	1
my	1
debts	1
mount	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
million	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
and	1
i	1
ve	1
nothing	1
and	1
still	1
i	1
can	1
live	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
the	1
correctness	1
of	1
this	1
view	1
not	1
in	1
words	1
only	1
but	1
in	1
actual	1
fact	1
zhivahov	1
owed	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
and	1
hadn	1
t	1
a	1
farthing	1
to	1
bless	1
himself	1
with	1
and	1
he	1
lived	1
and	1
in	1
style	1
too	1
count	1
krivtsov	1
was	1
considered	1
a	1
hopeless	1
case	1
by	1
everyone	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
kept	1
two	1
mistresses	1
petrovsky	1
had	1
run	1
through	1
five	1
millions	1
and	1
still	1
lived	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
and	1
was	1
even	1
a	1
manager	1
in	1
the	1
financial	1
department	1
with	1
a	1
salary	1
of	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
but	1
besides	1
this	1
petersburg	1
had	1
physically	1
an	1
agreeable	1
effect	1
on	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
younger	1
in	1
moscow	1
he	1
sometimes	1
found	1
a	1
gray	1
hair	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
dropped	1
asleep	1
after	1
dinner	1
stretched	1
walked	1
slowly	1
upstairs	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
was	1
bored	1
by	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
young	1
women	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
dance	1
at	1
balls	1
in	1
petersburg	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
ten	1
years	1
younger	1
his	1
experience	1
in	1
petersburg	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
described	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
by	1
prince	1
pyotr	1
oblonsky	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sixty	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
abroad	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
live	1
here	1
said	1
pyotr	1
oblonsky	1
i	1
spent	1
the	1
summer	1
in	1
baden	1
and	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
i	1
felt	1
quite	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
at	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
my	1
thoughts	1
one	1
dines	1
and	1
drinks	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
feels	1
strong	1
and	1
ready	1
for	1
anything	1
i	1
came	1
home	1
to	1
russia	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
what	1
s	1
more	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
country	1
place	1
and	1
there	1
you	1
d	1
hardly	1
believe	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
fortnight	1
i	1
d	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
given	1
up	1
dressing	1
for	1
dinner	1
needn	1
t	1
say	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
thoughts	1
left	1
for	1
pretty	1
women	1
i	1
became	1
quite	1
an	1
old	1
gentleman	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
left	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
eternal	1
salvation	1
i	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
paris	1
i	1
was	1
as	1
right	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
at	1
once	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
felt	1
exactly	1
the	1
difference	1
that	1
pyotr	1
oblonsky	1
described	1
in	1
moscow	1
he	1
degenerated	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
for	1
long	1
together	1
he	1
might	1
in	1
good	1
earnest	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
considering	1
his	1
salvation	1
in	1
petersburg	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
again	1
between	1
princess	1
betsy	1
tverskaya	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
there	1
had	1
long	1
existed	1
rather	1
curious	1
relations	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
always	1
flirted	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
jest	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
also	1
in	1
jest	1
the	1
most	1
unseemly	1
things	1
knowing	1
that	1
nothing	1
delighted	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
karenin	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
felt	1
so	1
youthful	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
jesting	1
flirtation	1
and	1
nonsense	1
he	1
recklessly	1
went	1
so	1
far	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
extricate	1
himself	1
as	1
unluckily	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
attracted	1
by	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
positively	1
disagreeable	1
what	1
made	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
attractive	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
considerably	1
relieved	1
at	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
princess	1
myakaya	1
which	1
cut	1
short	1
their	1
tête	1
à	1
tête	1
ah	1
so	1
you	1
re	1
here	1
said	1
she	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
news	1
of	1
your	1
poor	1
sister	1
you	1
needn	1
t	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
like	1
that	1
she	1
added	1
ever	1
since	1
they	1
ve	1
all	1
turned	1
against	1
her	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
re	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
worse	1
than	1
she	1
i	1
ve	1
thought	1
she	1
did	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
thing	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
vronsky	1
for	1
not	1
letting	1
me	1
know	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
petersburg	1
i	1
d	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
gone	1
about	1
with	1
her	1
everywhere	1
please	1
give	1
her	1
my	1
love	1
come	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
her	1
yes	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
she	1
began	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
in	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
accepting	1
as	1
sterling	1
coin	1
princess	1
myakaya	1
s	1
words	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
her	1
princess	1
myakaya	1
interrupted	1
him	1
immediately	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
herself	1
she	1
s	1
done	1
what	1
they	1
all	1
do	1
except	1
me	1
only	1
they	1
hide	1
it	1
but	1
she	1
wouldn	1
t	1
be	1
deceitful	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
better	1
still	1
in	1
throwing	1
up	1
that	1
crazy	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
of	1
yours	1

gave	1
me	1
no	1

at	1
the	1

a	1
queer	1
rather	1

with	1

guessed	1
right	1
thought	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
upstairs	1
curious	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
as	1
well	1
though	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
has	1
immense	1
influence	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
pomorsky	1
the	1
thing	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
certainty	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
quite	1
light	1
out	1
of	1

in	1

drawn	1

at	1
a	1
round	1

under	1
a	1
lamp	1
sat	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
talking	1
softly	1
a	1
short	1
thinnish	1
man	1
very	1
pale	1
and	1
handsome	1
with	1
feminine	1
hips	1
and	1
knock	1
kneed	1
legs	1
with	1
fine	1
brilliant	1
eyes	1
and	1
long	1
hair	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
portraits	1
on	1
the	1

after	1
greeting	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
glancing	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
unknown	1
man	1
monsieur	1
landau	1
the	1
countess	1
addressed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
softness	1
and	1
caution	1
that	1
impressed	1
oblonsky	1
and	1
she	1
introduced	1
them	1
landau	1
looked	1
round	1
hurriedly	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
smiling	1
laid	1
his	1
moist	1
lifeless	1
hand	1
in	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
and	1
immediately	1
walked	1
away	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
portraits	1
again	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
significantly	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
particularly	1
today	1
said	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
pointing	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
to	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
karenin	1
i	1
introduced	1
you	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
landau	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
voice	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
frenchman	1
and	1
again	1
immediately	1
after	1
at	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
count	1
bezzubov	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
probably	1
aware	1
only	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
title	1
yes	1
i	1
heard	1
so	1
answered	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
completely	1
cured	1
countess	1
bezzubova	1
she	1
was	1
here	1
today	1
poor	1
thing	1
the	1
countess	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
this	1
separation	1
is	1
awful	1
for	1
her	1
it	1
s	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
positively	1
is	1
going	1
queried	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
yes	1
he	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
paris	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
yesterday	1
said	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
looking	1
at	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
ah	1
a	1
voice	1
repeated	1
oblonsky	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
as	1
circumspect	1
as	1
he	1
possibly	1
could	1
in	1
this	1
society	1
where	1
something	1
peculiar	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
or	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
key	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
silence	1
followed	1
after	1
which	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
as	1
though	1
approaching	1
the	1
main	1
topic	1
of	1
conversation	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
smile	1
to	1
oblonsky	1
i	1
ve	1
known	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
and	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
closer	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
you	1
les	1
amis	1
de	1

amis	1
sont	1
nos	1
amis	1
	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
true	1
friend	1
one	1
must	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
spiritual	1
state	1
of	1
one	1
s	1
friend	1
and	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
doing	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
you	1
understand	1
what	1
i	1
mean	1
she	1
said	1
lifting	1
her	1
fine	1
pensive	1
eyes	1
in	1
part	1
countess	1
i	1
understand	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
said	1
oblonsky	1
having	1
no	1
clear	1
idea	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
confine	1
himself	1
to	1
generalities	1
the	1
change	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
external	1
position	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
said	1
sternly	1
following	1
with	1
eyes	1
of	1
love	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
crossed	1
over	1
to	1
landau	1
his	1
heart	1
is	1
changed	1
a	1
new	1
heart	1
has	1
been	1
vouchsafed	1
him	1
and	1
i	1
fear	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
fully	1
apprehend	1
the	1
change	1
that	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
him	1
oh	1
well	1
in	1
general	1
outlines	1
i	1
can	1
conceive	1
the	1
change	1
we	1
have	1
always	1
been	1
friendly	1
and	1
now	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
responding	1
with	1
a	1
sympathetic	1
glance	1
to	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
mentally	1
balancing	1
the	1
question	1
with	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ministers	1
she	1
was	1
most	1
intimate	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
know	1
about	1
which	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
change	1
that	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
him	1
cannot	1
lessen	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
neighbors	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
that	1
change	1
can	1
only	1
intensify	1
love	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
me	1
won	1
t	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
tea	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
indicating	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
was	1
handing	1
round	1
tea	1
on	1
a	1
tray	1
not	1
quite	1
countess	1
of	1
course	1
his	1
misfortune	1
yes	1
a	1
misfortune	1
which	1
has	1
proved	1
the	1
highest	1
happiness	1
when	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
made	1
new	1
was	1
filled	1
full	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
gazing	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
at	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
i	1
do	1
believe	1
i	1
might	1
ask	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
thought	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
oh	1
of	1
course	1
countess	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
i	1
imagine	1
such	1
changes	1
are	1
a	1
matter	1
so	1
private	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
friend	1
would	1
care	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
speak	1
freely	1
and	1
help	1
one	1
another	1
yes	1
undoubtedly	1
so	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
difference	1
of	1
convictions	1
and	1
besides	1
said	1
oblonsky	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
smile	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
difference	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
holy	1
truth	1
oh	1
no	1
of	1
course	1
but	1
and	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
paused	1
in	1
confusion	1
he	1
understood	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
religion	1
i	1
fancy	1
he	1
will	1
fall	1
asleep	1
immediately	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
looked	1
round	1
landau	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
and	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
his	1
head	1
drooping	1
noticing	1
that	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
turned	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
smiled	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
childlike	1
artlessness	1
don	1
t	1
take	1
any	1
notice	1
said	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
and	1
she	1
lightly	1
moved	1
a	1
chair	1
up	1
for	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
i	1
have	1
observed	1
she	1
was	1
beginning	1
when	1
a	1
footman	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
rapidly	1
ran	1
her	1
eyes	1
over	1
the	1
note	1
and	1
excusing	1
herself	1
wrote	1
an	1
answer	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
rapidity	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
i	1
have	1
observed	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
that	1
moscow	1
people	1
especially	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
more	1
indifferent	1
to	1
religion	1
than	1
anyone	1
oh	1
no	1
countess	1
i	1
thought	1
moscow	1
people	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
firmest	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
answered	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
you	1
are	1
unfortunately	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
indifferent	1
ones	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
turning	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
weary	1
smile	1
how	1
anyone	1
can	1
be	1
indifferent	1
said	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
indifferent	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
waiting	1
in	1
suspense	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
with	1
his	1
most	1
deprecating	1
smile	1
i	1
hardly	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
such	1
questions	1
has	1
come	1
yet	1
for	1
me	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
tell	1
whether	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
for	1
us	1
or	1
not	1
said	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
severely	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
whether	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
or	1
not	1
ready	1
god	1
s	1
grace	1
is	1
not	1
guided	1
by	1
human	1
considerations	1
sometimes	1
it	1
comes	1
not	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
strive	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
comes	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
unprepared	1
like	1
saul	1
no	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
just	1
yet	1
said	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
meanwhile	1
watching	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
frenchman	1
landau	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
do	1
you	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
listen	1
he	1
asked	1
oh	1
yes	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
disturb	1
you	1
said	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
gazing	1
tenderly	1
at	1
him	1
sit	1
here	1
with	1
us	1
one	1
has	1
only	1
not	1
to	1
close	1
one	1
s	1
eyes	1
to	1
shut	1
out	1
the	1
light	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
went	1
on	1
ah	1
if	1
you	1
knew	1
the	1
happiness	1
we	1
know	1
feeling	1
his	1
presence	1
ever	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
said	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
with	1
a	1
rapturous	1
smile	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
feel	1
himself	1
unworthy	1
sometimes	1
to	1
rise	1
to	1
that	1
height	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
conscious	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
in	1
admitting	1
this	1
religious	1
height	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
unable	1
to	1
bring	1
himself	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
his	1
free	1
thinking	1
views	1
before	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
to	1
pomorsky	1
might	1
procure	1
him	1
the	1
coveted	1
appointment	1
that	1
is	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
sin	1
keeps	1
him	1
back	1
said	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
false	1
idea	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sin	1
for	1
believers	1
their	1
sin	1
has	1
been	1
atoned	1
for	1
pardon	1
	1
she	1
added	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
again	1
with	1
another	1
letter	1
she	1
read	1
it	1

recalling	1
the	1

from	1

alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
addressing	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
reproachfulness	1
in	1
his	1
tone	1
it	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
a	1
subject	1
they	1
had	1
discussed	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
before	1
what	1
harm	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
false	1
interpretation	1
of	1
that	1
passage	1
nothing	1
holds	1
men	1
back	1
from	1

like	1
that	1
misinterpretation	1
i	1
have	1
not	1

so	1
i	1
cannot	1
believe	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
said	1

the	1
very	1
opposite	1
is	1
said	1
striving	1
for	1
god	1
saving	1
the	1
soul	1
by	1
fasting	1

countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
with	1
disgusted	1
contempt	1
those	1
are	1
the	1
crude	1
ideas	1
of	1
our	1
monks	1
yet	1
that	1
is	1
nowhere	1
said	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
simpler	1
and	1
easier	1
she	1
added	1
looking	1
at	1
oblonsky	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
encouraging	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
at	1
court	1
she	1
encouraged	1
youthful	1
maids	1
of	1
honor	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
the	1
new	1
surroundings	1
of	1
the	1

in	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
of	1
approval	1
at	1
her	1
words	1

receiving	1
a	1

in	1
the	1

got	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
through	1
a	1

of	1
books	1

want	1
to	1
read	1
him	1
safe	1
and	1
happy	1
or	1
under	1
the	1

she	1
said	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
karenin	1
and	1
finding	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
again	1

opened	1

the	1

the	1

above	1
all	1
earthly	1
bliss	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
fills	1
the	1
soul	1
the	1
believer	1
cannot	1
be	1
unhappy	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
alone	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
settling	1
herself	1
to	1
read	1
when	1
the	1

came	1
in	1
again	1
madame	1

her	1

putting	1
her	1

in	1
the	1

in	1
the	1

gazing	1
before	1
her	1
with	1

for	1

the	1
happiness	1

oh	1

that	1
is	1
most	1
said	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
glad	1
they	1
were	1
going	1

him	1
have	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1

he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
alexey	1

exchanged	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
felt	1
completely	1
nonplussed	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
talk	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
hearing	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
complexity	1
of	1
petersburg	1
as	1
a	1
rule	1
had	1
a	1
stimulating	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
rousing	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
moscow	1
stagnation	1
but	1
he	1
liked	1
these	1
complications	1
and	1
understood	1
them	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
circles	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
in	1
these	1
unfamiliar	1
surroundings	1
he	1
was	1
puzzled	1
and	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
his	1
bearings	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
artless	1
or	1
perhaps	1
artful	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
decide	1
which	1
eyes	1
of	1
landau	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
heaviness	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
most	1
incongruous	1

what	1
s	1
he	1
bezzubov	1
for	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw	1
was	1
uncontrollably	1
forming	1
a	1
yawn	1
he	1
pulled	1
his	1
whiskers	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
yawn	1
and	1
shook	1
himself	1
together	1
but	1
soon	1
after	1
he	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dropping	1
asleep	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
of	1
snoring	1
he	1
recovered	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
was	1
saying	1
he	1

asleep	1

arkadyevitch	1
started	1
with	1
dismay	1
feeling	1
guilty	1
and	1
caught	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
reassured	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
s	1
asleep	1
referred	1
not	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
to	1
landau	1
the	1
frenchman	1
was	1
asleep	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
but	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
being	1
asleep	1
would	1
have	1
offended	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
though	1
even	1
this	1
he	1
thought	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
as	1
everything	1
seemed	1
so	1
queer	1

in	1
again	1
not	1

the	1

up	1

himself	1
up	1

	1
and	1
receiving	1
an	1

in	1

stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
forgetting	1
the	1
favor	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1

of	1

and	1
forgetting	1
his	1

the	1

away	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
as	1
though	1
from	1
a	1
plague	1
stricken	1
house	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
chatted	1
and	1
joked	1
with	1
his	1
cab	1
driver	1
trying	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
spirits	1
at	1
the	1
french	1
theater	1
where	1
he	1
arrived	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
act	1
and	1
afterwards	1
at	1
the	1
tatar	1
restaurant	1
after	1
his	1
champagne	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
refreshed	1
in	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
felt	1
quite	1
unlike	1
himself	1
all	1
that	1
evening	1
on	1
getting	1
home	1
to	1
pyotr	1
oblonsky	1
s	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
staying	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
found	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
betsy	1
she	1
wrote	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
finish	1
their	1
interrupted	1
conversation	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
scarcely	1
read	1
this	1
note	1
and	1
frowned	1
at	1
its	1
contents	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
below	1
the	1
ponderous	1
tramp	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
carrying	1
something	1
heavy	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
rejuvenated	1
pyotr	1
oblonsky	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
drunk	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
walk	1
upstairs	1
but	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
legs	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
and	1
clinging	1
to	1
him	1
walked	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep	1
doing	1
so	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
in	1
very	1
low	1
spirits	1
which	1
happened	1
rarely	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
everything	1
he	1
could	1
recall	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
everything	1
was	1
disgusting	1
but	1
most	1
disgusting	1
of	1
all	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
shameful	1
was	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
at	1
countess	1
lidia	1
ivanovna	1
s	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
received	1
from	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
a	1
final	1
answer	1
refusing	1
to	1
grant	1
anna	1
s	1
divorce	1
and	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
decision	1
was	1
based	1
on	1
what	1
the	1
frenchman	1
had	1
said	1
in	1
his	1

both	1

late	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
agreement	1
between	1
them	1
the	1
irritability	1
that	1
kept	1
them	1
apart	1
had	1
no	1
external	1
cause	1
and	1
all	1
efforts	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
understanding	1
intensified	1
it	1
instead	1
of	1
removing	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
inner	1
irritation	1
grounded	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
on	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
his	1
love	1
had	1
grown	1
less	1
in	1
his	1
on	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
himself	1
for	1
her	1
sake	1
in	1
a	1
difficult	1
position	1
which	1
she	1
instead	1
of	1
lightening	1
made	1
still	1
more	1
difficult	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
gave	1
full	1
utterance	1
to	1
their	1
sense	1
of	1
grievance	1
but	1
they	1
considered	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
and	1
tried	1
on	1
every	1
pretext	1
to	1
prove	1
this	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
habits	1
ideas	1
desires	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
spiritual	1
and	1
physical	1
temperament	1
was	1
one	1
thing	1
love	1
for	1
women	1
and	1
that	1
love	1
she	1
felt	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
concentrated	1
on	1
her	1
alone	1
that	1
love	1
was	1
less	1
consequently	1
as	1
she	1
reasoned	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
transferred	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
to	1
other	1
women	1
or	1
to	1
another	1
woman	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
not	1
of	1
any	1
particular	1
woman	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
decrease	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
not	1
having	1
got	1
an	1
object	1
for	1
her	1
jealousy	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
slightest	1
hint	1
she	1
transferred	1
her	1
jealousy	1
from	1
one	1
object	1
to	1
another	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
those	1
low	1
women	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
so	1
easily	1
renew	1
his	1
old	1
bachelor	1
ties	1
then	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
women	1
he	1
might	1
meet	1
then	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
the	1
imaginary	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
want	1
to	1
marry	1
for	1
whose	1
sake	1
he	1
would	1
break	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
this	1
last	1
form	1
of	1
jealousy	1
tortured	1
her	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
unwarily	1
told	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
frankness	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
knew	1
him	1
so	1
little	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
audacity	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
young	1
princess	1
sorokina	1
and	1
being	1
jealous	1
of	1
him	1
anna	1
was	1
indignant	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
found	1
grounds	1
for	1
indignation	1
in	1
everything	1
for	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
difficult	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
she	1
blamed	1
him	1
the	1
agonizing	1
condition	1
of	1
suspense	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
in	1
moscow	1
the	1
tardiness	1
and	1
indecision	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
her	1
solitude	1
she	1
put	1
it	1
all	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
loved	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
rescued	1
her	1
from	1
it	1
for	1
her	1
being	1
in	1
moscow	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
too	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
do	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
society	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
this	1
awful	1
position	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
again	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
fault	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
forever	1
separated	1
from	1
her	1
son	1
even	1
the	1
rare	1
moments	1
of	1
tenderness	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
did	1
not	1
soothe	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
tenderness	1
now	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
complacency	1
of	1
self	1
confidence	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
which	1
exasperated	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
dusk	1
anna	1
was	1
alone	1
and	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
a	1
bachelor	1
dinner	1
she	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
noise	1
from	1
the	1
street	1
was	1
least	1
heard	1
and	1
thought	1
over	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
their	1
yesterday	1
s	1
quarrel	1
going	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
well	1
remembered	1
offensive	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
quarrel	1
to	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
arrived	1
at	1
last	1
at	1
its	1
origin	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
that	1
their	1
dissension	1
had	1
arisen	1
from	1
a	1
conversation	1
so	1
inoffensive	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
moment	1
to	1
either	1
but	1
so	1
it	1
actually	1
had	1
been	1
it	1
all	1
arose	1
from	1
his	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
girls	1
high	1
schools	1
declaring	1
they	1
were	1
useless	1
while	1
she	1
defended	1
them	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
slightingly	1
of	1
women	1
s	1
education	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
hannah	1
anna	1
s	1
english	1
protégée	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
need	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
physics	1
this	1
irritated	1
anna	1
she	1
saw	1
in	1
this	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
reference	1
to	1
her	1
occupations	1
and	1
she	1
bethought	1
her	1
of	1
a	1
phrase	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
expect	1
you	1
to	1
understand	1
me	1
my	1
feelings	1
as	1
anyone	1
who	1
loved	1
me	1
might	1
but	1
simple	1
delicacy	1
i	1
did	1
expect	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
actually	1
flushed	1
with	1
vexation	1
and	1
had	1
said	1
something	1
unpleasant	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
recall	1
her	1
answer	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
with	1
an	1
unmistakable	1
desire	1
to	1
wound	1
her	1
too	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
i	1
feel	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
your	1
infatuation	1
over	1
this	1
girl	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
because	1
i	1
see	1
it	1
s	1
unnatural	1
the	1
cruelty	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
shattered	1
the	1
world	1
she	1
had	1
built	1
up	1
for	1
herself	1
so	1
laboriously	1
to	1
enable	1
her	1
to	1
endure	1
her	1
hard	1
life	1
the	1
injustice	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
accused	1
her	1
of	1
affectation	1
of	1
artificiality	1
aroused	1
her	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
s	1
coarse	1
and	1
material	1
is	1
comprehensible	1
and	1
natural	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
yesterday	1
evening	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
quarrel	1
but	1
both	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
quarrel	1
had	1
been	1
smoothed	1
over	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
today	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
home	1
all	1
day	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
so	1
lonely	1
and	1
wretched	1
in	1
being	1
on	1
bad	1
terms	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
forget	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
and	1
be	1
reconciled	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
herself	1
and	1
to	1
justify	1
him	1
i	1
am	1
myself	1
to	1
blame	1
i	1
m	1
irritable	1
i	1
m	1
insanely	1
jealous	1
i	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
there	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
at	1
peace	1
unnatural	1
she	1
suddenly	1
recalled	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
had	1
stung	1
her	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
word	1
itself	1
as	1
the	1
intent	1
to	1
wound	1
her	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
he	1
meant	1
unnatural	1
not	1
loving	1
my	1
own	1
daughter	1
to	1
love	1
another	1
person	1
s	1
child	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
know	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
children	1
of	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
seryozha	1
whom	1
i	1
ve	1
sacrificed	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
that	1
wish	1
to	1
wound	1
me	1
no	1
he	1
loves	1
another	1
woman	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
while	1
trying	1
to	1
regain	1
her	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
round	1
the	1
same	1
circle	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
round	1
so	1
often	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
former	1
state	1
of	1
exasperation	1
she	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
herself	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
impossible	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
beyond	1
me	1
to	1
control	1
myself	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
began	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
he	1
s	1
truthful	1
he	1
s	1
honest	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
i	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
the	1
divorce	1
will	1
come	1
what	1
more	1
do	1
i	1
want	1
i	1
want	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
trust	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
myself	1
yes	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
in	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
him	1
i	1
was	1
wrong	1
though	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
wrong	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
away	1
tomorrow	1
and	1
to	1
escape	1
thinking	1
any	1
more	1
and	1
being	1
overcome	1
by	1
irritability	1
she	1
rang	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
boxes	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
up	1
for	1
packing	1
their	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
vronsky	1
came	1
in	1
chapter	1
24	1
well	1
was	1
it	1
nice	1
she	1
asked	1
coming	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
penitent	1
and	1
meek	1
expression	1
just	1
as	1
usual	1
he	1
answered	1
seeing	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
good	1
moods	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
by	1
now	1
to	1
these	1
transitions	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
particularly	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
today	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
specially	1
good	1
humor	1
himself	1
what	1
do	1
i	1
see	1
come	1
that	1
s	1
good	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
boxes	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
yes	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
i	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
drive	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
fine	1
i	1
longed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
is	1
there	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
i	1
desire	1
i	1
ll	1
be	1
back	1
directly	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
i	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
coat	1
order	1
some	1
tea	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
mortifying	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
come	1
that	1
s	1
good	1
as	1
one	1
says	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
it	1
leaves	1
off	1
being	1
naughty	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
mortifying	1
was	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
her	1
penitent	1
and	1
his	1
self	1
confident	1
tone	1
and	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
she	1
felt	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
strife	1
rising	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
again	1
but	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
she	1
conquered	1
it	1
and	1
met	1
vronsky	1
as	1
good	1
humoredly	1
as	1
before	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
partly	1
repeating	1
phrases	1
she	1
had	1
prepared	1
beforehand	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
her	1
plans	1
for	1
going	1
away	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
almost	1
like	1
an	1
inspiration	1
she	1
said	1
why	1
wait	1
here	1
for	1
the	1
divorce	1
won	1
t	1
it	1
be	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
wait	1
any	1
longer	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
hoping	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
divorce	1
i	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
any	1
more	1
influence	1
on	1
my	1
life	1
do	1
you	1
agree	1
oh	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
glancing	1
uneasily	1
at	1
her	1
excited	1
face	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
who	1
was	1
there	1
she	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
vronsky	1
mentioned	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
guests	1
the	1
dinner	1
was	1
first	1
rate	1
and	1
the	1
boat	1
race	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
pleasant	1
enough	1
but	1
in	1
moscow	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
do	1
anything	1
without	1
something	1
ridicule	1
a	1
lady	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
teacher	1
of	1
swimming	1
to	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
sweden	1
and	1
gave	1
us	1
an	1
exhibition	1
of	1
her	1
skill	1
how	1
did	1
she	1
swim	1
asked	1
anna	1
frowning	1
in	1
an	1
absurd	1
red	1
costume	1
de	1
natation	1
	1
she	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
hideous	1
too	1
so	1
when	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
what	1
an	1
absurd	1
fancy	1
why	1
did	1
she	1
swim	1
in	1
some	1
special	1
way	1
then	1
said	1
anna	1
not	1
answering	1
there	1
was	1
absolutely	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
i	1

for	1

that	1
could	1
be	1

for	1
an	1
instant	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
clear	1
vision	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
resolution	1
but	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
own	1
ruin	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
herself	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
herself	1
from	1
proving	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1

wrong	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
never	1

that	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
sympathize	1
with	1
this	1
sudden	1
passion	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
though	1
you	1
boast	1
of	1
your	1
straightforwardness	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
i	1
never	1
boast	1
and	1
i	1
never	1
tell	1
lies	1
he	1
said	1
slowly	1
restraining	1
his	1
rising	1
anger	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
great	1
pity	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
respect	1
respect	1
was	1
invented	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
empty	1
place	1
where	1

should	1
be	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
love	1
me	1
any	1
more	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
and	1
more	1
honest	1
to	1
say	1
so	1
no	1
this	1
is	1
becoming	1
unbearable	1
cried	1
vronsky	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
stopping	1
short	1
facing	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
speaking	1
deliberately	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
try	1
my	1
patience	1
for	1
looking	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
much	1
more	1
but	1
was	1
restraining	1
himself	1
it	1
has	1
limits	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
that	1
she	1
cried	1
looking	1
with	1
terror	1
at	1
the	1
undisguised	1
hatred	1
in	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
his	1
cruel	1
menacing	1
eyes	1
i	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
he	1
checked	1
himself	1
i	1
must	1
ask	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
me	1
what	1
can	1
i	1
want	1
all	1
i	1
can	1
want	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
desert	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
doing	1
she	1
said	1
understanding	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
uttered	1
but	1
that	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
that	1
s	1
secondary	1
i	1
want	1
love	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
so	1
then	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
she	1
turned	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
stop	1
sto	1
op	1
said	1
vronsky	1
with	1
no	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
gloomy	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
brows	1
though	1
he	1
held	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
about	1
i	1
said	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
off	1
going	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
lying	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
honorable	1
man	1
yes	1
and	1
i	1
repeat	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
reproaches	1
me	1
with	1
having	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
recalling	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
still	1
earlier	1
quarrel	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
worse	1
than	1
a	1
dishonorable	1
man	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
heartless	1
man	1
oh	1
there	1
are	1
limits	1
to	1
endurance	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
hastily	1
let	1
go	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
hates	1
me	1
that	1
s	1
clear	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
without	1
looking	1
round	1
she	1
walked	1
with	1
faltering	1
steps	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
loves	1
another	1
woman	1
that	1
s	1
even	1
clearer	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
i	1
want	1
love	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
so	1
then	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
she	1
repeated	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
ended	1
but	1
how	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
chair	1
before	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
thoughts	1
of	1
where	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
now	1
whether	1
to	1
the	1
aunt	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
up	1
to	1
dolly	1
or	1
simply	1
alone	1
abroad	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
now	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
whether	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
final	1
quarrel	1
or	1
whether	1
reconciliation	1
were	1
still	1
possible	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
all	1
her	1
old	1
friends	1
at	1
petersburg	1
would	1
say	1
of	1
her	1
now	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
ideas	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
now	1
after	1
this	1
rupture	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
some	1
obscure	1
idea	1
that	1
alone	1
interested	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
clear	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
thinking	1
once	1
more	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
illness	1
after	1
her	1
confinement	1
and	1
the	1
feeling	1
which	1
never	1
left	1
her	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1
i	1
die	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
yes	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
idea	1
which	1
alone	1
solved	1
all	1
yes	1
to	1
die	1
and	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
disgrace	1
of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
and	1
of	1
seryozha	1
and	1
my	1
awful	1
shame	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
saved	1
by	1
death	1
to	1
die	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
feel	1
remorse	1
will	1
be	1
sorry	1
will	1
love	1
me	1
he	1
will	1
suffer	1
on	1
my	1
account	1
with	1
the	1
trace	1
of	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
commiseration	1
for	1
herself	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
armchair	1
taking	1
off	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
the	1
rings	1
on	1
her	1
left	1
hand	1
vividly	1
picturing	1
from	1
different	1
sides	1
his	1
feelings	1
after	1
her	1
death	1
approaching	1
footsteps	1
his	1
steps	1
distracted	1
her	1
attention	1
as	1
though	1
absorbed	1
in	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
her	1
rings	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
said	1
softly	1
anna	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
i	1
agree	1
to	1
everything	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
urged	1
you	1
know	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
herself	1
any	1
longer	1
she	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs	1
cast	1
me	1
off	1
she	1
articulated	1
between	1
her	1
sobs	1
i	1
ll	1
go	1
away	1
tomorrow	1
i	1
ll	1
do	1
more	1

someone	1

vronsky	1
besought	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
declared	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
foundation	1
for	1
her	1
jealousy	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
ceased	1
and	1
never	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
anna	1
why	1
distress	1
yourself	1
and	1
me	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
kissing	1
her	1
hands	1
there	1
was	1
tenderness	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
fancied	1
she	1
caught	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
them	1
wet	1
on	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
instantly	1
anna	1
s	1
despairing	1
jealousy	1
changed	1
to	1
a	1
despairing	1
passion	1
of	1
tenderness	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
kisses	1
his	1
head	1
his	1
neck	1
his	1
hands	1
chapter	1

feeling	1
that	1
the	1
reconciliation	1
was	1
complete	1
anna	1
set	1
eagerly	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
preparing	1
for	1
their	1
departure	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
settled	1
whether	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
on	1
monday	1
or	1
tuesday	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
each	1
given	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
anna	1
packed	1
busily	1
feeling	1
absolutely	1
indifferent	1
whether	1
they	1
went	1
a	1
day	1
earlier	1
or	1
later	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
over	1
an	1
open	1
box	1
taking	1
things	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
earlier	1
than	1

to	1
go	1
out	1
i	1

yegorov	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
ready	1

he	1
said	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
mood	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
his	1

her	1
a	1
pang	1
no	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1

by	1
then	1
myself	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
reflected	1
so	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
arrange	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
i	1
wished	1

only	1
to	1

she	1
said	1
putting	1
something	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
frippery	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
annushka	1
s	1
arms	1
vronsky	1

eating	1
his	1
beefsteak	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
how	1
distasteful	1
these	1
rooms	1
have	1
become	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
coffee	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
more	1
awful	1
than	1
these	1

s	1
no	1
individuality	1
in	1
them	1
no	1

and	1
worst	1
of	1

so	1
it	1
s	1
really	1
to	1
be	1
tomorrow	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
voice	1
but	1
suddenly	1
her	1
face	1
changed	1
vronsky	1
s	1
valet	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
sign	1
a	1
receipt	1
for	1
a	1
telegram	1
from	1
petersburg	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
vronsky	1
s	1
getting	1
a	1
telegram	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
though	1
anxious	1
to	1
conceal	1
something	1
from	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
receipt	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
tomorrow	1
without	1
fail	1
i	1
will	1
finish	1
it	1
all	1
from	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
telegram	1
she	1
asked	1
not	1
hearing	1
him	1
from	1
stiva	1
he	1
answered	1
reluctantly	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
what	1
secret	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
between	1
stiva	1
and	1
me	1
vronsky	1
called	1
the	1
valet	1
back	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
telegram	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
because	1
stiva	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
passion	1
for	1
telegraphing	1
why	1
telegraph	1
when	1
nothing	1
is	1
settled	1
about	1
the	1
divorce	1
yes	1
but	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
anything	1
yet	1
he	1
has	1
promised	1
a	1
decisive	1
answer	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
but	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
read	1
it	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands	1
anna	1
took	1
the	1
telegram	1
and	1
read	1
what	1
vronsky	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
added	1
little	1
hope	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
do	1
everything	1
possible	1
and	1
impossible	1
i	1
said	1
yesterday	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
absolutely	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
get	1
or	1
whether	1
i	1
never	1
get	1
a	1
divorce	1
she	1
said	1
flushing	1
crimson	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
necessity	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
me	1
so	1
he	1
may	1
hide	1
and	1
does	1
hide	1
his	1
correspondence	1
with	1
women	1
from	1
me	1
she	1
thought	1
yashvin	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
this	1
morning	1
with	1
voytov	1
said	1
vronsky	1
i	1
believe	1
he	1
s	1
won	1
from	1
pyevtsov	1
all	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
can	1
pay	1
about	1
sixty	1
thousand	1
no	1
she	1
said	1
irritated	1
by	1
his	1
so	1
obviously	1
showing	1
by	1
this	1
change	1
of	1
subject	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
irritated	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
this	1
news	1
would	1
affect	1
me	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
even	1
try	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
liked	1
you	1
to	1
care	1
as	1
little	1
about	1
it	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
i	1
care	1
about	1
it	1
because	1
i	1
like	1
definiteness	1
he	1
said	1
definiteness	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
but	1
the	1
love	1
she	1
said	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
irritated	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
cool	1
composure	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
spoke	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
god	1
love	1
again	1
he	1
thought	1
frowning	1
oh	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
for	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
and	1
your	1
children	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
there	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
great	1
pity	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
want	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
sake	1
but	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
or	1
not	1
having	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
having	1
children	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
dispute	1
and	1
irritation	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
children	1
she	1
interpreted	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
prize	1
her	1
beauty	1
oh	1
i	1
said	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
above	1
all	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
he	1
repeated	1
frowning	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
pain	1
because	1
i	1
am	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
your	1
irritability	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
indefiniteness	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
yes	1
now	1
he	1
has	1
laid	1
aside	1
all	1
pretense	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
cold	1
hatred	1
for	1
me	1
is	1
apparent	1
she	1
thought	1
not	1
hearing	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
watching	1
with	1
terror	1
the	1
cold	1
cruel	1
judge	1
who	1
looked	1
mocking	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
the	1
cause	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
indeed	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
irritability	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
completely	1
in	1
your	1
power	1
what	1
indefiniteness	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
that	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
understand	1
he	1
interrupted	1
obstinately	1
anxious	1
to	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
his	1
thought	1
the	1
indefiniteness	1
consists	1
in	1
your	1
imagining	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
free	1
on	1
that	1
score	1
you	1
can	1
set	1
your	1
mind	1
quite	1
at	1
rest	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
began	1
drinking	1
her	1
coffee	1
she	1
lifted	1
her	1
cup	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
finger	1
held	1
apart	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
after	1
drinking	1
a	1
few	1
sips	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
expression	1
she	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
repelled	1
by	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
her	1
gesture	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
made	1
by	1
her	1
lips	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
what	1
your	1
mother	1
thinks	1
and	1
what	1
match	1
she	1
wants	1
to	1
make	1
for	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
putting	1
the	1
cup	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
shaking	1
hand	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
talking	1
about	1
that	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
a	1
heartless	1
woman	1
whether	1
she	1
s	1
old	1
or	1
not	1
old	1
your	1
mother	1
or	1
anyone	1
else	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
anna	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
disrespectfully	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
a	1
woman	1
whose	1
heart	1
does	1
not	1
tell	1
her	1
where	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
happiness	1
and	1
honor	1
lie	1
has	1
no	1
heart	1
i	1
repeat	1
my	1
request	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
speak	1
disrespectfully	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
whom	1
i	1
respect	1
he	1
said	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
looking	1
sternly	1
at	1
her	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
his	1
hands	1
she	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
their	1
reconciliation	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
and	1
his	1
passionate	1
caresses	1
there	1
just	1
such	1
caresses	1
he	1
has	1
lavished	1
and	1
will	1
lavish	1
and	1
longs	1
to	1
lavish	1
on	1
other	1
women	1
she	1
thought	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
love	1
your	1
mother	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
talk	1
and	1
talk	1
and	1
talk	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
hatred	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
even	1
if	1
so	1
you	1
must	1
must	1
decide	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
decided	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
away	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
yashvin	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
anna	1
greeted	1
him	1
and	1
remained	1
why	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tempest	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
a	1
turning	1
point	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
fearful	1
consequences	1
why	1
at	1
that	1
minute	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
appearances	1
before	1
an	1
outsider	1
who	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
must	1
know	1
it	1
all	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
at	1
once	1
quelling	1
the	1
storm	1
within	1
her	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
their	1
guest	1
well	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
getting	1
on	1
has	1
your	1
debt	1
been	1
paid	1
you	1
she	1
asked	1
yashvin	1
oh	1
pretty	1
fair	1
i	1
fancy	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1
get	1
it	1
all	1
but	1
i	1
shall	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
half	1
and	1
when	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
said	1
yashvin	1
looking	1
at	1
vronsky	1
and	1
unmistakably	1
guessing	1
at	1
a	1
quarrel	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
i	1
think	1
said	1
vronsky	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
so	1
long	1
though	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
quite	1
decided	1
said	1
anna	1
looking	1
vronsky	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
which	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
dream	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
reconciliation	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
feel	1
sorry	1
for	1
that	1
unlucky	1
pyevtsov	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
to	1
yashvin	1
i	1
ve	1
never	1
asked	1
myself	1
the	1
question	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
whether	1
i	1
m	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
or	1
not	1
you	1
see	1
all	1
my	1
fortune	1
s	1
here	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
breast	1
pocket	1
and	1
just	1
now	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
wealthy	1
man	1
but	1
today	1
i	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
and	1
i	1
may	1
come	1
out	1
a	1
beggar	1
you	1
see	1
whoever	1
sits	1
down	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
shirt	1
to	1
my	1
back	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
i	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
fight	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
it	1
well	1
but	1
suppose	1
you	1
were	1
married	1
said	1
anna	1
how	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
your	1
wife	1
yashvin	1
laughed	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
married	1
and	1
never	1
mean	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
helsingfors	1
said	1
vronsky	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
anna	1
s	1
smiling	1
face	1
meeting	1
his	1
eyes	1
anna	1
s	1
face	1
instantly	1
took	1
a	1
coldly	1
severe	1
expression	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
saying	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
forgotten	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
were	1
you	1
really	1
in	1
love	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
yashvin	1
oh	1
heavens	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
times	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
some	1
men	1
can	1
play	1
but	1
only	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
always	1
lay	1
down	1
their	1
cards	1
when	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
a	1
rendezvous	1
comes	1
while	1
i	1
can	1
take	1
up	1
love	1
but	1
only	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
late	1
for	1
my	1
cards	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
that	1
s	1
how	1
i	1
manage	1
things	1
no	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
mean	1
that	1
but	1
the	1
real	1
thing	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
helsingfors	1
but	1
would	1
not	1
repeat	1
the	1
word	1
used	1
by	1
vronsky	1
voytov	1
who	1
was	1
buying	1
the	1
horse	1
came	1
in	1
anna	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
leaving	1
the	1
house	1
vronsky	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
looking	1
for	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
but	1
ashamed	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
pretense	1
she	1
looked	1
straight	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
cold	1
eyes	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
she	1
asked	1
in	1
french	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
guarantee	1
for	1
gambetta	1
i	1
ve	1
sold	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
said	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
words	1
i	1
ve	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
discussing	1
things	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
he	1
thought	1
if	1
she	1
will	1
punish	1
herself	1
tant	1
pis	1
pour	1
elle	1
	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
something	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
suddenly	1
ached	1
with	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
eh	1
anna	1
he	1
queried	1
i	1
said	1
nothing	1
she	1
answered	1
just	1
as	1
coldly	1
and	1
calmly	1
oh	1
nothing	1
tant	1
pis	1
then	1
he	1
thought	1
feeling	1
cold	1
again	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
out	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
white	1
with	1
quivering	1
lips	1
he	1
even	1
wanted	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
some	1
comforting	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
his	1
legs	1
carried	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
spent	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
maid	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
anna	1
arkadyevna	1
had	1
a	1
headache	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
chapter	1
26	1
never	1
before	1
had	1
a	1
day	1
been	1
passed	1
in	1
quarrel	1
today	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
quarrel	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
open	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
complete	1
coldness	1
was	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
glanced	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
guarantee	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
see	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
breaking	1
with	1
despair	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
that	1
face	1
of	1
callous	1
composure	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
hated	1
her	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
another	1
woman	1
that	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
remembering	1
all	1
the	1
cruel	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
anna	1
supplied	1
too	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
unmistakably	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
exasperated	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
prevent	1
you	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
where	1
you	1
like	1
you	1
were	1
unwilling	1
to	1
be	1
divorced	1
from	1
your	1
husband	1
no	1
doubt	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
money	1
i	1
ll	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
how	1
many	1
roubles	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
all	1
the	1
most	1
cruel	1
words	1
that	1
a	1
brutal	1
man	1
could	1
say	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
forgive	1
him	1
for	1
them	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
actually	1
said	1
them	1
but	1
didn	1
t	1
he	1
only	1
yesterday	1
swear	1
he	1
loved	1
me	1
he	1
a	1
truthful	1
and	1
sincere	1
man	1
haven	1
t	1
i	1
despaired	1
for	1
nothing	1
many	1
times	1
already	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
afterwards	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
wilson	1
s	1
which	1
occupied	1
two	1
hours	1
anna	1
spent	1
in	1
doubts	1
whether	1
everything	1
were	1
over	1
or	1
whether	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
hope	1
of	1
reconciliation	1
whether	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
or	1
see	1
him	1
once	1
more	1
she	1
was	1
expecting	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
leaving	1
a	1
message	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
her	1
head	1
ached	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
if	1
he	1
comes	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
maid	1
says	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
still	1
if	1
not	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
will	1
decide	1
what	1
i	1
m	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
rumbling	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
stop	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
his	1
ring	1
his	1
steps	1
and	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
servant	1
he	1
believed	1
what	1
was	1
told	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
more	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
so	1
then	1
everything	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
death	1
rose	1
clearly	1
and	1
vividly	1
before	1
her	1
mind	1
as	1
the	1
sole	1
means	1
of	1
bringing	1
back	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
of	1
punishing	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
gaining	1
the	1
victory	1
in	1
that	1
strife	1
which	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
waging	1
with	1
him	1
now	1
nothing	1
mattered	1
going	1
or	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
vozdvizhenskoe	1
getting	1
or	1
not	1
getting	1
a	1
divorce	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
all	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
matter	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
mattered	1
was	1
punishing	1
him	1
when	1
she	1
poured	1
herself	1
out	1
her	1
usual	1
dose	1
of	1
opium	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
drink	1
off	1
the	1
whole	1
bottle	1
to	1
die	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
that	1
she	1
began	1
musing	1
with	1
enjoyment	1
on	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
suffer	1
and	1
repent	1
and	1
love	1
her	1
memory	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
she	1
lay	1
in	1
bed	1
with	1
open	1
eyes	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
burned	1
down	1
candle	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
carved	1
cornice	1
of	1
the	1
ceiling	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
screen	1
that	1
covered	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
while	1
she	1
vividly	1
pictured	1
to	1
herself	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
feel	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
memory	1
to	1
him	1
how	1
could	1
i	1
say	1
such	1
cruel	1
things	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
how	1
could	1
i	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
she	1
has	1
gone	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
forever	1
she	1
is	1
suddenly	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
screen	1
wavered	1
pounced	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
cornice	1
the	1
whole	1
ceiling	1
other	1
shadows	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
swooped	1
to	1
meet	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
shadows	1
flitted	1
back	1
but	1
then	1
with	1
fresh	1
swiftness	1
they	1
darted	1
forward	1
wavered	1
commingled	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
darkness	1
death	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
such	1
horror	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
realize	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
her	1
trembling	1
hands	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
matches	1
and	1
light	1
another	1
candle	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
burned	1
down	1
and	1
gone	1
out	1
no	1
anything	1
only	1
to	1
live	1
why	1
i	1
love	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
before	1
and	1
will	1
pass	1
she	1
said	1
feeling	1
that	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
return	1
to	1
life	1
were	1
trickling	1
down	1
her	1
cheeks	1
and	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
her	1
panic	1
she	1
went	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
asleep	1
there	1
and	1
sleeping	1
soundly	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
holding	1
the	1
light	1
above	1
his	1
face	1
she	1
gazed	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
at	1
him	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
asleep	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
back	1
tears	1
of	1
tenderness	1
but	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
waked	1
up	1
he	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
cold	1
eyes	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
that	1
before	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
wrong	1
in	1
his	1
treatment	1
of	1
her	1
without	1
waking	1
him	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
second	1
dose	1
of	1
opium	1
she	1
fell	1
towards	1
morning	1
into	1
a	1
heavy	1
incomplete	1
sleep	1
during	1
which	1
she	1
never	1
quite	1
lost	1
consciousness	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
she	1
was	1
waked	1
by	1
a	1
horrible	1
nightmare	1
which	1
had	1
recurred	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
her	1
dreams	1
even	1
before	1
her	1
connection	1
with	1
vronsky	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
unkempt	1
beard	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
bent	1
down	1
over	1
some	1
iron	1
muttering	1
meaningless	1
french	1
words	1
and	1
she	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
in	1
this	1
nightmare	1
it	1
was	1
what	1
made	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
it	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
peasant	1
was	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
horrible	1
with	1
the	1
iron	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
waked	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
sweat	1
when	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
veiled	1
in	1
mist	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
quarrel	1
just	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
several	1
times	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
headache	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
re	1
going	1
away	1
i	1
must	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
get	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
learning	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
carriage	1
stop	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
carriage	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
lilac	1
hat	1
was	1
leaning	1
out	1
giving	1
some	1
direction	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
ringing	1
the	1
bell	1
after	1
a	1
parley	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
someone	1
came	1
upstairs	1
and	1
vronsky	1
s	1
steps	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
passing	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
went	1
rapidly	1
downstairs	1
anna	1
went	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
come	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
without	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
the	1
young	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
lilac	1
hat	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
parcel	1
vronsky	1
smiling	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
carriage	1
drove	1
away	1
he	1
ran	1
rapidly	1
upstairs	1
again	1
the	1
mists	1
that	1
had	1
shrouded	1
everything	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
parted	1
suddenly	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
yesterday	1
pierced	1
the	1
sick	1
heart	1
with	1
a	1
fresh	1
pang	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
now	1
how	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
lowered	1
herself	1
by	1
spending	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
to	1
announce	1
her	1
determination	1
that	1
was	1
madame	1
sorokina	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
the	1
deeds	1
from	1
maman	1
i	1
couldn	1
t	1
get	1
them	1
yesterday	1
how	1
is	1
your	1
head	1
better	1
he	1
said	1
quietly	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
gloomy	1
and	1
solemn	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
looked	1
silently	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
frowned	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
a	1
letter	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
deliberately	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
still	1
might	1
have	1
turned	1
her	1
back	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
silent	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
sound	1
audible	1
was	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
the	1
note	1
paper	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
it	1
oh	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
we	1
re	1
going	1
tomorrow	1
for	1
certain	1
aren	1
t	1
we	1
you	1
but	1
not	1
i	1
she	1
said	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
him	1
anna	1
we	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
you	1
but	1
not	1
i	1
she	1
repeated	1
this	1
is	1
getting	1
unbearable	1
you	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
this	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
frightened	1
by	1
the	1
desperate	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
uttered	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
run	1
after	1
her	1
but	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
scowled	1
setting	1
his	1
teeth	1
this	1
vulgar	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
threat	1
of	1
something	1
vague	1
exasperated	1
him	1
i	1
ve	1
tried	1
everything	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
left	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
pay	1
attention	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
to	1
drive	1
into	1
town	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
signature	1
to	1
the	1
deeds	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
steps	1
about	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
stood	1
still	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
he	1
merely	1
gave	1
an	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
horse	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
voytov	1
if	1
he	1
came	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
away	1
then	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
carriage	1
brought	1
round	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
again	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
again	1
and	1
someone	1
was	1
running	1
upstairs	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
valet	1
running	1
up	1
for	1
his	1
gloves	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
saw	1
him	1
take	1
the	1
gloves	1
without	1
looking	1
and	1
touching	1
the	1
coachman	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
then	1
without	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
he	1
settled	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
attitude	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
crossed	1
and	1
drawing	1
on	1
his	1
gloves	1
he	1
vanished	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
chapter	1
27	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
it	1
is	1
over	1
anna	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
statement	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
when	1
the	1

cried	1
and	1
crossing	1
the	1

rang	1

was	1
so	1
afraid	1
now	1
of	1

alone	1
that	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
servant	1
to	1

out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1

where	1
the	1
count	1

gone	1
she	1
said	1
the	1

answered	1
that	1
the	1

gone	1
to	1
the	1
stable	1

sealed	1

up	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
left	1
alone	1
now	1
she	1
followed	1
the	1
servant	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

to	1
the	1

first	1

when	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
chubby	1
rosy	1
little	1
girl	1
with	1
her	1
black	1
curly	1
hair	1
instead	1
of	1
seryozha	1
whom	1
in	1
the	1
tangle	1
of	1
her	1
ideas	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
obstinately	1
and	1
violently	1
battering	1
on	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
cork	1
and	1
staring	1
aimlessly	1
at	1
her	1
mother	1
with	1
her	1
pitch	1
black	1
eyes	1
answering	1
the	1
english	1
nurse	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
well	1
and	1
that	1

was	1
going	1

down	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
and	1
began	1
spinning	1
the	1
cork	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
loud	1
ringing	1
laugh	1
and	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
her	1
eyebrows	1
recalled	1
vronsky	1
so	1
vividly	1
that	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
hurriedly	1
restraining	1
her	1
sobs	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
all	1
over	1
no	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
but	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
explain	1
that	1
smile	1
that	1
excitement	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
explain	1
i	1
will	1
believe	1
if	1
i	1
don	1
t	1

only	1
one	1
thing	1

for	1

at	1
her	1
watch	1
twenty	1
minutes	1

passed	1
by	1
now	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
the	1
note	1
and	1
is	1
coming	1
back	1
not	1
long	1
ten	1
minutes	1
more	1
but	1
what	1
if	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1

no	1
that	1

mustn	1
t	1

and	1
wash	1
yes	1
yes	1
did	1
i	1
do	1
my	1
hair	1
or	1
not	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
head	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
yes	1
my	1
hair	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
did	1
it	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
remember	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
pier	1
glass	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
she	1
really	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
hair	1
she	1
certainly	1
had	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
who	1
s	1
that	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
at	1
the	1
swollen	1
face	1
with	1
strangely	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
that	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
way	1
at	1
her	1
why	1
it	1
s	1
i	1
she	1
suddenly	1
understood	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
she	1
seemed	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
feel	1
his	1
kisses	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
twitched	1
her	1
shoulders	1
shuddering	1
then	1
she	1
lifted	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
why	1
i	1
m	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
bedroom	1
where	1
annushka	1
was	1
tidying	1
the	1
room	1
annushka	1
she	1
said	1
coming	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
maid	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
said	1
the	1
girl	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
understood	1

alexandrovna	1
yes	1
i	1

there	1
fifteen	1

ll	1
be	1
here	1
soon	1
she	1
took	1
out	1
her	1
watch	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
he	1
go	1
away	1
leaving	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
live	1
without	1
making	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
me	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
back	1
now	1
but	1
her	1
calculations	1
might	1
be	1
wrong	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
recall	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
started	1
and	1
to	1
count	1
the	1
minutes	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
moved	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
clock	1
to	1
compare	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
watch	1
someone	1
drove	1
up	1
glancing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
carriage	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
came	1
upstairs	1
and	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
below	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
messenger	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
the	1

went	1
down	1
to	1
him	1

she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
rosy	1

mihail	1
as	1
he	1
handed	1
her	1
back	1
her	1
note	1
why	1
then	1
he	1
has	1
never	1

place	1

know	1
and	1

an	1

said	1
to	1
the	1
messenger	1
and	1
i	1
what	1

going	1
to	1

at	1

went	1
to	1

when	1
she	1
was	1
dressed	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
hat	1
she	1
glanced	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
plump	1
comfortable	1
looking	1
annushka	1
there	1
was	1
unmistakable	1

out	1
of	1
this	1

she	1
said	1
feeling	1
with	1
terror	1
the	1
strange	1
turmoil	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
heart	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
get	1
into	1
the	1

it	1
was	1
bright	1
and	1
sunny	1
a	1
fine	1
rain	1
had	1
been	1
falling	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
cleared	1
up	1
the	1
iron	1
roofs	1
the	1
flags	1
of	1
the	1
roads	1
the	1
flints	1
of	1

the	1

of	1
the	1

all	1
glistened	1
brightly	1
in	1
the	1
may	1
sunshine	1
it	1
was	1
three	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
liveliest	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
comfortable	1
carriage	1
that	1
hardly	1
swayed	1
on	1
its	1
supple	1
springs	1
while	1
the	1
grays	1
trotted	1
swiftly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
unceasing	1
rattle	1
of	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
changing	1
impressions	1
in	1
the	1
pure	1
air	1
anna	1
ran	1
over	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
position	1
quite	1
differently	1
from	1
how	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
at	1
home	1
now	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
death	1
seemed	1
no	1
longer	1
so	1
terrible	1
and	1
so	1
clear	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
death	1
itself	1
no	1
longer	1
seemed	1
so	1
inevitable	1
now	1
she	1
blamed	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
humiliation	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
lowered	1
herself	1
i	1
entreat	1
him	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
given	1
in	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
have	1
owned	1
myself	1
in	1

what	1
for	1
can	1
t	1
i	1
live	1
without	1
him	1
and	1
leaving	1
unanswered	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
without	1
him	1
she	1
fell	1
to	1

at	1

and	1
the	1

and	1
she	1
remembered	1
how	1
long	1
long	1
ago	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
seventeen	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
with	1
her	1
aunt	1
to	1
troitsa	1
riding	1
too	1
was	1
that	1
really	1
me	1
with	1
red	1
hands	1
how	1
much	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
then	1
splendid	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
reach	1
has	1
become	1
worthless	1
while	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
then	1
has	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
reach	1
forever	1
could	1
i	1
ever	1
have	1
believed	1
then	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
come	1
to	1
such	1
humiliation	1
how	1
conceited	1
and	1
self	1
satisfied	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
when	1
he	1
gets	1
my	1
note	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
show	1
him	1
how	1
horrid	1
that	1
paint	1
smells	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
they	1
re	1

	1
she	1
read	1
a	1
man	1
bowed	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
annushka	1
s	1
husband	1
our	1
parasites	1
she	1
remembered	1
how	1
vronsky	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
our	1
why	1
our	1
what	1
s	1
so	1
awful	1
is	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
tear	1
up	1
the	1
past	1
by	1
its	1
roots	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
tear	1
it	1
out	1
but	1
one	1
can	1
hide	1
one	1
s	1
memory	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
ll	1
hide	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
past	1
with	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
blotted	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
dolly	1
will	1
think	1
i	1
m	1
leaving	1
my	1
second	1
husband	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
certainly	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
cared	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
cry	1
but	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
fell	1
to	1
wondering	1
what	1
those	1
two	1
girls	1
could	1
be	1
smiling	1
about	1
love	1
most	1
likely	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
dreary	1
it	1
is	1
how	1
low	1
the	1
boulevard	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
three	1
boys	1

anna	1
when	1
she	1

perhaps	1
she	1

s	1
not	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
girl	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
vronsky	1
it	1
s	1
not	1

her	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
i	1
know	1

i	1
can	1
t	1

by	1
any	1

woman	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
i	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
reward	1
oh	1
how	1
i	1
hate	1
him	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
i	1

the	1
sisters	1
voices	1
in	1
consultation	1
and	1
what	1
am	1
i	1

her	1
patronizing	1
no	1
and	1
besides	1
dolly	1
wouldn	1
t	1
understand	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
good	1
my	1
telling	1
her	1
it	1
would	1
only	1
be	1
interesting	1
to	1
see	1
kitty	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
how	1
i	1
despise	1
everyone	1
and	1
everything	1
how	1
nothing	1
matters	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
dolly	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
anna	1
read	1
it	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
back	1
in	1
silence	1
i	1

it	1

oh	1

so	1
on	1
the	1

dolly	1
looking	1
inquisitively	1
at	1
anna	1
she	1

never	1

her	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
strangely	1
irritable	1
condition	1
when	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
away	1
she	1
asked	1
anna	1
half	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
looked	1
straight	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
why	1
does	1
kitty	1
shrink	1
from	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
flushing	1
red	1
oh	1
what	1
nonsense	1
she	1
s	1
nursing	1

she	1
ll	1

here	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
said	1
dolly	1
awkwardly	1
not	1
clever	1
at	1
lying	1
yes	1
here	1
she	1
is	1
hearing	1
that	1
anna	1
had	1
called	1
kitty	1
had	1
wanted	1
not	1
to	1
appear	1
but	1
dolly	1
persuaded	1
her	1
rallying	1
her	1
forces	1
kitty	1
went	1
in	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
blushing	1
and	1
shook	1
hands	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
kitty	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
into	1
confusion	1
by	1
the	1
inward	1
conflict	1
between	1
her	1
antagonism	1
to	1
this	1
bad	1
woman	1
and	1
her	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
nice	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
anna	1

lovely	1
and	1
attractive	1

all	1
feeling	1
of	1
antagonism	1
disappeared	1
i	1
should	1
not	1

said	1
anna	1
kitty	1
felt	1
that	1
anna	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
hostile	1
eyes	1
she	1
ascribed	1
this	1
hostility	1
to	1
the	1
awkward	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
anna	1
who	1
had	1
once	1
patronized	1
her	1
must	1
feel	1
with	1
her	1
now	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
kitty	1
s	1
illness	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
of	1
stiva	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
nothing	1
interested	1
anna	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
you	1
she	1

getting	1
up	1
oh	1
when	1

glad	1
to	1

with	1
a	1

much	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
everyone	1
even	1
from	1
your	1
husband	1
he	1
came	1
to	1

me	1
and	1
i	1
liked	1
him	1
exceedingly	1

unmistakably	1
with	1
malicious	1
intent	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
back	1
to	1
the	1

and	1
just	1
as	1

when	1

anna	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
again	1
in	1
an	1
even	1
worse	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
home	1
to	1
her	1
previous	1
tortures	1
was	1
added	1
now	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
mortification	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
outcast	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
so	1
distinctly	1
on	1
meeting	1
kitty	1
where	1
to	1
home	1
asked	1
pyotr	1
yes	1
home	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
even	1
thinking	1
now	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
how	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
as	1
something	1
dreadful	1
incomprehensible	1
and	1
curious	1
what	1
can	1
he	1
be	1
telling	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
such	1
warmth	1
she	1
thought	1
staring	1
at	1
two	1
men	1
who	1
walked	1
by	1
can	1
one	1
ever	1
tell	1
anyone	1
what	1
one	1
is	1

meant	1
to	1
tell	1
dolly	1
and	1
it	1

i	1
didn	1

tell	1
her	1
how	1

she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
my	1
misery	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
concealed	1
it	1
but	1
her	1
chief	1
feeling	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
delight	1
at	1
my	1
being	1
punished	1
for	1
the	1
happiness	1
she	1
envied	1
me	1
for	1
kitty	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
even	1
more	1
pleased	1
how	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
through	1
her	1
she	1
knows	1
i	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
sweet	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
she	1
s	1
jealous	1

if	1

fall	1
in	1

with	1

if	1
i	1
d	1

there	1
s	1
someone	1
who	1

a	1
fat	1
rubicund	1
gentleman	1
coming	1
towards	1
her	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
for	1
an	1

and	1
lifted	1
his	1
glossy	1
hat	1
above	1
his	1
bald	1
glossy	1

and	1
then	1
perceived	1
his	1

knows	1
me	1

stopping	1
an	1
ice	1
cream	1
seller	1
who	1
took	1
a	1
barrel	1
off	1
his	1

and	1
began	1
wiping	1
his	1
perspiring	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
towel	1
we	1
all	1
want	1
what	1
is	1
sweet	1

the	1

instant	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1

to	1
tell	1
anything	1
amusing	1
to	1
and	1
there	1

nothing	1

mirthful	1
really	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
hateful	1
they	1
re	1
singing	1
for	1

and	1
how	1
carefully	1
that	1
merchant	1
crosses	1
himself	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1

why	1
these	1

and	1
this	1

and	1
this	1
humbug	1
simply	1
to	1
conceal	1
that	1
we	1

angrily	1
yashvin	1
says	1

of	1

the	1
truth	1
she	1
was	1
plunged	1
in	1
these	1
thoughts	1
which	1
so	1
engrossed	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
left	1
off	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
when	1
the	1
carriage	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
her	1
house	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
porter	1
running	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
remembered	1
she	1
had	1

the	1
porter	1
and	1
glancing	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
thin	1
square	1

and	1

a	1
vague	1
fury	1
and	1
craving	1
for	1
revenge	1
rising	1
up	1
within	1
her	1
she	1
ran	1
upstairs	1

him	1
all	1
never	1

i	1
hated	1
anyone	1
as	1
i	1
hate	1
that	1
man	1
she	1
thought	1
seeing	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
the	1
rack	1
she	1
shuddered	1
with	1
aversion	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
that	1
his	1
telegram	1
was	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
telegram	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
received	1
her	1
note	1
she	1
pictured	1
him	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
talking	1
calmly	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
princess	1
sorokina	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
her	1
sufferings	1
yes	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
quickly	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
knowing	1
yet	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
the	1
feelings	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
in	1
that	1
awful	1
house	1
the	1
servants	1
the	1
walls	1
the	1
things	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
all	1
aroused	1
repulsion	1
and	1
hatred	1
in	1
her	1
and	1
lay	1
like	1
a	1
weight	1
upon	1
her	1
yes	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
there	1
then	1
go	1
there	1
and	1
catch	1
him	1
anna	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
railway	1
timetable	1
in	1
the	1
newspapers	1
an	1
evening	1
train	1
went	1
at	1
two	1
minutes	1
past	1
eight	1
yes	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
she	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
packed	1
in	1
a	1
traveling	1
bag	1
the	1
things	1
needed	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
she	1
knew	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
back	1
here	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
plans	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
vaguely	1
determined	1
that	1
after	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
countess	1
s	1
house	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
town	1
on	1
the	1
nizhni	1
road	1
and	1
stop	1
there	1
dinner	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
but	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
feel	1
that	1
all	1
food	1
was	1
disgusting	1
she	1
ordered	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
house	1
threw	1
a	1
shadow	1
now	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
street	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
bright	1
evening	1
and	1
still	1
warm	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
annushka	1
who	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
things	1
and	1
pyotr	1
who	1
put	1
the	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
evidently	1
out	1
of	1
humor	1
were	1
all	1
hateful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
irritated	1
her	1
by	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
actions	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
you	1
pyotr	1
but	1
how	1
about	1
the	1
ticket	1
well	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
matter	1
she	1
said	1
crossly	1
pyotr	1
jumped	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
arms	1
akimbo	1
told	1
the	1
coachman	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
booking	1
office	1
chapter	1
30	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
again	1
again	1
i	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
anna	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
had	1
started	1
and	1
swaying	1
lightly	1
rumbled	1
over	1
the	1
tiny	1
cobbles	1
of	1
the	1
paved	1
road	1
and	1
again	1
one	1
impression	1
followed	1
rapidly	1
upon	1
another	1
yes	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
so	1
clearly	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
recall	1
it	1
tiutkin	1
coiffeur	1
	1
no	1
not	1
that	1
yes	1
of	1
what	1
yashvin	1
says	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
and	1
hatred	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
holds	1
men	1
together	1
no	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
useless	1
journey	1
you	1
re	1
making	1
she	1
said	1
mentally	1
addressing	1
a	1
party	1
in	1
a	1
coach	1
and	1
four	1
evidently	1
going	1
for	1
an	1
excursion	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
the	1
dog	1
you	1
re	1
taking	1
with	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
help	1
to	1
you	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
yourselves	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
pyotr	1
had	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
factory	1
hand	1
almost	1
dead	1
drunk	1
with	1
hanging	1
head	1
being	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
a	1
policeman	1
come	1
he	1
s	1
found	1
a	1
quicker	1
way	1
she	1
thought	1
count	1
vronsky	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
that	1
happiness	1
either	1
though	1
we	1
expected	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
anna	1
turned	1
that	1
glaring	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
seeing	1
everything	1
on	1
to	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
hitherto	1
avoided	1
thinking	1
about	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
he	1
sought	1
in	1
me	1
not	1
love	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
vanity	1
she	1
remembered	1
his	1
words	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
recalled	1
an	1
abject	1
setter	1
dog	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
connection	1
and	1
everything	1
now	1
confirmed	1
this	1
yes	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
triumph	1
of	1
success	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
was	1
love	1
too	1
but	1
the	1
chief	1
element	1
was	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
success	1
he	1
boasted	1
of	1
me	1
now	1
that	1
s	1
over	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
he	1
has	1
taken	1
from	1
me	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
weary	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
is	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
dishonorable	1
in	1
his	1
behavior	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
let	1
that	1
out	1
yesterday	1
he	1
wants	1
divorce	1
and	1
marriage	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
burn	1
his	1
ships	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
but	1
how	1
the	1
zest	1
is	1
gone	1
as	1
the	1
english	1
say	1
that	1
fellow	1
wants	1
everyone	1
to	1
admire	1
him	1
and	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
himself	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
red	1
faced	1
clerk	1
riding	1
on	1
a	1
riding	1
school	1
horse	1
yes	1
there	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
flavor	1
about	1
me	1
for	1
him	1
now	1
if	1
i	1
go	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
mere	1
supposition	1
she	1
saw	1
it	1
distinctly	1
in	1
the	1
piercing	1
light	1
which	1
revealed	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
human	1
relations	1
my	1
love	1
keeps	1
growing	1
more	1
passionate	1
and	1
egoistic	1
while	1
his	1
is	1
waning	1
and	1
waning	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
we	1
re	1
drifting	1
apart	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
musing	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
is	1
everything	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
want	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
give	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
entirely	1
and	1
he	1
wants	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
we	1
walked	1
to	1
meet	1
each	1
other	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
our	1
love	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
irresistibly	1
drifting	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
altering	1
that	1
he	1
tells	1
me	1
i	1
m	1
insanely	1
jealous	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
told	1
myself	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
insanely	1
jealous	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
true	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
jealous	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
unsatisfied	1
but	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
shifted	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
in	1
the	1
excitement	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
her	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
mistress	1
passionately	1
caring	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
caresses	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
and	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
else	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
desire	1
i	1
rouse	1
aversion	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
rouses	1
fury	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
different	1
don	1
t	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
wouldn	1
t	1
deceive	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
schemes	1
about	1
princess	1
sorokina	1
that	1
he	1

that	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
desert	1
me	1
i	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
but	1
it	1
makes	1
it	1
no	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
if	1
without	1
loving	1
me	1
from	1
duty	1
he	1
ll	1
be	1
good	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
me	1
without	1
what	1

a	1
thousand	1
times	1
worse	1
than	1
unkindness	1
that	1

and	1
that	1

just	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
a	1
long	1

now	1
he	1

of	1
alexey	1
alexandrovitch	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
pictured	1
him	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
vividness	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
alive	1
before	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
mild	1
lifeless	1
dull	1
eyes	1
the	1
blue	1
veins	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
hands	1
his	1
intonations	1
and	1
the	1
cracking	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
and	1
remembering	1
the	1
feeling	1
which	1
had	1
existed	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
called	1

and	1
will	1
seryozha	1
leave	1
off	1
asking	1
and	1
wondering	1
about	1
my	1

not	1
happiness	1

sort	1
of	1
ease	1
from	1
misery	1

no	1
she	1
answered	1
now	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
hesitation	1
impossible	1
we	1
are	1
drawn	1
apart	1
by	1
life	1
and	1

into	1
the	1

to	1
hate	1
each	1

and	1
so	1
to	1
torture	1
ourselves	1
and	1
each	1
other	1
schoolboys	1
coming	1
laughing	1
seryozha	1
she	1
thought	1
i	1
thought	1
too	1
that	1
i	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
touched	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
tenderness	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
lived	1
without	1
him	1
i	1
gave	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
another	1
love	1

did	1
not	1
regret	1
the	1
exchange	1
till	1
that	1
love	1
was	1
satisfied	1
and	1
with	1
loathing	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
by	1
that	1
love	1
and	1
the	1
clearness	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
saw	1
life	1
now	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
s	1
was	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
pyotr	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
fyodor	1
and	1
that	1
merchant	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
living	1
along	1
the	1
volga	1
where	1
those	1
placards	1
invite	1
one	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
everywhere	1
and	1
always	1
she	1
thought	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
driven	1
under	1
the	1
low	1
pitched	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
nizhigorod	1
station	1
and	1
the	1
porters	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
a	1
ticket	1
to	1
obiralovka	1
said	1
pyotr	1
she	1
had	1
utterly	1
forgotten	1
where	1
and	1
why	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
she	1
understood	1
the	1
question	1
yes	1
she	1
said	1
handing	1
him	1
her	1
purse	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
little	1
red	1
bag	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
she	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
making	1
her	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
waiting	1
room	1
she	1
gradually	1
recollected	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
the	1
plans	1
between	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
hesitating	1
and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
sore	1
places	1
hope	1
and	1
then	1
despair	1
poisoned	1
the	1
wounds	1
of	1
her	1
tortured	1
fearfully	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
star	1
shaped	1
sofa	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1

stepped	1
up	1

at	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

a	1

down	1
the	1

themselves	1
on	1
the	1

and	1
intently	1
but	1
surreptitiously	1
scrutinized	1
her	1

seemed	1
repulsive	1
to	1

the	1

him	1
to	1

one	1

entirely	1
for	1

clearly	1
that	1

were	1
sick	1
of	1
each	1

to	1

that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
anyone	1
to	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
that	1
this	1

irritated	1
her	1
agonizingly	1
and	1
she	1
would	1

up	1

the	1

in	1
her	1

would	1
be	1

out	1

at	1
the	1

whirling	1
by	1
as	1
they	1
ran	1
beside	1
the	1

stood	1
on	1
the	1

to	1
the	1

swaying	1
of	1

she	1
fell	1
to	1
thinking	1
again	1
as	1

breathed	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
yes	1
what	1
did	1
i	1
stop	1
at	1
that	1
i	1
couldn	1
t	1
conceive	1
a	1
position	1
in	1

a	1
misery	1
that	1
we	1

miserable	1

that	1
we	1

when	1

the	1

what	1
is	1

s	1
what	1

is	1

for	1
to	1

in	1
french	1
lisping	1
affectedly	1
and	1
obviously	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
phrase	1
the	1

an	1
answer	1
to	1
anna	1
s	1

to	1
escape	1
from	1
what	1

him	1
repeated	1
anna	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
red	1
cheeked	1
husband	1
and	1
the	1
thin	1
wife	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
sickly	1
wife	1
considered	1
herself	1
misunderstood	1
and	1
the	1
husband	1
deceived	1
her	1
and	1
encouraged	1
her	1
in	1
that	1
idea	1
of	1
herself	1
anna	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
their	1
history	1

all	1
the	1
crannies	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
as	1

turning	1

there	1
was	1
nothing	1

in	1

and	1
she	1
pursued	1
her	1
thought	1
yes	1
i	1
m	1
very	1
much	1
worried	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
what	1

for	1

out	1
the	1

there	1
s	1
nothing	1

at	1
when	1
it	1

to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
all	1

how	1
why	1
did	1
the	1
conductor	1
run	1
along	1
the	1

why	1
are	1
they	1
shrieking	1
those	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
that	1

when	1

got	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
passengers	1
and	1
moving	1
apart	1
from	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
lepers	1
she	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
trying	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
here	1
for	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
possible	1
before	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
difficult	1
to	1
consider	1
especially	1
in	1
this	1
noisy	1
crowd	1
of	1
hideous	1
people	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
alone	1
one	1
moment	1
porters	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
proffering	1
their	1
services	1
then	1
young	1
men	1
clacking	1
their	1
heels	1
on	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
talking	1
loudly	1
stared	1
at	1
her	1
people	1
meeting	1
her	1
dodged	1
past	1
on	1
the	1
wrong	1
side	1
remembering	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
further	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
answer	1
she	1
stopped	1
a	1
porter	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
her	1
coachman	1
were	1
not	1
here	1
with	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
count	1
vronsky	1
count	1
vronsky	1
they	1
sent	1
up	1
here	1
from	1
the	1
vronskys	1
just	1
this	1
minute	1
to	1
meet	1
princess	1
sorokina	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
coachman	1
like	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
porter	1
the	1
coachman	1
mihail	1
red	1
and	1
cheerful	1
in	1
his	1
smart	1
blue	1
coat	1
and	1
chain	1
evidently	1
proud	1
of	1
having	1
so	1
successfully	1
performed	1
his	1
commission	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
letter	1
she	1
broke	1
it	1
open	1
and	1
her	1
heart	1
ached	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
read	1
it	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
your	1
note	1
did	1
not	1
reach	1
me	1
i	1
will	1
be	1
home	1
at	1
ten	1
vronsky	1
had	1
written	1
carelessly	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
i	1
expected	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
evil	1
smile	1
very	1
good	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
home	1
then	1
she	1
said	1
softly	1
addressing	1
mihail	1
she	1
spoke	1
softly	1
because	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
s	1
beating	1
hindered	1
her	1
breathing	1
no	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
let	1
you	1
make	1
me	1
miserable	1
she	1
thought	1
menacingly	1
addressing	1
not	1
him	1
not	1
herself	1
but	1
the	1
power	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
suffer	1
and	1
she	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
platform	1
two	1
maid	1
servants	1
walking	1
along	1
the	1
platform	1
turned	1
their	1
heads	1
staring	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
making	1
some	1
remarks	1
about	1
her	1
dress	1
real	1
they	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
lace	1
she	1
was	1
wearing	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
in	1
peace	1
again	1
they	1
passed	1
by	1
peering	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
shouting	1
something	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
voice	1
the	1
station	1
master	1
coming	1
up	1
asked	1
her	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
by	1
train	1
a	1
boy	1
selling	1
kvas	1
never	1
took	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
my	1
god	1
where	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
go	1
she	1
thought	1
going	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
along	1
the	1
platform	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
she	1
stopped	1
some	1
ladies	1
and	1
children	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
spectacles	1
paused	1
in	1
their	1
loud	1
laughter	1
and	1
talking	1
and	1
stared	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
reached	1
them	1
she	1
quickened	1
her	1
pace	1
and	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
platform	1
a	1
luggage	1
train	1
was	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
platform	1
began	1
to	1
sway	1
and	1
she	1
fancied	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
again	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
crushed	1
by	1
the	1
train	1
the	1
day	1
she	1
had	1
first	1
met	1
vronsky	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
light	1
step	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
that	1
led	1
from	1
the	1
tank	1
to	1
the	1
rails	1
and	1
stopped	1
quite	1
near	1
the	1
approaching	1
train	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
at	1
the	1
screws	1
and	1
chains	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
cast	1
iron	1
wheel	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
carriage	1
slowly	1
moving	1
up	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
measure	1
the	1
middle	1
between	1
the	1
front	1
and	1
back	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
minute	1
when	1
that	1
middle	1
point	1
would	1
be	1
opposite	1
her	1
there	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
at	1
the	1
sand	1
and	1
coal	1
dust	1
which	1
covered	1
the	1
sleepers	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
middle	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
punish	1
him	1
and	1
escape	1
from	1
everyone	1
and	1
from	1
myself	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
fling	1
herself	1
below	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
carriage	1
as	1
it	1
reached	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
red	1
bag	1
which	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
drop	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
delayed	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
she	1
missed	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
had	1
to	1

she	1
had	1
known	1
when	1
about	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
first	1
plunge	1
in	1
bathing	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
crossed	1
herself	1
that	1
familiar	1
gesture	1
brought	1
back	1
into	1
her	1
soul	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
girlish	1
and	1
childish	1
memories	1
and	1
suddenly	1
the	1
darkness	1
that	1
had	1
covered	1
everything	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
torn	1
apart	1

life	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
her	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
bright	1
past	1

she	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
carriage	1
and	1
exactly	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
wheels	1
came	1
opposite	1
her	1
she	1
dropped	1
the	1
red	1
bag	1
and	1
drawing	1
her	1
head	1
back	1
into	1
her	1
shoulders	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
hands	1
under	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
lightly	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
rise	1
again	1
at	1
once	1
dropped	1
on	1
to	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
at	1
the	1

instant	1

was	1
terror	1

something	1
huge	1

struck	1
her	1
on	1

only	1
just	1
preparing	1

sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
life	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
uneventful	1
during	1
this	1
time	1
a	1

he	1

six	1

of	1

sections	1
of	1
this	1

and	1
its	1
introduction	1
had	1
appeared	1
in	1
periodical	1
publications	1
and	1
other	1
parts	1
had	1
been	1
read	1
by	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
to	1
persons	1
of	1
his	1
circle	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
leading	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
completely	1
novel	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
but	1
still	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
had	1
expected	1
that	1
on	1
its	1
appearance	1
his	1
book	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
serious	1
impression	1
on	1
society	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
social	1
science	1
it	1
would	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
scientific	1
world	1
after	1
the	1
most	1
conscientious	1
revision	1
the	1
book	1
had	1
last	1
year	1
been	1
published	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
distributed	1
among	1
the	1
booksellers	1
though	1
he	1
asked	1
no	1
one	1
about	1
it	1
reluctantly	1
and	1
with	1
feigned	1
indifference	1
answered	1
his	1
friends	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
booksellers	1
how	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
selling	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
alert	1
with	1
strained	1
attention	1
watching	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
impression	1
his	1
book	1
would	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
in	1
literature	1
but	1
a	1
week	1
passed	1
a	1
second	1
a	1
third	1
and	1
in	1
society	1
no	1
impression	1
whatever	1
could	1
be	1
detected	1
his	1
friends	1
who	1
were	1
specialists	1
and	1
savants	1
occasionally	1
unmistakably	1
from	1
politeness	1
alluded	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
a	1
book	1
on	1
a	1
learned	1
subject	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
society	1
generally	1
just	1
now	1
especially	1
absorbed	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
was	1
absolutely	1
indifferent	1
in	1
the	1
press	1
too	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
his	1
book	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
had	1
calculated	1
to	1
a	1
nicety	1
the	1
time	1
necessary	1
for	1
writing	1
a	1
review	1
but	1
a	1
month	1
passed	1
and	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
still	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
northern	1
beetle	1
in	1
a	1
comic	1
article	1
on	1
the	1
singer	1
drabanti	1
who	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
voice	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
allusion	1
to	1
koznishev	1
s	1
book	1
suggesting	1
that	1
the	1
book	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
ago	1
seen	1
through	1
by	1
everyone	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
general	1
ridicule	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
month	1
a	1
critical	1
article	1
appeared	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
review	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
knew	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
article	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
once	1
at	1
golubtsov	1
s	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
article	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
an	1
invalid	1
very	1
bold	1
as	1
a	1
writer	1
but	1
extremely	1
deficient	1
in	1
breeding	1
and	1
shy	1
in	1
personal	1
relations	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
absolute	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
author	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
complete	1
respect	1
that	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
set	1
about	1
reading	1
the	1
article	1
the	1
article	1
was	1
awful	1
the	1
critic	1
had	1
undoubtedly	1
put	1
an	1
interpretation	1
upon	1
the	1
book	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
be	1
put	1
on	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
selected	1
quotations	1
so	1
adroitly	1
that	1
for	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
obviously	1
scarcely	1
anyone	1
had	1
read	1
it	1
it	1
seemed	1
absolutely	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
book	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
medley	1
of	1
high	1
flown	1
phrases	1
not	1
even	1
as	1
suggested	1
by	1
marks	1
of	1
interrogation	1
used	1
appropriately	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
absolutely	1
without	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
so	1
wittily	1
done	1
that	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
disowned	1
such	1
wit	1
himself	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
so	1
awful	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
scrupulous	1
conscientiousness	1
with	1
which	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
verified	1
the	1
correctness	1
of	1
the	1
critic	1
s	1
arguments	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
stop	1
to	1
ponder	1
over	1
the	1
faults	1
and	1
mistakes	1
which	1
were	1
ridiculed	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
he	1
began	1
immediately	1
trying	1
to	1
recall	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
meeting	1
and	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
article	1
didn	1
t	1
i	1
offend	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
wondered	1
and	1
remembering	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
he	1
had	1
corrected	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
about	1
something	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
betrayed	1
ignorance	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
found	1
the	1
clue	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
article	1
this	1
article	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
deadly	1
silence	1
about	1
the	1
book	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
press	1
and	1
in	1
conversation	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
six	1
years	1
task	1
toiled	1
at	1
with	1
such	1
love	1
and	1
labor	1
had	1
gone	1
leaving	1
no	1
trace	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
position	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
difficult	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
book	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
literary	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
such	1
as	1
had	1
hitherto	1
occupied	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
clever	1
cultivated	1
healthy	1
and	1
energetic	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
use	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
his	1
energy	1
conversations	1
in	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
in	1
meetings	1
assemblies	1
and	1
committees	1
everywhere	1
where	1
talk	1
was	1
possible	1
took	1
up	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
but	1
being	1
used	1
for	1
years	1
to	1
town	1
life	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
waste	1
all	1
his	1
energies	1
in	1
talk	1
as	1
his	1
less	1
experienced	1
younger	1
brother	1
did	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
moscow	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
leisure	1
and	1
intellectual	1
energy	1
still	1
to	1
dispose	1
of	1
fortunately	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
so	1
difficult	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
failure	1
of	1
his	1
book	1
the	1
various	1
public	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
dissenting	1
sects	1
of	1
the	1
american	1
alliance	1
of	1
the	1
samara	1
famine	1
of	1
exhibitions	1
and	1
of	1
spiritualism	1
were	1
definitely	1
replaced	1
in	1
public	1
interest	1
by	1
the	1
slavonic	1
question	1
which	1
had	1
hitherto	1
rather	1
languidly	1
interested	1
society	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
raise	1
this	1
subject	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
it	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
circle	1
to	1
which	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
belonged	1
nothing	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
or	1
written	1
about	1
just	1
now	1
but	1
the	1
servian	1
war	1
everything	1
that	1
the	1
idle	1
crowd	1
usually	1
does	1
to	1
kill	1
time	1
was	1
done	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
slavonic	1
states	1
balls	1
concerts	1
dinners	1
matchboxes	1
ladies	1
dresses	1
beer	1
restaurants	1
everything	1
testified	1
to	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
slavonic	1
peoples	1
from	1
much	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
spoken	1
and	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
differed	1
on	1
various	1
points	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
slavonic	1
question	1
had	1
become	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
fashionable	1
distractions	1
which	1
succeed	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
providing	1
society	1
with	1
an	1
object	1
and	1
an	1
occupation	1
he	1
saw	1
too	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
people	1
were	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
subject	1
from	1
motives	1
of	1
self	1
interest	1
and	1
self	1
advertisement	1
he	1
recognized	1
that	1
the	1
newspapers	1
published	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
that	1
was	1
superfluous	1
and	1
exaggerated	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
aim	1
of	1
attracting	1
attention	1
and	1
outbidding	1
one	1
another	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
general	1
movement	1
those	1
who	1
thrust	1
themselves	1
most	1
forward	1
and	1
shouted	1
the	1
loudest	1
were	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
failed	1
and	1
were	1
smarting	1
under	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
injury	1
generals	1
without	1
armies	1
ministers	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
ministry	1
journalists	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
paper	1
party	1
leaders	1
without	1
followers	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
was	1
frivolous	1
and	1
absurd	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
recognized	1
an	1
unmistakable	1
growing	1
enthusiasm	1
uniting	1
all	1
classes	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
sympathize	1
the	1
massacre	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
fellow	1
christians	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
slavonic	1
race	1
excited	1
sympathy	1
for	1
the	1
sufferers	1
and	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
oppressors	1
and	1
the	1
heroism	1
of	1
the	1
servians	1
and	1
montenegrins	1
struggling	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
cause	1
begot	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
people	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
help	1
their	1
brothers	1
not	1
in	1
word	1
but	1
in	1
deed	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
aspect	1
that	1
rejoiced	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
public	1
opinion	1
the	1
public	1
had	1
definitely	1
expressed	1
its	1
desire	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
as	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
said	1
found	1
expression	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
worked	1
in	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
more	1
incontestable	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cause	1
destined	1
to	1
assume	1
vast	1
dimensions	1
to	1
create	1
an	1
epoch	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
into	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
cause	1
and	1
forgot	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
his	1
book	1
his	1
whole	1
time	1
now	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
scarcely	1
manage	1
to	1
answer	1
all	1
the	1
letters	1
and	1
appeals	1
addressed	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
worked	1
the	1
whole	1
spring	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
july	1
that	1
he	1
prepared	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
both	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
farthest	1
wilds	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
uplifting	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
people	1

a	1
fresh	1

carrying	1
the	1
princess	1
off	1
her	1

for	1

eh	1

he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
the	1
princess	1
looked	1
at	1
koznishev	1
without	1
replying	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
seemed	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
disconcert	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
he	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
feather	1
in	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
hat	1
and	1
then	1
about	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
pick	1
something	1
up	1
seeing	1
a	1
lady	1
approaching	1
with	1
a	1
collecting	1
box	1
he	1
beckoned	1
her	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
five	1
rouble	1
note	1
i	1
can	1
never	1
see	1
these	1
collecting	1
boxes	1
unmoved	1
while	1

how	1
about	1

s	1
telegram	1
fine	1
chaps	1
those	1
montenegrins	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
so	1
he	1
cried	1
when	1
the	1
princess	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
vronsky	1
was	1
going	1
by	1
this	1
train	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
s	1
face	1
looked	1
sad	1
but	1
a	1
minute	1
later	1
when	1
stroking	1
his	1
mustaches	1
and	1
swinging	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
vronsky	1
was	1
he	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
his	1
own	1
despairing	1
sobs	1
over	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
corpse	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
vronsky	1
only	1
a	1
hero	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
faults	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
refuse	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
justice	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
to	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
had	1
left	1
them	1
what	1
a	1
typically	1
russian	1
slav	1
nature	1
only	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1

won	1
t	1
be	1
pleasant	1
for	1
vronsky	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
i	1
m	1
touched	1
by	1
that	1
man	1
s	1
fate	1
do	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
yes	1
perhaps	1
if	1
it	1
happens	1
so	1
i	1
never	1
liked	1
him	1
but	1
this	1
atones	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
merely	1
going	1
himself	1
he	1
s	1
taking	1
a	1
squadron	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
expense	1
yes	1
so	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
bell	1
sounded	1
everyone	1
crowded	1
to	1
the	1
doors	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
indicating	1
vronsky	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
walked	1
by	1
wearing	1
a	1
long	1
overcoat	1
and	1
wide	1
brimmed	1
black	1
hat	1
oblonsky	1
was	1
walking	1
beside	1
him	1
talking	1
eagerly	1
of	1
something	1
vronsky	1
was	1
frowning	1
and	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
what	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
was	1
saying	1
probably	1
on	1
oblonsky	1
s	1
pointing	1
them	1
out	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
where	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
were	1
standing	1
and	1
without	1
speaking	1
lifted	1
his	1
hat	1
his	1
face	1
aged	1
and	1
worn	1
by	1
suffering	1
looked	1
stony	1
going	1
onto	1
the	1
platform	1
vronsky	1
left	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
disappeared	1
into	1
a	1
compartment	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
there	1
rang	1
out	1
god	1
save	1
the	1
tsar	1
then	1
shouts	1
of	1
hurrah	1
and	1
	1
jivio	1
	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
volunteers	1
a	1
tall	1
very	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
hollow	1
chest	1
was	1
particularly	1
conspicuous	1
bowing	1
and	1
waving	1
his	1
felt	1
hat	1
and	1
a	1
nosegay	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
then	1
two	1
officers	1
emerged	1
bowing	1
too	1
and	1
a	1
stout	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
beard	1
wearing	1
a	1
greasy	1
forage	1

chapter	1

saying	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
was	1
joined	1
by	1
katavasov	1
together	1
they	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
carriage	1
full	1
to	1
overflowing	1
and	1
the	1
train	1
started	1
at	1
tsaritsino	1
station	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
chorus	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
singing	1
hail	1
to	1
thee	1
again	1
the	1
volunteers	1
bowed	1
and	1
poked	1
their	1
heads	1
out	1
but	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
them	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
volunteers	1
that	1
the	1
type	1
was	1
familiar	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him	1
katavasov	1
whose	1
scientific	1
work	1
had	1
prevented	1
his	1
having	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
observing	1
them	1
hitherto	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
questioned	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
class	1
and	1
talk	1
to	1
them	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
station	1
katavasov	1
acted	1
on	1
this	1
suggestion	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
stop	1
he	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
class	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
volunteers	1
they	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
obviously	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
passengers	1
and	1
katavasov	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
in	1
was	1
concentrated	1
upon	1
them	1
more	1
loudly	1
than	1
all	1
talked	1
the	1
tall	1
hollow	1
chested	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
tipsy	1
and	1
was	1
relating	1
some	1
story	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
at	1
his	1
school	1
facing	1
him	1
sat	1
a	1
middle	1
aged	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
austrian	1
military	1
jacket	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
uniform	1
he	1
was	1
listening	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
the	1
hollow	1
chested	1
youth	1
and	1
occasionally	1
pulling	1
him	1
up	1
the	1
third	1
in	1
an	1
artillery	1
uniform	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
box	1
beside	1
them	1
a	1
fourth	1
was	1
asleep	1
entering	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
youth	1
katavasov	1
learned	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
wealthy	1
moscow	1
merchant	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
through	1
a	1
large	1
fortune	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
two	1
and	1
twenty	1
katavasov	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
unmanly	1
and	1
effeminate	1
and	1
sickly	1
he	1
was	1
obviously	1
convinced	1
especially	1
now	1
after	1
drinking	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
performing	1
a	1
heroic	1
action	1
and	1
he	1
bragged	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
way	1
the	1
second	1
the	1
retired	1
officer	1
made	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
too	1
upon	1
katavasov	1
he	1
was	1
it	1
seemed	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
tried	1
everything	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
a	1
railway	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
land	1
steward	1

had	1

factories	1
and	1
he	1
talked	1
quite	1
without	1
necessity	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
used	1
learned	1
expressions	1
quite	1
inappropriately	1
the	1
third	1
the	1
artilleryman	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
struck	1
katavasov	1
very	1
favorably	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
quiet	1
modest	1
fellow	1
unmistakably	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
the	1
heroic	1
self	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
merchant	1
and	1
saying	1
nothing	1
about	1
himself	1
when	1
katavasov	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
had	1
impelled	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
servia	1
he	1
answered	1
modestly	1
oh	1
well	1
everyone	1
s	1
going	1
the	1
servians	1

too	1
i	1

yes	1
you	1
artillerymen	1

katavasov	1
oh	1
i	1
wasn	1

maybe	1
they	1
ll	1
put	1
me	1
into	1

or	1
the	1
cavalry	1
into	1
the	1
infantry	1
when	1
they	1
need	1
artillery	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1

from	1
the	1
artilleryman	1

age	1
that	1
he	1
must	1

cadet	1
retired	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
failed	1
in	1
his	1
examination	1
all	1
of	1
this	1
together	1
made	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
on	1
katavasov	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
volunteers	1
got	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
station	1
for	1
a	1
drink	1
katavasov	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
compare	1
his	1
unfavorable	1
impression	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
someone	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
wearing	1
a	1
military	1
overcoat	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
to	1
katavasov	1
s	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
volunteers	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
katavasov	1
addressed	1
him	1
what	1
different	1
positions	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
all	1
those	1
fellows	1
who	1
are	1
going	1
off	1
there	1
katavasov	1
said	1
vaguely	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
own	1
opinion	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
anxious	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
views	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
served	1
on	1
two	1
campaigns	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
makes	1
a	1
soldier	1
and	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
and	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
those	1
persons	1
by	1
the	1
swagger	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
bottle	1
on	1
the	1
journey	1
he	1
considered	1
them	1
poor	1
soldiers	1
moreover	1
he	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
district	1
town	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
tell	1
how	1
one	1
soldier	1
had	1
volunteered	1
from	1
his	1
town	1
a	1
drunkard	1
and	1
a	1
thief	1
whom	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
employ	1
as	1
a	1
laborer	1
but	1
knowing	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
temper	1
it	1
was	1
dangerous	1
to	1
express	1
an	1
opinion	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
one	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
criticize	1
the	1
volunteers	1
unfavorably	1
he	1
too	1
watched	1
katavasov	1
without	1
committing	1
himself	1
well	1
men	1
are	1
wanted	1
there	1
he	1
said	1
laughing	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
war	1
news	1
and	1
each	1
concealed	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
his	1
perplexity	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
engagement	1
expected	1
next	1
day	1
since	1
the	1
turks	1
had	1
been	1
beaten	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
latest	1
news	1
at	1
all	1
points	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
parted	1
neither	1
giving	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
opinion	1
katavasov	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
carriage	1
and	1
with	1
reluctant	1
hypocrisy	1
reported	1
to	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
his	1
observations	1
of	1
the	1
volunteers	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
appear	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
capital	1
fellows	1
at	1
a	1
big	1
station	1
at	1
a	1
town	1
the	1
volunteers	1
were	1
again	1
greeted	1
with	1
shouts	1
and	1
singing	1
again	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
with	1
collecting	1
boxes	1
appeared	1
and	1
provincial	1
ladies	1
brought	1
bouquets	1
to	1
the	1
volunteers	1
and	1
followed	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
refreshment	1
room	1
but	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
much	1
smaller	1
and	1
feebler	1
scale	1
than	1
in	1
moscow	1
chapter	1

while	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
stopping	1
at	1
the	1
provincial	1

sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
refreshment	1

but	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
platform	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
passed	1
vronsky	1
s	1
compartment	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
curtain	1
was	1
drawn	1
over	1
the	1
window	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
it	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
beckoned	1
to	1
koznishev	1
i	1
m	1
going	1
you	1
see	1
taking	1
him	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
kursk	1
she	1
said	1
yes	1
so	1
i	1
heard	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
standing	1
at	1
her	1
window	1
and	1
peeping	1
in	1
what	1
a	1
noble	1
act	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
he	1
added	1
noticing	1
that	1
vronsky	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
compartment	1
yes	1
after	1
his	1
misfortune	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
ah	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
through	1
but	1
do	1
get	1
in	1
ah	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
through	1
she	1
repeated	1
when	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
had	1
got	1
in	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
conceive	1
it	1
for	1
six	1
weeks	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
touch	1
food	1
except	1
when	1
i	1
implored	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
one	1
minute	1
could	1
we	1
leave	1
him	1
alone	1
we	1
took	1
away	1
everything	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
used	1
against	1
himself	1
we	1
lived	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reckoning	1
on	1
anything	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shot	1
himself	1
once	1
already	1
on	1
her	1
account	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
s	1
eyelashes	1
twitched	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
yes	1
hers	1
was	1
the	1
fitting	1
end	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
even	1
the	1
death	1
she	1
chose	1
was	1
low	1
and	1
vulgar	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
judge	1
countess	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
hard	1
for	1
you	1
ah	1
don	1
t	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
was	1
staying	1
on	1
my	1
estate	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
note	1
was	1
brought	1
him	1
he	1
wrote	1
an	1
answer	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
off	1
we	1
hadn	1
t	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
close	1
by	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
i	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
gone	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
when	1
my	1
mary	1
told	1
me	1
a	1
lady	1
had	1
thrown	1
herself	1
under	1
the	1
train	1
something	1
seemed	1
to	1
strike	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
i	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
i	1
said	1
was	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
but	1
they	1
d	1
told	1
him	1
already	1
his	1
coachman	1
was	1
there	1
and	1
saw	1
it	1
all	1
when	1
i	1
ran	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
beside	1
himself	1
it	1
was	1
fearful	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
but	1
galloped	1
off	1
there	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
what	1
happened	1
there	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
back	1
at	1
death	1
s	1
door	1
i	1
shouldn	1
t	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
prostration	1
complète	1
	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
followed	1
almost	1
by	1
madness	1
oh	1
why	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
awful	1
time	1
no	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
woman	1
why	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
such	1
desperate	1
passions	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
to	1
show	1
herself	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
well	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
do	1
she	1
brought	1
herself	1
to	1
ruin	1
and	1
two	1
good	1
men	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
my	1
unhappy	1
son	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
her	1
husband	1
do	1
asked	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
he	1
has	1
taken	1
her	1
daughter	1
alexey	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
anything	1
at	1
first	1
now	1
it	1
worries	1
him	1
terribly	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
his	1
own	1
child	1
away	1
to	1
another	1

he	1
can	1
t	1
take	1
back	1
his	1

came	1
to	1
the	1
funeral	1
but	1
we	1
tried	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
meeting	1
alexey	1
for	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
it	1
was	1
easier	1
anyway	1
she	1
had	1
set	1
him	1
free	1
but	1
my	1
poor	1
son	1
was	1
utterly	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
up	1
everything	1
his	1
career	1
me	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
mercy	1
on	1
him	1
but	1
of	1
set	1
purpose	1
she	1
made	1
his	1
ruin	1
complete	1
no	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
her	1
very	1
death	1
was	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
vile	1
woman	1
of	1
no	1

forgive	1
me	1

at	1
my	1

cast	1
by	1

up	1
on	1

with	1

in	1
a	1

turning	1
sharply	1
after	1
twenty	1
paces	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
fancied	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
him	1
that	1
vronsky	1
saw	1
him	1
but	1
was	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
affect	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
he	1
was	1
above	1
all	1
personal	1
considerations	1
with	1
vronsky	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
looked	1
upon	1
vronsky	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
taking	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
cause	1
and	1
koznishev	1
thought	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
encourage	1
him	1
and	1
express	1
his	1
approval	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
vronsky	1
stood	1
still	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
going	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
very	1
warmly	1
possibly	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
me	1

couldn	1

i	1
should	1
less	1

excuse	1
me	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
in	1

for	1
me	1
to	1
like	1

the	1

ache	1
in	1
his	1
strong	1
teeth	1
that	1
were	1
like	1
rows	1
of	1
ivory	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
tender	1
slowly	1
and	1
smoothly	1
rolling	1
along	1
the	1
rails	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
different	1
pain	1
not	1
an	1
ache	1
but	1
an	1
inner	1
trouble	1
that	1
set	1
his	1
whole	1
being	1
in	1
anguish	1
made	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
forget	1
his	1
toothache	1
as	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
tender	1
and	1
the	1
rails	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
a	1
friend	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
met	1
since	1
his	1
misfortune	1
he	1
suddenly	1
recalled	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
her	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
run	1
like	1
one	1
distraught	1
into	1
the	1
cloak	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
shamelessly	1
sprawling	1
out	1
among	1
strangers	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
body	1
so	1
lately	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
the	1
head	1
unhurt	1
dropping	1
back	1
with	1
its	1
weight	1
of	1
hair	1
and	1
the	1
curling	1
tresses	1
about	1
the	1
temples	1
and	1
the	1
exquisite	1
face	1
with	1
red	1
half	1
opened	1
mouth	1
the	1
strange	1
fixed	1
expression	1
piteous	1
on	1
the	1
lips	1
and	1
awful	1
in	1
the	1
still	1
open	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
utter	1
that	1
fearful	1
phrase	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
quarreling	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
her	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
at	1
a	1
railway	1
station	1
too	1
mysterious	1
exquisite	1
loving	1
seeking	1
and	1
giving	1
happiness	1
and	1
not	1
cruelly	1
revengeful	1
as	1
he	1
remembered	1
her	1
on	1
that	1
last	1
moment	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
recall	1
his	1
best	1
moments	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
those	1
moments	1
were	1
poisoned	1
forever	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
triumphant	1
successful	1
in	1
her	1
menace	1
of	1
a	1
wholly	1
useless	1
remorse	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
effaced	1
he	1
lost	1
all	1
consciousness	1
of	1
toothache	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
worked	1
with	1
sobs	1
passing	1
twice	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
baggage	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
regaining	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1
he	1
addressed	1

calmly	1

was	1
not	1

guess	1

connection	1

close	1
that	1

could	1
gauge	1
by	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
her	1
milk	1
his	1

of	1

before	1

indeed	1
crying	1

him	1

her	1
words	1
her	1
impatience	1
kept	1
growing	1
like	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
their	1
impatience	1
hindered	1
things	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
baby	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
breast	1
right	1
and	1
was	1
furious	1
at	1
last	1
after	1
despairing	1
breathless	1
screaming	1

vain	1
sucking	1
things	1
went	1

mother	1

simultaneously	1
soothed	1

all	1

in	1
a	1
whisper	1
touching	1
the	1
baby	1
what	1
makes	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
knows	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
sidelong	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
eyes	1
that	1
peered	1
roguishly	1
as	1
she	1
fancied	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
cap	1
at	1
his	1
rhythmically	1
puffing	1
cheeks	1

statement	1

though	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1

that	1
he	1
knew	1

understood	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1

that	1

a	1
bumblebee	1
struggling	1
on	1
the	1

sat	1
down	1
waving	1
a	1
faded	1
branch	1
of	1
birch	1
over	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1

answered	1
rocking	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
tenderly	1
squeezing	1
the	1
plump	1
little	1
arm	1
with	1
rolls	1
of	1
fat	1
at	1
the	1
wrist	1
which	1
mitya	1
still	1
waved	1
feebly	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
and	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
hand	1
worried	1
kitty	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
but	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
waking	1
the	1
baby	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
ceased	1
waving	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
closed	1
only	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
sucking	1
the	1
baby	1
raised	1
his	1
long	1
curly	1
eyelashes	1
and	1
peeped	1
at	1
his	1
mother	1
with	1
wet	1
eyes	1
that	1
looked	1
black	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
the	1
nurse	1
had	1
left	1
off	1
fanning	1
and	1
was	1
dozing	1
from	1
above	1
came	1
the	1
peals	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
s	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
chuckle	1
of	1
katavasov	1
they	1
have	1
got	1
into	1
talk	1
without	1
me	1

still	1

the	1

it	1

there	1

i	1

it	1
distracts	1
his	1

he	1
s	1
become	1
altogether	1
happier	1
and	1
better	1
now	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
gloomy	1
and	1
worried	1
that	1
i	1
felt	1
frightened	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
how	1
absurd	1
he	1
is	1
she	1
whispered	1
smiling	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
worried	1
her	1
husband	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
unbelief	1
although	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
whether	1
she	1
supposed	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
life	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
damned	1

would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
damned	1
his	1
unbelief	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
her	1
unhappiness	1
and	1
she	1
confessing	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
salvation	1
and	1
loving	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
soul	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
his	1
unbelief	1
and	1
told	1
herself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
absurd	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
keep	1
reading	1
philosophy	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
year	1
she	1
wondered	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
written	1
in	1
those	1
books	1
he	1
can	1
understand	1
them	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
wrong	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
read	1
them	1
he	1
says	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
believe	1
then	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
believe	1
surely	1
from	1
his	1
thinking	1
so	1
much	1
and	1
he	1
thinks	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
being	1
solitary	1
he	1
s	1
always	1
alone	1
alone	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
us	1
i	1
fancy	1
he	1
ll	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
these	1
visitors	1
especially	1
katavasov	1
he	1
likes	1
discussions	1
with	1
them	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
passed	1
instantly	1
to	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
where	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
convenient	1
to	1
put	1
katavasov	1
to	1
sleep	1
alone	1
or	1
to	1
share	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
room	1
and	1
then	1
an	1
idea	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
her	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
shudder	1
and	1
even	1
disturb	1
mitya	1
who	1
glanced	1
severely	1
at	1
her	1
i	1
do	1
believe	1
the	1
laundress	1
hasn	1
t	1
sent	1
the	1
washing	1
yet	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
sheets	1
are	1
in	1
use	1
if	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
to	1
it	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
will	1
give	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
the	1
wrong	1
sheets	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
idea	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
kitty	1
s	1
face	1
yes	1
i	1
will	1
arrange	1
it	1
she	1
decided	1
and	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
former	1
thoughts	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
some	1
spiritual	1
question	1
of	1
importance	1
had	1
been	1
interrupted	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
recall	1
what	1
yes	1
kostya	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
she	1
thought	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
well	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
then	1
better	1
let	1
him	1
always	1
be	1
one	1
than	1
like	1
madame	1
stahl	1
or	1
what	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
abroad	1
no	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
ever	1
sham	1
anything	1
and	1
a	1
recent	1
instance	1
of	1
his	1
goodness	1
rose	1
vividly	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
a	1
fortnight	1
ago	1
a	1
penitent	1
letter	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
stepan	1
arkadyevitch	1
to	1
dolly	1

besought	1
her	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
honor	1
to	1
sell	1
her	1
estate	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
debts	1

in	1

detested	1
her	1

despised	1
him	1
pitied	1
him	1
resolved	1
on	1
a	1
separation	1
resolved	1
to	1
refuse	1
but	1
ended	1
by	1
agreeing	1
to	1
sell	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
property	1
after	1
that	1
with	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
smile	1
of	1
tenderness	1
kitty	1
recalled	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
shamefaced	1
embarrassment	1
his	1
repeated	1
awkward	1
efforts	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
how	1
at	1
last	1
having	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
means	1
of	1
helping	1
dolly	1
without	1
wounding	1
her	1
pride	1
he	1
had	1
suggested	1
to	1
kitty	1
what	1
had	1
not	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
before	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
give	1
up	1
her	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
property	1

an	1
unbeliever	1

chapter	1
8	1
ever	1
since	1
by	1
his	1
beloved	1
brother	1
s	1
deathbed	1
levin	1
had	1
first	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
questions	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
these	1
new	1
convictions	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
during	1
the	1
period	1
from	1
his	1
twentieth	1
to	1
his	1
thirty	1
fourth	1
year	1
imperceptibly	1
replaced	1
his	1
childish	1
and	1
youthful	1
beliefs	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
stricken	1
with	1
horror	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
death	1
as	1
of	1
life	1
without	1
any	1
knowledge	1
of	1
whence	1
and	1
why	1
and	1
how	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
physical	1
organization	1
its	1
decay	1
the	1
indestructibility	1
of	1
matter	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
conservation	1
of	1
energy	1
evolution	1
were	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
usurped	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
belief	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
the	1
ideas	1
associated	1
with	1
them	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
intellectual	1
purposes	1
but	1
for	1
life	1
they	1
yielded	1
nothing	1
and	1
levin	1
felt	1
suddenly	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
changed	1
his	1
warm	1
fur	1
cloak	1
for	1
a	1
muslin	1
garment	1
and	1
going	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
into	1
the	1
frost	1
is	1
immediately	1
convinced	1
not	1
by	1
reason	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
whole	1
nature	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
naked	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
infallibly	1
perish	1
miserably	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
distinctly	1
face	1
it	1
and	1
still	1
went	1
on	1
living	1
as	1
before	1
levin	1
had	1
never	1
lost	1
this	1
sense	1
of	1
terror	1
at	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
knowledge	1
he	1
vaguely	1
felt	1
too	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
new	1
convictions	1
were	1
not	1
merely	1
lack	1
of	1
knowledge	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
order	1
of	1
ideas	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
needed	1
was	1
possible	1
at	1
first	1
marriage	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
joys	1
and	1
duties	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
it	1
had	1
completely	1
crowded	1
out	1
these	1
thoughts	1
but	1
of	1
late	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
staying	1
in	1
moscow	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
confinement	1
with	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
clamored	1
for	1
solution	1
had	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
insistently	1
haunted	1
levin	1
s	1
mind	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
summed	1
up	1
for	1
him	1
thus	1
if	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
accept	1
the	1
answers	1
christianity	1
gives	1
to	1
the	1
problems	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
what	1
answers	1
do	1
i	1
accept	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
arsenal	1
of	1
his	1
convictions	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
finding	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
answers	1
he	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
an	1
answer	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
seeking	1
food	1
in	1
toy	1
shops	1
and	1
tool	1
shops	1
instinctively	1
unconsciously	1
with	1
every	1
book	1
with	1
every	1
conversation	1
with	1
every	1
man	1
he	1
met	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
light	1
on	1
these	1
questions	1
and	1
their	1
solution	1
what	1
puzzled	1
and	1
distracted	1
him	1
above	1
everything	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
age	1
and	1
circle	1
had	1
like	1
him	1
exchanged	1
their	1
old	1
beliefs	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
new	1
convictions	1
and	1
yet	1
saw	1
nothing	1
to	1
lament	1
in	1
this	1
and	1
were	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
and	1
serene	1
so	1
that	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
principal	1
question	1
levin	1
was	1
tortured	1
by	1
other	1
questions	1
too	1
were	1
these	1
people	1
sincere	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
or	1
were	1
they	1
playing	1
a	1
part	1
or	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
they	1
understood	1
the	1
answers	1
science	1
gave	1
to	1
these	1
problems	1
in	1
some	1
different	1
clearer	1
sense	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
and	1
he	1
assiduously	1
studied	1
both	1
these	1
men	1
s	1
opinions	1
and	1
the	1
books	1
which	1
treated	1
of	1
these	1
scientific	1
explanations	1
one	1
fact	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
out	1
since	1
these	1
questions	1
had	1
engrossed	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
wrong	1
in	1
supposing	1
from	1
the	1
recollections	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
days	1
at	1
college	1
that	1
religion	1
had	1
outlived	1
its	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
practically	1
non	1
existent	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
were	1
good	1
in	1
their	1
lives	1
were	1
believers	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
lvov	1
whom	1
he	1
liked	1
so	1
much	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
believed	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
believed	1
as	1
simply	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
earliest	1
childhood	1
and	1
ninety	1
nine	1
hundredths	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
working	1
people	1
for	1
whose	1
life	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
deepest	1
respect	1
believed	1
another	1
fact	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
became	1
convinced	1
after	1
reading	1
many	1
scientific	1
books	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
shared	1
his	1
views	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
construction	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
gave	1
no	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
without	1
answering	1
but	1
simply	1
ignored	1
their	1
existence	1
and	1
attempted	1
to	1
explain	1
other	1
questions	1
of	1
no	1
possible	1
interest	1
to	1
him	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
organisms	1
the	1
materialistic	1
theory	1
of	1
consciousness	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
moreover	1
during	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
confinement	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
that	1
seemed	1
extraordinary	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
praying	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
prayed	1
he	1
believed	1
but	1
that	1
moment	1

the	1

who	1
gave	1
a	1
non	1

explanation	1
of	1

their	1
ideas	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1

himself	1

he	1

only	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
artificial	1
train	1
of	1
reasoning	1
and	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
life	1
itself	1
to	1
what	1
had	1
satisfied	1
him	1
while	1
thinking	1
in	1

with	1
the	1
fixed	1
definitions	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
artificial	1
edifice	1
fell	1
to	1
pieces	1
at	1
once	1
like	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
cards	1

it	1
became	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
edifice	1
had	1
been	1
built	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
transposed	1
words	1
apart	1
from	1
anything	1
in	1
life	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
reason	1
at	1
one	1

reading	1
schopenhauer	1

put	1
in	1

of	1
his	1

the	1
word	1
love	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days	1
this	1
new	1
philosophy	1
charmed	1
him	1
till	1
he	1
removed	1
a	1
little	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
but	1
then	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
from	1
life	1
itself	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
it	1
again	1
it	1
fell	1
away	1
too	1

proved	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
muslin	1
garment	1
with	1
no	1
warmth	1
in	1
it	1
his	1
brother	1

to	1

of	1

the	1

in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
elegant	1
epigrammatic	1
argumentative	1
style	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
repelled	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
at	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
divine	1
truths	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
vouchsafed	1
to	1
man	1
but	1
to	1
a	1
corporation	1
of	1
men	1
bound	1
together	1
by	1
love	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
what	1
delighted	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
thought	1
how	1
much	1
easier	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
a	1
still	1
existing	1
living	1
church	1
embracing	1
all	1
the	1
beliefs	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
having	1
god	1
at	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
therefore	1
holy	1
and	1
infallible	1
and	1
from	1
it	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
god	1
in	1
the	1
creation	1
the	1
fall	1
the	1
redemption	1
than	1
to	1
begin	1
with	1
god	1
a	1
mysterious	1
far	1
away	1
god	1
the	1

afterwards	1
on	1

a	1
catholic	1

deny	1
the	1
authority	1

lost	1
all	1

resolutely	1

without	1

indeed	1
in	1

was	1

more	1

unhesitating	1
in	1
life	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1

when	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1

at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1

he	1
went	1
back	1

management	1
of	1
the	1

his	1

taken	1
up	1
that	1
spring	1
filled	1
all	1
his	1
time	1
these	1
things	1
occupied	1
him	1
now	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
justified	1
them	1
to	1
himself	1
by	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
general	1
principles	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
former	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
disappointed	1
by	1
the	1
failure	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
efforts	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
welfare	1
and	1
too	1
much	1
occupied	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
thought	1
and	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
business	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
burdened	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
he	1
had	1
completely	1
given	1
up	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
and	1
he	1
busied	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
work	1
simply	1
because	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
otherwise	1
in	1
former	1
days	1
almost	1
from	1
childhood	1
and	1
increasingly	1
up	1
to	1
full	1
manhood	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
all	1
for	1
humanity	1
for	1
russia	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
village	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pleasant	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
itself	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
incoherent	1
that	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
full	1
conviction	1
of	1
its	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
had	1
begun	1
by	1
seeming	1
so	1
great	1
had	1
grown	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
till	1
it	1
vanished	1
into	1
nothing	1
but	1
now	1
since	1
his	1
marriage	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
confine	1
himself	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
living	1
for	1
himself	1
though	1
he	1
experienced	1
no	1
delight	1
at	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
complete	1
conviction	1
of	1
its	1
necessity	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
succeeded	1
far	1
better	1
than	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
kept	1
on	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
now	1
involuntarily	1
it	1
seemed	1
he	1
cut	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
soil	1
like	1
a	1
plough	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
drawn	1
out	1
without	1
turning	1
aside	1
the	1
furrow	1
to	1
live	1
the	1

incontestably	1

at	1
this	1
lack	1

the	1

was	1
one	1
of	1
levin	1
s	1
most	1
painful	1
days	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
busiest	1
working	1
time	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
peasantry	1
show	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
intensity	1
of	1
self	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
labor	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
never	1
shown	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
highly	1
esteemed	1
if	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
showed	1
these	1
qualities	1
themselves	1
thought	1
highly	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
repeated	1
every	1
year	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
this	1
intense	1
labor	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
simple	1
to	1
reap	1
and	1
bind	1
the	1
rye	1
and	1
oats	1
and	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
to	1
mow	1

over	1
the	1
fallows	1
thrash	1
the	1
seed	1
and	1
sow	1
the	1
winter	1
corn	1
all	1
this	1
seems	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
ordinary	1
but	1
to	1
succeed	1
in	1
getting	1
through	1
it	1
all	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
from	1
the	1

toil	1
incessantly	1
for	1
three	1

four	1

in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
closest	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
levin	1
always	1
felt	1
in	1
this	1
busy	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
infected	1
by	1
this	1
general	1
quickening	1
of	1
energy	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
morning	1
he	1
rode	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
sowing	1
of	1
the	1
rye	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
oats	1
which	1
were	1
being	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
stacks	1
and	1
returning	1
home	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
were	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
drank	1
coffee	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
farm	1
where	1
a	1
new	1
thrashing	1
machine	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
working	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
the	1
seed	1
corn	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
granary	1
still	1
fragrant	1
with	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
hazel	1
branches	1
interlaced	1
on	1
the	1
freshly	1
peeled	1
aspen	1
beams	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
thatch	1
roof	1
he	1
gazed	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
dry	1
bitter	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
thrashing	1
whirled	1
and	1
played	1
at	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
thrashing	1
floor	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight	1
and	1
the	1
fresh	1
straw	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
barn	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
speckly	1
headed	1
white	1
breasted	1
swallows	1
that	1
flew	1
chirping	1
in	1
under	1
the	1
roof	1
and	1
fluttering	1
their	1
wings	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
crevices	1
of	1
the	1
doorway	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
peasants	1
bustling	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
dusty	1
barn	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
strange	1
thoughts	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
being	1
done	1
he	1
thought	1
why	1
am	1
i	1
standing	1
here	1
making	1
them	1
work	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
all	1
so	1
busy	1
for	1
trying	1
to	1
show	1
their	1
zeal	1
before	1
me	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
old	1
matrona	1
my	1
old	1
friend	1
toiling	1
for	1
i	1
doctored	1
her	1
when	1
the	1
beam	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
thin	1
old	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
raking	1
up	1
the	1
grain	1
moving	1
painfully	1
with	1
her	1
bare	1
sun	1
blackened	1
feet	1
over	1
the	1
uneven	1
rough	1
floor	1
then	1
she	1
recovered	1
but	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow	1
or	1
in	1
ten	1
years	1
she	1
won	1
t	1
they	1
ll	1
bury	1
her	1
and	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
left	1
either	1
of	1
her	1
or	1
of	1
that	1
smart	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
red	1
jacket	1
who	1
with	1
that	1
skillful	1
soft	1
action	1
shakes	1
the	1
ears	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
husks	1
they	1
ll	1
bury	1
her	1
and	1
this	1
piebald	1
horse	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
too	1
he	1
thought	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
heavily	1
moving	1
panting	1
horse	1
that	1
kept	1
walking	1
up	1
the	1
wheel	1
that	1
turned	1
under	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
bury	1
her	1
and	1
fyodor	1
the	1
thrasher	1
with	1
his	1
curly	1
beard	1
full	1
of	1
chaff	1
and	1
his	1
shirt	1
torn	1
on	1
his	1
white	1
shoulders	1
they	1
will	1
bury	1
him	1

s	1
untying	1
the	1
sheaves	1
and	1
giving	1
orders	1
and	1
shouting	1
to	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
quickly	1
setting	1
straight	1
the	1
strap	1
on	1
the	1
moving	1
wheel	1
and	1
what	1
s	1
more	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
them	1
alone	1
me	1
they	1
ll	1
bury	1
too	1
and	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
left	1
what	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
this	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
to	1
reckon	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
thrashed	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
this	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
it	1
the	1
task	1
to	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
it	1
ll	1
soon	1

went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

that	1
was	1
feeding	1
the	1
machine	1
and	1
shouting	1
over	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
machine	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
in	1

put	1

dust	1
that	1
clung	1
to	1
his	1
moist	1
face	1
shouted	1
something	1
in	1
response	1
but	1
still	1
went	1
on	1
doing	1
it	1
as	1
levin	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
levin	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
barn	1
with	1
fyodor	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
talk	1
with	1
him	1
stopping	1
beside	1
a	1
neat	1
yellow	1
sheaf	1
of	1
rye	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1

from	1
a	1

at	1

that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
effort	1
of	1
thought	1
along	1
that	1
road	1
i	1

of	1

the	1

of	1
my	1

now	1

say	1
that	1
i	1
know	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
god	1
for	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
this	1
meaning	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
its	1
clearness	1
is	1
mysterious	1
and	1
marvelous	1
such	1
indeed	1
is	1
the	1

everything	1
existing	1

said	1
to	1
himself	1
turning	1
over	1
on	1
his	1

and	1
beginning	1
to	1
tie	1
a	1
noose	1
of	1
blades	1
of	1
grass	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
them	1
and	1
not	1
merely	1
pride	1
of	1
intellect	1

dulness	1
of	1
intellect	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
yes	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
intellect	1
the	1
cheating	1
knavishness	1
of	1
intellect	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
briefly	1
went	1
through	1
mentally	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
ideas	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
years	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
clear	1
confronting	1
of	1
death	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
dear	1
brother	1
hopelessly	1
ill	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
grasping	1
that	1
for	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
himself	1
too	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
store	1
but	1
suffering	1
death	1
and	1
forgetfulness	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
life	1
was	1
impossible	1
like	1
that	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
either	1
interpret	1
life	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
present	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
evil	1
jest	1
of	1
some	1
devil	1
or	1
shoot	1
himself	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
either	1
but	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
living	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
time	1
married	1
and	1
had	1
had	1
many	1
joys	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
happy	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
what	1
did	1
this	1
mean	1
it	1
meant	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
rightly	1
but	1
thinking	1
wrongly	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
without	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
on	1
those	1
spiritual	1
truths	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sucked	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1

milk	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
not	1
merely	1
without	1
recognition	1
of	1
these	1
truths	1
but	1
studiously	1
ignoring	1
them	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
live	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
beliefs	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
what	1

how	1
should	1
i	1
have	1

my	1

nothing	1

would	1

with	1
the	1

an	1

is	1
incommensurable	1
with	1
my	1

by	1

levin	1
remembered	1
a	1
scene	1
he	1
had	1
lately	1
witnessed	1
between	1
dolly	1
and	1
her	1
children	1
the	1
children	1
left	1
to	1
themselves	1
had	1
begun	1
cooking	1
raspberries	1
over	1
the	1
candles	1
and	1
squirting	1
milk	1
into	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
mouths	1
with	1
a	1
syringe	1
their	1
mother	1
catching	1
them	1
at	1
these	1
pranks	1
began	1
reminding	1
them	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
trouble	1
their	1
mischief	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
trouble	1
was	1
all	1
for	1
their	1
sake	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
smashed	1
the	1
cups	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
drink	1
their	1
tea	1
out	1
of	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
wasted	1
the	1
milk	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
die	1
of	1
hunger	1
and	1
levin	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
passive	1
weary	1
incredulity	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
heard	1
what	1
their	1
mother	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
simply	1
annoyed	1
that	1
their	1
amusing	1
play	1
had	1
been	1
interrupted	1

did	1
not	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
saying	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
indeed	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
immensity	1
of	1
all	1
they	1
habitually	1
enjoyed	1
and	1
so	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
destroying	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
they	1
lived	1
by	1
that	1
all	1
comes	1
of	1
itself	1
they	1
thought	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
interesting	1
or	1
important	1
about	1
it	1
because	1
it	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
so	1
and	1
always	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
we	1
ve	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
ready	1
but	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
invent	1
something	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
and	1
new	1
so	1
we	1
thought	1
of	1
putting	1
raspberries	1
in	1
a	1
cup	1
and	1
cooking	1
them	1
over	1
a	1
candle	1
and	1
squirting	1
milk	1
straight	1
into	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
mouths	1
that	1
s	1
fun	1
and	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
worse	1
than	1
drinking	1
out	1
of	1
cups	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
searching	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
all	1
the	1
theories	1
of	1
philosophy	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
trying	1
by	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
thought	1
which	1
is	1
strange	1
and	1
not	1
natural	1
to	1
man	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
known	1
long	1
ago	1
and	1
knows	1
so	1
certainly	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
at	1
all	1
without	1
it	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
distinctly	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
each	1
philosopher	1
s	1
theory	1
that	1
he	1
knows	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
significance	1
of	1
life	1
beforehand	1
just	1
as	1
positively	1
as	1
the	1
peasant	1
fyodor	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
he	1
and	1
is	1
simply	1
trying	1
by	1
a	1
dubious	1
intellectual	1
path	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
what	1
everyone	1
knows	1
now	1
then	1
leave	1
the	1
children	1
to	1
themselves	1
to	1
get	1
things	1
alone	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
crockery	1
get	1
the	1
milk	1
from	1
the	1
cows	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
would	1
they	1
be	1
naughty	1
then	1
why	1
they	1
d	1
die	1
of	1
hunger	1
well	1
then	1
leave	1
us	1
with	1
our	1
passions	1
and	1
thoughts	1
without	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
god	1
of	1
the	1
creator	1
or	1
without	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
without	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
moral	1
evil	1
just	1
try	1
and	1
build	1
up	1
anything	1
without	1
those	1
ideas	1
we	1
only	1
try	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
because	1
we	1
re	1
spiritually	1
provided	1
for	1
exactly	1
like	1
the	1
children	1
whence	1
have	1
i	1
that	1
joyful	1
knowledge	1
shared	1
with	1
the	1
peasant	1
that	1
alone	1
gives	1
peace	1
to	1
my	1
soul	1
whence	1
did	1
i	1
get	1
it	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
god	1
a	1
christian	1
my	1
whole	1
life	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
spiritual	1
blessings	1
christianity	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
full	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
living	1
on	1
those	1
blessings	1
like	1
the	1
children	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
and	1
destroy	1
that	1
is	1
try	1
to	1
destroy	1
what	1
i	1
live	1
by	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
an	1
important	1
moment	1
of	1
life	1
comes	1
like	1
the	1
children	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
cold	1
and	1
hungry	1
i	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
when	1
their	1
mother	1
scolds	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
childish	1
mischief	1
do	1
i	1
feel	1
that	1
my	1
childish	1
efforts	1
at	1
wanton	1
madness	1
are	1
reckoned	1
against	1
me	1
yes	1
what	1
i	1
know	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
by	1
reason	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
heart	1
by	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
taught	1
by	1
the	1
church	1
the	1

the	1
church	1
levin	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
turned	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
and	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
fell	1
to	1
gazing	1
into	1
the	1
distance	1
at	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
crossing	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
but	1
can	1
i	1
believe	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
church	1
teaches	1
he	1
thought	1
trying	1
himself	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
could	1
destroy	1
his	1
present	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
intentionally	1
he	1
recalled	1
all	1
those	1
doctrines	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
seemed	1
most	1
strange	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
stumbling	1
block	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
creation	1
but	1
how	1
did	1
i	1
explain	1
existence	1
by	1
existence	1
by	1
nothing	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
sin	1
but	1
how	1
do	1
i	1
explain	1
evil	1
the	1
atonement	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
nothing	1
nothing	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
know	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
told	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1

that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1

could	1

levin	1
looked	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
then	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
trap	1
with	1
raven	1
in	1
the	1
shafts	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
who	1
driving	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
herd	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
herdsman	1
then	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
snort	1
of	1
the	1
sleek	1
horse	1
close	1
by	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wonder	1
why	1
the	1
coachman	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
only	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
coachman	1
had	1
driven	1
quite	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
shouted	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
mistress	1
sent	1
me	1
your	1
brother	1
has	1
come	1
and	1
some	1
gentleman	1
with	1
him	1
levin	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
reins	1
as	1
though	1
just	1
roused	1
out	1
of	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
levin	1
could	1
not	1
collect	1
his	1
faculties	1
he	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
sleek	1
horse	1
flecked	1
with	1
lather	1
between	1
his	1
haunches	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
where	1
the	1
harness	1
rubbed	1
stared	1
at	1
ivan	1
the	1
coachman	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him	1
and	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
expecting	1
his	1
brother	1
thought	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
most	1
likely	1
uneasy	1
at	1
his	1
long	1
absence	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
guess	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
visitor	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
unknown	1
guest	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
before	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
now	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
all	1
men	1
would	1
be	1
different	1
with	1
my	1
brother	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
aloofness	1
there	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
between	1
us	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
disputes	1
with	1
kitty	1
there	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
quarrels	1
with	1
the	1
visitor	1
whoever	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
i	1
will	1
be	1
friendly	1
and	1
nice	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
with	1
ivan	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
different	1
pulling	1
the	1
stiff	1
rein	1
and	1
holding	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
horse	1
that	1
snorted	1
with	1
impatience	1
and	1
seemed	1
begging	1
to	1
be	1
let	1
go	1
levin	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
ivan	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
unoccupied	1
hand	1
continually	1
pressing	1
down	1
his	1
shirt	1
as	1
it	1
puffed	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
about	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
ivan	1
had	1
pulled	1
the	1
saddle	1
girth	1
up	1
too	1
high	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
like	1
blame	1
and	1
he	1
longed	1
for	1
friendly	1
warm	1
talk	1
nothing	1
else	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
your	1
honor	1
must	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
mind	1
that	1
stump	1
said	1
the	1
coachman	1
pulling	1
the	1
rein	1
levin	1
held	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
touch	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
teach	1
me	1
said	1
levin	1
angered	1
by	1
this	1
interference	1
now	1
as	1
always	1
interference	1
made	1
him	1
angry	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
sorrowfully	1
at	1
once	1
how	1
mistaken	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
supposition	1
that	1
his	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
could	1
immediately	1
change	1
him	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
reality	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
home	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
grisha	1
and	1
tanya	1
running	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
uncle	1
kostya	1
mamma	1
s	1
coming	1
and	1
grandfather	1
and	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
someone	1
else	1
they	1
said	1
clambering	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
an	1
awfully	1
terrible	1
person	1
and	1
he	1
does	1
like	1
this	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
said	1
tanya	1
getting	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
mimicking	1
katavasov	1
old	1
or	1
young	1
asked	1
levin	1
laughing	1
reminded	1
of	1
someone	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whom	1
by	1
tanya	1
s	1
performance	1
oh	1
i	1
hope	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
tiresome	1
person	1
thought	1
levin	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
at	1
a	1
bend	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
party	1
coming	1
levin	1
recognized	1
katavasov	1
in	1
a	1
straw	1
hat	1
walking	1
along	1
swinging	1
his	1
arms	1
just	1
as	1
tanya	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
katavasov	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
discussing	1
metaphysics	1
having	1
derived	1
his	1
notions	1
from	1
natural	1
science	1
writers	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
studied	1
metaphysics	1
and	1
in	1
moscow	1
levin	1
had	1
had	1
many	1
arguments	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
late	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
arguments	1
in	1
which	1
katavasov	1
had	1
obviously	1
considered	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
off	1
victorious	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
levin	1
thought	1
of	1
as	1
he	1
recognized	1
him	1
no	1
whatever	1
i	1
do	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
argue	1
and	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
my	1
ideas	1
lightly	1
he	1
thought	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
greeting	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
katavasov	1
levin	1
asked	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
she	1
has	1
taken	1
mitya	1
to	1
kolok	1
a	1
copse	1
near	1
the	1
house	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
out	1
there	1
because	1
it	1
s	1
so	1

not	1
to	1
take	1
the	1

to	1
the	1

thinking	1
it	1

he	1

this	1

about	1

to	1

beside	1
him	1
oh	1
nothing	1
special	1
busy	1
as	1
usual	1
with	1
the	1

answered	1
levin	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
about	1
you	1
come	1
for	1
long	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
expecting	1
you	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
i	1
ve	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
moscow	1
at	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
brothers	1
eyes	1
met	1
and	1
levin	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
desire	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
stronger	1
than	1
ever	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
affectionate	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
open	1
terms	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
felt	1
an	1
awkwardness	1
in	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
casting	1
over	1
the	1
subjects	1
of	1
conversation	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
pleasant	1
to	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
would	1
keep	1
him	1
off	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
servian	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
slavonic	1
question	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hinted	1
by	1
the	1
allusion	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
moscow	1
levin	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
book	1
well	1
have	1
there	1
been	1
reviews	1
of	1
your	1
book	1
he	1
asked	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
intentional	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
interested	1
in	1
that	1
now	1
and	1
i	1
less	1
than	1
anyone	1
he	1
said	1
just	1
look	1
darya	1
alexandrovna	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
shower	1
he	1
added	1
pointing	1
with	1
a	1
sunshade	1
at	1
the	1
white	1
rain	1
clouds	1
that	1
showed	1
above	1
the	1
aspen	1
tree	1
tops	1
and	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
enough	1
to	1
re	1
establish	1
again	1
between	1
the	1
brothers	1
that	1
tone	1
hardly	1
hostile	1
but	1
chilly	1
which	1
levin	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
longing	1
to	1
avoid	1
levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
katavasov	1
it	1
was	1
jolly	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
your	1
mind	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
now	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
some	1
discussion	1
we	1
ll	1

to	1
that	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
reading	1
spencer	1
no	1
i	1
ve	1
not	1
finished	1
reading	1
him	1
said	1
levin	1
but	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
need	1
him	1
now	1
how	1
s	1
that	1
that	1
s	1
interesting	1
why	1
so	1
i	1
mean	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
fully	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
problems	1
that	1
interest	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
like	1
now	1
but	1
katavasov	1
s	1
serene	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
expression	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
such	1
tenderness	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
happy	1
mood	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
disturbing	1
by	1
this	1
conversation	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
resolution	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
but	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
later	1
on	1
he	1
added	1
if	1
we	1
re	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
bee	1
house	1
it	1
s	1
this	1
way	1
along	1
this	1
little	1
path	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
them	1
all	1
going	1
along	1
the	1
narrow	1
path	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
uncut	1
meadow	1
covered	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
with	1
thick	1
clumps	1
of	1
brilliant	1
heart	1
s	1
ease	1
among	1
which	1
stood	1
up	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
tall	1
dark	1
green	1
tufts	1
of	1
hellebore	1
levin	1
settled	1
his	1
guests	1
in	1
the	1
dense	1
cool	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
aspens	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
and	1
some	1
stumps	1
purposely	1
put	1
there	1
for	1
visitors	1
to	1
the	1
bee	1
house	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
bees	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
hut	1
to	1
get	1
bread	1
cucumbers	1
and	1
fresh	1
honey	1
to	1
regale	1
them	1
with	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
movements	1
as	1
deliberate	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
bees	1
that	1
buzzed	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
past	1
him	1
he	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
little	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
hut	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
entry	1
one	1
bee	1
hummed	1
angrily	1
caught	1
in	1
his	1
beard	1
but	1
he	1
carefully	1
extricated	1
it	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
shady	1
outer	1
room	1
he	1
took	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
his	1
veil	1
that	1
hung	1
on	1
a	1
peg	1
and	1
putting	1
it	1
on	1
and	1
thrusting	1
his	1
hands	1
into	1
his	1
pockets	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
fenced	1
in	1
bee	1
garden	1
where	1
there	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
closely	1
mown	1
space	1
in	1
regular	1
rows	1
fastened	1
with	1
bast	1
on	1
posts	1
all	1
the	1
hives	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
the	1
old	1
stocks	1
each	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
history	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
fences	1
the	1
younger	1
swarms	1
hived	1
that	1
year	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
openings	1
of	1
the	1
hives	1
it	1
made	1
his	1
eyes	1
giddy	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
bees	1
and	1
drones	1
whirling	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
while	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
working	1
bees	1
flew	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
with	1
spoils	1
or	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
them	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
to	1
the	1
flowering	1
lime	1
trees	1
and	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
hives	1
his	1
ears	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
incessant	1
hum	1
in	1
various	1
notes	1
now	1
the	1
busy	1
hum	1
of	1
the	1
working	1
bee	1
flying	1
quickly	1
off	1
then	1
the	1
blaring	1
of	1
the	1
lazy	1
drone	1
and	1
the	1
excited	1
buzz	1
of	1
the	1
bees	1
on	1
guard	1
protecting	1
their	1
property	1
from	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
preparing	1
to	1
sting	1
on	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fence	1
the	1
old	1
bee	1
keeper	1
was	1
shaving	1
a	1
hoop	1
for	1
a	1
tub	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
levin	1
levin	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
beehives	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
call	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
to	1
recover	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
ordinary	1
actual	1
life	1
which	1
had	1
already	1
depressed	1
his	1
happy	1
mood	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
temper	1
with	1
ivan	1
to	1
show	1
coolness	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
to	1
talk	1
flippantly	1
with	1
katavasov	1
can	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
a	1
momentary	1
mood	1
and	1
will	1
it	1
pass	1
and	1
leave	1
no	1
trace	1
he	1
thought	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
mood	1
he	1
felt	1
with	1
delight	1
that	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
important	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
real	1
life	1
had	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
overcast	1
the	1
spiritual	1
peace	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
untouched	1
within	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
bees	1
whirling	1
round	1
him	1
now	1
menacing	1
him	1
and	1
distracting	1
his	1
attention	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
enjoying	1
complete	1
physical	1
peace	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
movements	1
to	1
avoid	1
them	1
so	1
had	1
the	1
petty	1
cares	1
that	1
had	1
swarmed	1
about	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
restricted	1
his	1
spiritual	1
freedom	1
but	1
that	1
lasted	1
only	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
among	1
them	1
just	1
as	1
his	1
bodily	1
strength	1
was	1
still	1
unaffected	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
bees	1
so	1
too	1
was	1
the	1
spiritual	1
strength	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
become	1
aware	1
of	1
chapter	1
15	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
kostya	1
with	1
whom	1
sergey	1

he	1
added	1
glancing	1
at	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
he	1
was	1
carefully	1
with	1
a	1
blunt	1
knife	1
getting	1
a	1
live	1
bee	1
covered	1
with	1
sticky	1
honey	1
out	1
of	1

full	1
of	1

with	1
a	1
juicy	1
sound	1
into	1

what	1
is	1
one	1
to	1
make	1
of	1

to	1
me	1

ivanovitch	1
where	1
are	1
all	1
those	1
volunteers	1
going	1
whom	1
are	1
they	1
fighting	1
with	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
unmistakably	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
conversation	1
that	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
in	1
levin	1
s	1
absence	1
with	1
the	1
turks	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
answered	1
smiling	1
serenely	1
as	1
he	1
extricated	1
the	1
bee	1
dark	1
with	1
honey	1
and	1
helplessly	1
kicking	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
knife	1
on	1
a	1

assisted	1

declared	1

people	1
sympathize	1
with	1
their	1
neighbors	1
sufferings	1
and	1
are	1
eager	1
to	1
help	1
them	1
said	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
but	1
the	1
prince	1
is	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
help	1
said	1
levin	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
but	1
of	1
war	1
the	1
prince	1
says	1
that	1

persons	1
cannot	1
take	1
part	1
in	1

without	1
the	1
permission	1
of	1

s	1
a	1
bee	1
really	1
they	1

sting	1
us	1
said	1
dolly	1
waving	1
away	1
a	1
wasp	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
bee	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
wasp	1
said	1
levin	1
well	1
now	1
well	1
what	1
s	1
your	1
own	1
theory	1
katavasov	1
said	1
to	1
levin	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
distinctly	1
challenging	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
discussion	1
why	1
have	1
not	1
private	1
persons	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
oh	1
my	1
theory	1
s	1
this	1
war	1
is	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
such	1
a	1
beastly	1
cruel	1
and	1
awful	1
thing	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
a	1
christian	1
can	1
individually	1
take	1
upon	1
himself	1
the	1
responsibility	1
of	1
beginning	1
wars	1
that	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
government	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
and	1
is	1
driven	1
inevitably	1
into	1
war	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
both	1
political	1
science	1
and	1
common	1
sense	1
teach	1
us	1
that	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
state	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
war	1
private	1
citizens	1
must	1
forego	1
their	1
personal	1
individual	1
will	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
and	1
katavasov	1
had	1
their	1
replies	1
ready	1
and	1
both	1
began	1
speaking	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
but	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
cases	1
when	1
the	1
government	1
does	1
not	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
public	1
asserts	1
its	1
will	1
said	1
katavasov	1
but	1
evidently	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
this	1
answer	1
his	1
brows	1
contracted	1
at	1
katavasov	1
s	1
words	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
else	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
its	1
true	1
light	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
question	1
here	1
of	1
a	1
declaration	1
of	1
war	1
but	1
simply	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
christian	1
feeling	1
our	1
brothers	1
one	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
religion	1
and	1
in	1
race	1
are	1
being	1
massacred	1
even	1
supposing	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
our	1
brothers	1
nor	1
fellow	1
christians	1
but	1
simply	1
children	1
women	1
old	1

beating	1
a	1

not	1
stop	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
war	1
had	1
been	1
declared	1
on	1
the	1
men	1

would	1
throw	1
yourself	1
on	1
them	1
and	1
protect	1
the	1
victim	1

i	1
should	1
not	1
kill	1
them	1
said	1

yes	1
you	1
would	1
kill	1
them	1
i	1
don	1

that	1
i	1
might	1

way	1
to	1
my	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
say	1
beforehand	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
momentary	1
impulse	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
and	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
slavonic	1
peoples	1
possibly	1
for	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
not	1

for	1

with	1

of	1
the	1

have	1
spoken	1
perhaps	1
so	1
said	1

evasively	1

i	1
don	1
t	1

up	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
bulgarian	1
atrocities	1
i	1
couldn	1
t	1
make	1
out	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
russians	1
were	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
their	1

the	1

rejoice	1
us	1
at	1
the	1

time	1
twenty	1
years	1

we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
silent	1

now	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
people	1
which	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
rise	1
as	1
one	1
man	1

ready	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
itself	1
for	1
its	1

is	1

levin	1
reddened	1
with	1
vexation	1
not	1
at	1

at	1
having	1

he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
convince	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
katavasov	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
even	1
less	1
possibility	1
of	1
himself	1
agreeing	1
with	1
them	1
what	1
they	1
advocated	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
pride	1
of	1
intellect	1
that	1
had	1
almost	1
been	1
his	1
ruin	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
that	1
some	1
dozens	1
of	1
men	1
among	1
them	1
his	1
brother	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
told	1
by	1
some	1
hundreds	1
of	1
glib	1
volunteers	1
swarming	1
to	1
the	1
capital	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
and	1
the	1
newspapers	1
were	1
expressing	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
which	1
was	1
expressed	1
in	1
vengeance	1
and	1
murder	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
this	1
because	1
he	1
neither	1
saw	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
such	1
feelings	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
among	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
nor	1
found	1
them	1
in	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
consider	1
himself	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
making	1
up	1
the	1
russian	1
people	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
because	1
he	1
like	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
that	1
this	1
general	1
good	1
could	1
be	1
attained	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
strict	1
observance	1
of	1
that	1
law	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
every	1
man	1

therefore	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1

advocate	1
war	1
for	1
any	1
general	1
objects	1
whatever	1
he	1

to	1

account	1
the	1

had	1
foregone	1
this	1
privilege	1
they	1
had	1
bought	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
costly	1

so	1
it	1
was	1

then	1
called	1
the	1

the	1
fact	1

flash	1

the	1
green	1
crest	1
of	1
the	1
familiar	1
oak	1

in	1
the	1

more	1
rapidly	1
the	1
oak	1
tree	1
vanished	1
behind	1
the	1
other	1
trees	1

he	1
heard	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
tree	1
falling	1
upon	1
the	1
others	1
the	1
flash	1
of	1

the	1
crash	1
of	1

the	1

that	1

sense	1

his	1
prayer	1
that	1

the	1

in	1
good	1
spirits	1
and	1
at	1
tea	1
his	1
brother	1
drew	1
him	1
on	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
of	1
the	1
eastern	1
question	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
so	1
simply	1
and	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
everyone	1
listened	1
eagerly	1
kitty	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
it	1
all	1
she	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
give	1
mitya	1
his	1
bath	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
kitty	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
sent	1
for	1
levin	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
leaving	1
his	1
tea	1
and	1
regretfully	1
interrupting	1
the	1
interesting	1
conversation	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
uneasily	1
wondering	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
for	1
as	1
this	1
only	1
happened	1
on	1
important	1
occasions	1
levin	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
although	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
interested	1
by	1
sergey	1
ivanovitch	1
s	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
epoch	1
in	1
history	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
created	1
by	1
the	1
emancipation	1
of	1
forty	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
slavonic	1
race	1
acting	1
with	1
russia	1
a	1
conception	1
quite	1
new	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
although	1
he	1
was	1
disturbed	1
by	1
uneasy	1
wonder	1
at	1
being	1
sent	1
for	1
by	1
kitty	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
was	1
alone	1
his	1
mind	1
reverted	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
theories	1
of	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
slav	1
element	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
trivial	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
soul	1
that	1
he	1
instantly	1
forgot	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
dropped	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
that	1
morning	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
recall	1
the	1
whole	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
need	1
he	1
fell	1
back	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
feeling	1
which	1
had	1
guided	1
him	1
which	1
was	1
connected	1
with	1
those	1
thoughts	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
feeling	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
even	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
definite	1
than	1
before	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
previous	1
attempts	1
to	1
find	1
comforting	1
arguments	1
need	1
to	1
revive	1
a	1
whole	1
chain	1
of	1
thought	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
feeling	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
peace	1
was	1
keener	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
thought	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
feeling	1
he	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
terrace	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
two	1
stars	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
darkening	1
sky	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
remembered	1
yes	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
dome	1
that	1
i	1
see	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
deception	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
thought	1
something	1
i	1
shirked	1
facing	1
something	1
he	1
mused	1
but	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
disproving	1
it	1
i	1
have	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
come	1
clear	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
nursery	1
he	1
remembered	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
had	1
shirked	1
facing	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
chief	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
divinity	1
was	1
his	1
revelation	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
this	1
revelation	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
christian	1
church	1
alone	1
what	1
relation	1
to	1
this	1
revelation	1
have	1
the	1
beliefs	1
of	1
the	1
buddhists	1
mohammedans	1
who	1
preached	1
and	1
did	1
good	1
too	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
formulate	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
nursery	1
kitty	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
her	1
sleeves	1
tucked	1
up	1
over	1
the	1
baby	1
in	1
the	1
bath	1
hearing	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
footstep	1
she	1
turned	1
towards	1
him	1
summoning	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
smile	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
she	1
was	1
supporting	1
the	1
fat	1
baby	1
that	1
lay	1
floating	1
and	1
sprawling	1
on	1
its	1
back	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
squeezed	1
the	1
sponge	1
over	1
him	1
come	1

said	1
when	1
her	1

came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
agafea	1
mihalovna	1
s	1
right	1
he	1
knows	1
us	1
mitya	1
had	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
given	1
unmistakable	1
incontestable	1
signs	1
of	1
recognizing	1
all	1
his	1
friends	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
levin	1
approached	1
the	1
bath	1
the	1
experiment	1
was	1
tried	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
completely	1
successful	1
the	1
cook	1
sent	1
for	1
with	1
this	1
object	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
baby	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disapprovingly	1
kitty	1
bent	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
beaming	1
smile	1
propped	1
his	1
little	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
sponge	1
and	1
chirruped	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
queer	1
little	1
contented	1
sound	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
kitty	1
and	1
the	1
nurse	1
were	1
not	1
alone	1
in	1
their	1
admiration	1
levin	1
too	1
was	1
surprised	1
and	1
delighted	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bath	1
drenched	1
with	1
water	1
wrapped	1
in	1
towels	1
dried	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
piercing	1
scream	1
handed	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
well	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
beginning	1
to	1
love	1
him	1

kitty	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
settled	1
herself	1
comfortably	1
in	1
her	1
usual	1
place	1
with	1
the	1
baby	1
at	1
her	1
breast	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
it	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
distress	1
me	1
you	1
said	1
you	1
had	1
no	1
feeling	1
for	1
him	1
no	1
did	1
i	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
only	1
said	1
i	1
was	1
disappointed	1
what	1
disappointed	1
in	1
him	1
not	1
disappointed	1
in	1
him	1
but	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
feeling	1
i	1
had	1
expected	1
more	1
i	1
had	1
expected	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
new	1
delightful	1
emotion	1
to	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
surprise	1
and	1
then	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
disgust	1
pity	1
she	1
listened	1
attentively	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
baby	1
while	1
she	1
put	1
back	1
on	1
her	1
slender	1
fingers	1
the	1
rings	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
while	1
giving	1
mitya	1
his	1

and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
at	1
there	1
being	1
far	1
more	1
apprehension	1
and	1
pity	1
than	1
pleasure	1
today	1
after	1
that	1
fright	1
during	1
the	1
storm	1

was	1
i	1
too	1

now	1
that	1

going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
being	1
again	1
alone	1
levin	1
went	1
back	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
thought	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
clear	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
heard	1
voices	1
he	1
stopped	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
parapet	1
he	1
gazed	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
dark	1
now	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
clouds	1
the	1
storm	1
had	1
drifted	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
flashes	1
of	1
lightning	1
and	1
distant	1
thunder	1
from	1
that	1
quarter	1
levin	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
monotonous	1
drip	1
from	1
the	1
lime	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
triangle	1
of	1
stars	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
the	1
milky	1
way	1
with	1
its	1
branches	1
that	1
ran	1
through	1
its	1
midst	1
at	1
each	1
flash	1
of	1
lightning	1
the	1
milky	1
way	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
bright	1
stars	1
vanished	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
lightning	1
died	1
away	1
they	1
reappeared	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
hand	1
had	1
flung	1
them	1
back	1
with	1
careful	1
aim	1
well	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
perplexes	1
me	1
levin	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
feeling	1
beforehand	1
that	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
his	1
difficulties	1
was	1
ready	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
yet	1
yes	1
the	1
one	1
unmistakable	1
incontestable	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
divinity	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
revelation	1
and	1
which	1
i	1
feel	1
in	1
myself	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
make	1
myself	1

whether	1
i	1
will	1

not	1
i	1
am	1

what	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
put	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
question	1

feared	1
to	1
face	1

these	1
hundreds	1

deprived	1
of	1
that	1

blessing	1
without	1
which	1
life	1

no	1

he	1
pondered	1
a	1
moment	1

immediately	1
corrected	1
himself	1
but	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
questioning	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
i	1
am	1
questioning	1
the	1
relation	1
to	1
divinity	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
different	1
religions	1
of	1
all	1
mankind	1
i	1
am	1
questioning	1
the	1
universal	1
manifestation	1
of	1
god	1
to	1
all	1
the	1

with	1
all	1

about	1

to	1
my	1

been	1

a	1
knowledge	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt	1
and	1
unattainable	1
by	1
reason	1
and	1
here	1
i	1
am	1
obstinately	1
trying	1
to	1
express	1
that	1
knowledge	1
in	1
reason	1
and	1
words	1
don	1
t	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
don	1
t	1
move	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
bright	1
planet	1
which	1
had	1
shifted	1
its	1
position	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
topmost	1

looking	1
at	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1

i	1
can	1
t	1
picture	1
to	1
myself	1
the	1
rotation	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
right	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
move	1
and	1
could	1
the	1
astronomers	1
have	1
understood	1
and	1
calculated	1
anything	1

they	1

taken	1
into	1
account	1
all	1
the	1
complicated	1
and	1
varied	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
all	1
the	1

reached	1
about	1
the	1

weights	1

deflections	1
of	1
the	1

on	1
the	1

motions	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
about	1
a	1
stationary	1
earth	1
on	1
that	1
very	1
motion	1
i	1
see	1
before	1
me	1
now	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
during	1
long	1
ages	1
and	1
was	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
alike	1
and	1
can	1
always	1
be	1
trusted	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
conclusions	1
of	1
the	1
astronomers	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
vain	1
and	1
uncertain	1
if	1
not	1
founded	1
on	1
observations	1
of	1
the	1
seen	1
heavens	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
a	1
single	1
meridian	1
and	1
a	1
single	1
horizon	1
so	1
would	1
my	1
conclusions	1
be	1
vain	1
and	1
uncertain	1
if	1
not	1
founded	1
on	1
that	1
conception	1
of	1
right	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
alike	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
christian	1
and	1
which	1
can	1
always	1
be	1
trusted	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
other	1
religions	1
and	1
their	1
relations	1

i	1
have	1
no	1

no	1

oh	1
you	1

he	1

at	1

came	1
by	1
the	1
