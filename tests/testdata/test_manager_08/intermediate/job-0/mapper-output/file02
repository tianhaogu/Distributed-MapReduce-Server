it	1
is	1
a	1
truth	1
universally	1
acknowledged	1
that	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
fortune	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
however	1
little	1
known	1
the	1
feelings	1
or	1
views	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
be	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
entering	1
a	1
neighbourhood	1
this	1
truth	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
surrounding	1
families	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
considered	1
the	1
rightful	1
property	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
their	1
daughters	1
my	1
dear	1
mr	1
bennet	1
said	1
his	1
lady	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
day	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
that	1
netherfield	1
park	1
is	1
let	1
at	1
last	1
mr	1
bennet	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
returned	1
she	1
for	1
mrs	1
long	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
here	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
mr	1
bennet	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it	1
cried	1
his	1
wife	1
impatiently	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
hearing	1
it	1
this	1
was	1
invitation	1
enough	1
why	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
mrs	1
long	1
says	1
that	1
netherfield	1
is	1
taken	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
large	1
fortune	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
england	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
on	1
monday	1
in	1
a	1
chaise	1
and	1
four	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
delighted	1
with	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
agreed	1
with	1
mr	1
morris	1
immediately	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
possession	1
before	1
michaelmas	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
next	1
week	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
name	1
bingley	1
is	1
he	1
married	1
or	1
single	1
oh	1
single	1
my	1
dear	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
of	1
large	1
fortune	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
what	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
for	1
our	1
girls	1
how	1
so	1
how	1
can	1
it	1
affect	1
them	1
my	1
dear	1
mr	1
bennet	1
replied	1
his	1
wife	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
tiresome	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
marrying	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
that	1
his	1
design	1
in	1
settling	1
here	1
design	1
nonsense	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
so	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
likely	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
therefore	1
you	1
must	1
visit	1
him	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
comes	1
i	1
see	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
may	1
go	1
or	1
you	1
may	1
send	1
them	1
by	1
themselves	1
which	1
perhaps	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
better	1
for	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
as	1
handsome	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
mr	1
bingley	1
may	1
like	1
you	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
flatter	1
me	1
i	1
certainly	1
have	1
had	1
my	1
share	1
of	1
beauty	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
extraordinary	1
now	1
when	1
a	1
woman	1
has	1
five	1
grown	1
up	1
daughters	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
over	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
beauty	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
a	1
woman	1
has	1
not	1
often	1
much	1
beauty	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
must	1
indeed	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
mr	1
bingley	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
into	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
i	1
engage	1
for	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
but	1
consider	1
your	1
daughters	1
only	1
think	1
what	1
an	1
establishment	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
sir	1
william	1
and	1
lady	1
lucas	1
are	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
merely	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
for	1
in	1
general	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
visit	1
no	1
newcomers	1
indeed	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
you	1
are	1
over	1
scrupulous	1
surely	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
mr	1
bingley	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
by	1
you	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
hearty	1
consent	1
to	1
his	1
marrying	1
whichever	1
he	1
chooses	1
of	1
the	1
girls	1
though	1
i	1
must	1
throw	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
for	1
my	1
little	1
lizzy	1
i	1
desire	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
lizzy	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
half	1
so	1
handsome	1
as	1
jane	1
nor	1
half	1
so	1
good	1
humoured	1
as	1
lydia	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
giving	1
her	1
the	1
preference	1
they	1
have	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
much	1
to	1
recommend	1
them	1
replied	1
he	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
silly	1
and	1
ignorant	1
like	1
other	1
girls	1
but	1
lizzy	1
has	1
something	1
more	1
of	1
quickness	1
than	1
her	1
sisters	1
mr	1
bennet	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
abuse	1
your	1
own	1
children	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
you	1
take	1
delight	1
in	1
vexing	1
me	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
compassion	1
for	1
my	1
poor	1
nerves	1
you	1
mistake	1
me	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
high	1
respect	1
for	1
your	1
nerves	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
old	1
friends	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
mention	1
them	1
with	1
consideration	1
these	1
last	1
twenty	1
years	1
at	1
least	1
ah	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
i	1
suffer	1
but	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
get	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
many	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
four	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
us	1
if	1
twenty	1
such	1
should	1
come	1
since	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
visit	1
them	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
my	1
dear	1
that	1
when	1
there	1
are	1
twenty	1
i	1
will	1
visit	1
them	1
all	1
mr	1
bennet	1
was	1
so	1
odd	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
quick	1
parts	1
sarcastic	1
humour	1
reserve	1
and	1
caprice	1
that	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
three	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
had	1
been	1
insufficient	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
wife	1
understand	1
his	1
character	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
less	1
difficult	1
to	1
develop	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
mean	1
understanding	1
little	1
information	1
and	1
uncertain	1
temper	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
discontented	1
she	1
fancied	1
herself	1
nervous	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
daughters	1
married	1
its	1
solace	1
was	1
visiting	1
and	1
news	1
chapter	1
2	1
mr	1
bennet	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
earliest	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
waited	1
on	1
mr	1
bingley	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
intended	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
though	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
always	1
assuring	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
evening	1
after	1
the	1
visit	1
was	1
paid	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
disclosed	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
manner	1
observing	1
his	1
second	1
daughter	1
employed	1
in	1
trimming	1
a	1
hat	1
he	1
suddenly	1
addressed	1
her	1
with	1
i	1
hope	1
mr	1
bingley	1
will	1
like	1
it	1
lizzy	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
mr	1
bingley	1
likes	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
resentfully	1
since	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
visit	1
but	1
you	1
forget	1
mamma	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
assemblies	1
and	1
that	1
mrs	1
long	1
promised	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
mrs	1
long	1
will	1
do	1
any	1
such	1
thing	1
she	1
has	1
two	1
nieces	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
selfish	1
hypocritical	1
woman	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
opinion	1
of	1
her	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
i	1
said	1
mr	1
bennet	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
depend	1
on	1
her	1
serving	1
you	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
deigned	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
reply	1
but	1
unable	1
to	1
contain	1
herself	1
began	1
scolding	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
don	1
t	1
keep	1
coughing	1
so	1
kitty	1
for	1
heaven	1
s	1
sake	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
compassion	1
on	1
my	1
nerves	1
you	1
tear	1
them	1
to	1
pieces	1
kitty	1
has	1
no	1
discretion	1
in	1
her	1
coughs	1
said	1
her	1
father	1
she	1
times	1
them	1
ill	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
cough	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
amusement	1
replied	1
kitty	1
fretfully	1
when	1
is	1
your	1
next	1
ball	1
to	1
be	1
lizzy	1
to	1
morrow	1
fortnight	1
aye	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
cried	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
mrs	1
long	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
so	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
for	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
know	1
him	1
herself	1
then	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
your	1
friend	1
and	1
introduce	1
mr	1
bingley	1
to	1
her	1
impossible	1
mr	1
bennet	1
impossible	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him	1
myself	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
teasing	1
i	1
honour	1
your	1
circumspection	1
a	1
fortnight	1
s	1
acquaintance	1
is	1
certainly	1
very	1
little	1
one	1
cannot	1
know	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
really	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
fortnight	1
but	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
venture	1
somebody	1
else	1
will	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
mrs	1
long	1
and	1
her	1
nieces	1
must	1
stand	1
their	1
chance	1
and	1
therefore	1
as	1
she	1
will	1
think	1
it	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
kindness	1
if	1
you	1
decline	1
the	1
office	1
i	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
on	1
myself	1
the	1
girls	1
stared	1
at	1
their	1
father	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
said	1
only	1
nonsense	1
nonsense	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
that	1
emphatic	1
exclamation	1
cried	1
he	1
do	1
you	1
consider	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
introduction	1
and	1
the	1
stress	1
that	1
is	1
laid	1
on	1
them	1
as	1
nonsense	1
i	1
cannot	1
quite	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
there	1
what	1
say	1
you	1
mary	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
of	1
deep	1
reflection	1
i	1
know	1
and	1
read	1
great	1
books	1
and	1
make	1
extracts	1
mary	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
sensible	1
but	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
while	1
mary	1
is	1
adjusting	1
her	1
ideas	1
he	1
continued	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
to	1
mr	1
bingley	1
i	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
cried	1
his	1
wife	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
but	1
why	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
before	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
known	1
as	1
much	1
this	1
morning	1
i	1
certainly	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
called	1
on	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
unlucky	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
actually	1
paid	1
the	1
visit	1
we	1
cannot	1
escape	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
now	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
wished	1
that	1
of	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
perhaps	1
surpassing	1
the	1
rest	1
though	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
tumult	1
of	1
joy	1
was	1
over	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
how	1
good	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
mr	1
bennet	1
but	1
i	1
knew	1
i	1
should	1
persuade	1
you	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
was	1
sure	1
you	1
loved	1
your	1
girls	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
neglect	1
such	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
well	1
how	1
pleased	1
i	1
am	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
joke	1
too	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
this	1
morning	1
and	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
it	1
till	1
now	1

kitty	1

may	1
cough	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
choose	1
said	1
mr	1
bennet	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
fatigued	1
with	1
the	1
raptures	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
what	1
an	1
excellent	1
father	1
you	1
have	1
girls	1
said	1
she	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
you	1
will	1
ever	1
make	1
him	1
amends	1
for	1
his	1
kindness	1
or	1
me	1
either	1
for	1
that	1
matter	1
at	1
our	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
pleasant	1
i	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
new	1
acquaintances	1
every	1
day	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
we	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
lydia	1
my	1
love	1
though	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
youngest	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
mr	1
bingley	1
will	1
dance	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
ball	1
oh	1
said	1
lydia	1
stoutly	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
for	1
though	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
youngest	1
i	1
m	1
the	1
tallest	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
conjecturing	1
how	1
soon	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
mr	1
bennet	1
s	1
visit	1
and	1
determining	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
dinner	1
chapter	1
3	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
however	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
her	1
five	1
daughters	1
could	1
ask	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
draw	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
description	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
they	1
attacked	1
him	1
in	1
various	1
ways	1
with	1
barefaced	1
questions	1
ingenious	1
suppositions	1
and	1
distant	1
surmises	1
but	1
he	1
eluded	1
the	1
skill	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
last	1
obliged	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
second	1
hand	1
intelligence	1
of	1
their	1
neighbour	1
lady	1
lucas	1
her	1
report	1
was	1
highly	1
favourable	1
sir	1
william	1
had	1
been	1
delighted	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
young	1
wonderfully	1
handsome	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
and	1
to	1
crown	1
the	1
whole	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
assembly	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
delightful	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
dancing	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
step	1
towards	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
very	1
lively	1
hopes	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
heart	1
were	1
entertained	1
if	1
i	1
can	1
but	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
daughters	1
happily	1
settled	1
at	1
netherfield	1
said	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
equally	1
well	1
married	1
i	1
shall	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
mr	1
bingley	1
returned	1
mr	1
bennet	1
s	1
visit	1
and	1
sat	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
library	1
he	1
had	1
entertained	1
hopes	1
of	1
being	1
admitted	1
to	1
a	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
of	1
whose	1
beauty	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
much	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
only	1
the	1
father	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
somewhat	1
more	1
fortunate	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
ascertaining	1
from	1
an	1
upper	1
window	1
that	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
blue	1
coat	1
and	1
rode	1
a	1
black	1
horse	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
dinner	1
was	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
dispatched	1
and	1
already	1
had	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
planned	1
the	1
courses	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
credit	1
to	1
her	1
housekeeping	1
when	1
an	1
answer	1
arrived	1
which	1
deferred	1
it	1
all	1
mr	1
bingley	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
and	1
consequently	1
unable	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
their	1
invitation	1
etc	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
quite	1
disconcerted	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
business	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
in	1
town	1
so	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
in	1
hertfordshire	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
always	1
flying	1
about	1
from	1
one	1
place	1
to	1
another	1
and	1
never	1
settled	1
at	1
netherfield	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
lady	1
lucas	1
quieted	1
her	1
fears	1
a	1
little	1
by	1
starting	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
gone	1
to	1
london	1
only	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
for	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
a	1
report	1
soon	1
followed	1
that	1
mr	1
bingley	1
was	1
to	1
bring	1
twelve	1
ladies	1
and	1
seven	1
gentlemen	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
assembly	1
the	1
girls	1
grieved	1
over	1
such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
ladies	1
but	1
were	1
comforted	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
ball	1
by	1
hearing	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
twelve	1
he	1
brought	1
only	1
six	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
london	1
his	1
five	1
sisters	1
and	1
a	1
cousin	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
party	1
entered	1
the	1
assembly	1
room	1
it	1
consisted	1
of	1
only	1
five	1
altogether	1
mr	1
bingley	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
and	1
another	1
young	1
man	1
mr	1
bingley	1
was	1
good	1
looking	1
and	1
gentlemanlike	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
countenance	1
and	1
easy	1
unaffected	1
manners	1
his	1
sisters	1
were	1
fine	1
women	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
decided	1
fashion	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
mr	1
hurst	1
merely	1
looked	1
the	1
gentleman	1
but	1
his	1
friend	1
mr	1
darcy	1
soon	1
drew	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
by	1
his	1
fine	1
tall	1
person	1
handsome	1
features	1
noble	1
mien	1
and	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
general	1
circulation	1
within	1
five	1
minutes	1
after	1
his	1
entrance	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
ten	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
pronounced	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
fine	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
the	1
ladies	1
declared	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
handsomer	1
than	1
mr	1
bingley	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
looked	1
at	1
with	1
great	1
admiration	1
for	1
about	1
half	1
the	1
evening	1
till	1
his	1
manners	1
gave	1
a	1
disgust	1
which	1
turned	1
the	1
tide	1
of	1
his	1
popularity	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
discovered	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
to	1
be	1
above	1
his	1
company	1
and	1
above	1
being	1
pleased	1
and	1
not	1
all	1
his	1
large	1
estate	1
in	1
derbyshire	1
could	1
then	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
having	1
a	1
most	1
forbidding	1
disagreeable	1
countenance	1
and	1
being	1
unworthy	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
mr	1
bingley	1
had	1
soon	1
made	1
himself	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
principal	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
lively	1
and	1
unreserved	1
danced	1
every	1
dance	1
was	1
angry	1
that	1
the	1
ball	1
closed	1
so	1
early	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
giving	1
one	1
himself	1
at	1
netherfield	1
such	1
amiable	1
qualities	1
must	1
speak	1
for	1
themselves	1
what	1
a	1
contrast	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
mr	1
darcy	1
danced	1
only	1
once	1
with	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
and	1
once	1
with	1
miss	1
bingley	1
declined	1
being	1
introduced	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
lady	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
in	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
speaking	1
occasionally	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
party	1
his	1
character	1
was	1
decided	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
proudest	1
most	1
disagreeable	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
everybody	1
hoped	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
there	1
again	1
amongst	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
against	1
him	1
was	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
whose	1
dislike	1
of	1
his	1
general	1
behaviour	1
was	1
sharpened	1
into	1
particular	1
resentment	1
by	1
his	1
having	1
slighted	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
elizabeth	1
bennet	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
by	1
the	1
scarcity	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
for	1
two	1
dances	1
and	1
during	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
mr	1
darcy	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
near	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
conversation	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
mr	1
bingley	1
who	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
dance	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
to	1
press	1
his	1
friend	1
to	1
join	1
it	1
come	1
darcy	1
said	1
he	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
you	1
dance	1
i	1
hate	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
standing	1
about	1
by	1
yourself	1
in	1
this	1
stupid	1
manner	1
you	1
had	1
much	1
better	1
dance	1
i	1
certainly	1
shall	1
not	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
i	1
detest	1
it	1
unless	1
i	1
am	1
particularly	1
acquainted	1
with	1
my	1
partner	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
assembly	1
as	1
this	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
insupportable	1
your	1
sisters	1
are	1
engaged	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
another	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
whom	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
punishment	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
with	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
fastidious	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
cried	1
mr	1
bingley	1
for	1
a	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
my	1
honour	1
i	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
pleasant	1
girls	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
this	1
evening	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
you	1
see	1
uncommonly	1
pretty	1
you	1
are	1
dancing	1
with	1
the	1
only	1
handsome	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
said	1
mr	1
darcy	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
eldest	1
miss	1
bennet	1
oh	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
creature	1
i	1
ever	1
beheld	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sisters	1
sitting	1
down	1
just	1
behind	1
you	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
very	1
agreeable	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
ask	1
my	1
partner	1
to	1
introduce	1
you	1
which	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
elizabeth	1
till	1
catching	1
her	1
eye	1
he	1
withdrew	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
coldly	1
said	1
she	1
is	1
tolerable	1
but	1
not	1
handsome	1
enough	1
to	1
tempt	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
no	1
humour	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
give	1
consequence	1
to	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
are	1
slighted	1
by	1
other	1
men	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
partner	1
and	1
enjoy	1
her	1
smiles	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
wasting	1
your	1
time	1
with	1
me	1
mr	1
bingley	1
followed	1
his	1
advice	1
mr	1
darcy	1
walked	1
off	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
remained	1
with	1
no	1
very	1
cordial	1
feelings	1
toward	1
him	1
she	1
told	1
the	1
story	1
however	1
with	1
great	1
spirit	1
among	1
her	1
friends	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
lively	1
playful	1
disposition	1
which	1
delighted	1
in	1
anything	1
ridiculous	1
the	1
evening	1
altogether	1
passed	1
off	1
pleasantly	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
much	1
admired	1
by	1
the	1
netherfield	1
party	1
mr	1
bingley	1
had	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
sisters	1
jane	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
gratified	1
by	1
this	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
could	1
be	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
quieter	1
way	1
elizabeth	1
felt	1
jane	1
s	1
pleasure	1
mary	1
had	1
heard	1
herself	1
mentioned	1
to	1
miss	1
bingley	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
accomplished	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
and	1
catherine	1
and	1
lydia	1
had	1
been	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
without	1
partners	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
yet	1
learnt	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
at	1
a	1
ball	1
they	1
returned	1
therefore	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
to	1
longbourn	1
the	1
village	1
where	1
they	1
lived	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
principal	1
inhabitants	1
they	1
found	1
mr	1
bennet	1
still	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
he	1
was	1
regardless	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
an	1
evening	1
which	1
had	1
raised	1
such	1
splendid	1
expectations	1
he	1
had	1
rather	1
hoped	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
views	1
on	1
the	1
stranger	1
would	1
be	1
disappointed	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
different	1
story	1
to	1
hear	1
oh	1
my	1
dear	1
mr	1
bennet	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
most	1
delightful	1
evening	1
a	1
most	1
excellent	1
ball	1
i	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
jane	1
was	1
so	1
admired	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
like	1
it	1
everybody	1
said	1
how	1
well	1
she	1
looked	1
and	1
mr	1
bingley	1
thought	1
her	1
quite	1
beautiful	1
and	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice	1
only	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
my	1
dear	1
he	1
actually	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
asked	1
miss	1
lucas	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
vexed	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
stand	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
however	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
admire	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
indeed	1
nobody	1
can	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
struck	1
with	1
jane	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
down	1
the	1
dance	1
so	1
he	1
inquired	1
who	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
got	1
introduced	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
next	1
then	1
the	1
two	1
third	1
he	1
danced	1
with	1
miss	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fourth	1
with	1
maria	1
lucas	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fifth	1
with	1
jane	1
again	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sixth	1
with	1
lizzy	1
and	1
the	1
boulanger	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
any	1
compassion	1
for	1
me	1
cried	1
her	1
husband	1
impatiently	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
danced	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
partners	1
oh	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sprained	1
his	1
ankle	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
dance	1
oh	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
am	1
quite	1
delighted	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
excessively	1
handsome	1
and	1
his	1
sisters	1
are	1
charming	1
women	1
i	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
saw	1
anything	1
more	1
elegant	1
than	1
their	1
dresses	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
the	1
lace	1
upon	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
s	1
gown	1
here	1
she	1
was	1
interrupted	1
again	1
mr	1
bennet	1
protested	1
against	1
any	1
description	1
of	1
finery	1
she	1
was	1
therefore	1
obliged	1
to	1
seek	1
another	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
related	1
with	1
much	1
bitterness	1
of	1
spirit	1
and	1
some	1
exaggeration	1
the	1
shocking	1
rudeness	1
of	1
mr	1
darcy	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
that	1
lizzy	1
does	1
not	1
lose	1
much	1
by	1
not	1
suiting	1
his	1
fancy	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
disagreeable	1
horrid	1
man	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
worth	1
pleasing	1
so	1
high	1
and	1
so	1
conceited	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
enduring	1
him	1
he	1
walked	1
here	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
there	1
fancying	1
himself	1
so	1
very	1
great	1
not	1
handsome	1
enough	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
i	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
my	1
dear	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
set	1
downs	1
i	1
quite	1
detest	1
the	1
man	1
chapter	1
4	1
when	1
jane	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
were	1
alone	1
the	1
former	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
cautious	1
in	1
her	1
praise	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
before	1
expressed	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
just	1
how	1
very	1
much	1
she	1
admired	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
she	1
sensible	1
good	1
humoured	1
lively	1
and	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
happy	1
manners	1
so	1
much	1
ease	1
with	1
such	1
perfect	1
good	1
breeding	1
he	1
is	1
also	1
handsome	1
replied	1
elizabeth	1
which	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
ought	1
likewise	1
to	1
be	1
if	1
he	1
possibly	1
can	1
his	1
character	1
is	1
thereby	1
complete	1
i	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
asking	1
me	1
to	1
dance	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
such	1
a	1
compliment	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
i	1
did	1
for	1
you	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
one	1
great	1
difference	1
between	1
us	1
compliments	1
always	1
take	1
you	1
by	1
surprise	1
and	1
me	1
never	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
than	1
his	1
asking	1
you	1
again	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
times	1
as	1
pretty	1
as	1
every	1
other	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
no	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
gallantry	1
for	1
that	1
well	1
he	1
certainly	1
is	1
very	1
agreeable	1
and	1
i	1
give	1
you	1
leave	1
to	1
like	1
him	1
you	1
have	1
liked	1
many	1
a	1
stupider	1
person	1
dear	1
lizzy	1
oh	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
apt	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
like	1
people	1
in	1
general	1
you	1
never	1
see	1
a	1
fault	1
in	1
anybody	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
agreeable	1
in	1
your	1
eyes	1
i	1
never	1
heard	1
you	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
in	1
your	1
life	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
hasty	1
in	1
censuring	1
anyone	1
but	1
i	1
always	1
speak	1
what	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
do	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
wonder	1
with	1
your	1
good	1
sense	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
honestly	1
blind	1
to	1
the	1
follies	1
and	1
nonsense	1
of	1
others	1
affectation	1
of	1
candour	1
is	1
common	1
enough	1
one	1
meets	1
with	1
it	1
everywhere	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
candid	1
without	1
ostentation	1
or	1
design	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
everybody	1
s	1
character	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
still	1
better	1
and	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
bad	1
belongs	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
like	1
this	1
man	1
s	1
sisters	1
too	1
do	1
you	1
their	1
manners	1
are	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
his	1
certainly	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
pleasing	1
women	1
when	1
you	1
converse	1
with	1
them	1
miss	1
bingley	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
very	1
charming	1
neighbour	1
in	1
her	1
elizabeth	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
convinced	1
their	1
behaviour	1
at	1
the	1
assembly	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
calculated	1
to	1
please	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
with	1
more	1
quickness	1
of	1
observation	1
and	1
less	1
pliancy	1
of	1
temper	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
judgement	1
too	1
unassailed	1
by	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
disposed	1
to	1
approve	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
fact	1
very	1
fine	1
ladies	1
not	1
deficient	1
in	1
good	1
humour	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
pleased	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
themselves	1
agreeable	1
when	1
they	1
chose	1
it	1
but	1
proud	1
and	1
conceited	1
they	1
were	1
rather	1
handsome	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1

a	1

of	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
spending	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
ought	1
and	1
of	1
associating	1
with	1
people	1
of	1
rank	1
and	1
were	1
therefore	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
entitled	1
to	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
themselves	1
and	1
meanly	1
of	1
others	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
respectable	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
england	1
a	1
circumstance	1
more	1
deeply	1
impressed	1
on	1
their	1
memories	1
than	1
that	1
their	1
brother	1

fortune	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
had	1
been	1
acquired	1
by	1
trade	1
mr	1

property	1
to	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
nearly	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
who	1
had	1
intended	1
to	1
purchase	1
an	1
estate	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
live	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
mr	1
bingley	1
intended	1
it	1
likewise	1
and	1
sometimes	1
made	1
choice	1
of	1
his	1
county	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
provided	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
a	1
manor	1
it	1
was	1
doubtful	1
to	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
best	1
knew	1
the	1
easiness	1
of	1
his	1
temper	1
whether	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
spend	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
days	1
at	1
netherfield	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
next	1
generation	1
to	1
purchase	1
his	1

were	1
anxious	1
for	1
his	1
having	1
an	1
estate	1
of	1

own	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
only	1
established	1
as	1
a	1
tenant	1
miss	1
bingley	1
was	1
by	1
no	1

unwilling	1
to	1
preside	1
at	1
his	1
table	1
nor	1
was	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
who	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
more	1
fashion	1
than	1
fortune	1

disposed	1
to	1
consider	1
his	1
house	1
as	1

when	1
it	1
suited	1
her	1
mr	1
bingley	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
of	1
age	1
two	1
years	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
tempted	1
by	1
an	1
accidental	1
recommendation	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
netherfield	1
house	1
he	1
did	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
into	1
it	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
situation	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
rooms	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
the	1
owner	1
said	1
in	1
its	1
praise	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
immediately	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
darcy	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
steady	1
friendship	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
great	1
opposition	1
of	1
character	1
bingley	1
was	1
endeared	1
to	1
darcy	1
by	1
the	1
easiness	1
openness	1
and	1
ductility	1
of	1
his	1
temper	1
though	1
no	1
disposition	1
could	1
offer	1
a	1
greater	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
though	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
never	1
appeared	1
dissatisfied	1
on	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
darcy	1

regard	1
bingley	1
had	1
the	1
firmest	1
reliance	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
judgement	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
in	1
understanding	1
darcy	1
was	1
the	1
superior	1
bingley	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
deficient	1
but	1
darcy	1
was	1
clever	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
haughty	1
reserved	1
and	1
fastidious	1
and	1
his	1
manners	1
though	1
well	1
bred	1
were	1
not	1
inviting	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
his	1
friend	1
had	1
greatly	1
the	1
advantage	1
bingley	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
liked	1
wherever	1
he	1
appeared	1
darcy	1
was	1
continually	1
giving	1
offense	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
meryton	1
assembly	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
characteristic	1
bingley	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
more	1
pleasant	1
people	1
or	1
prettier	1
girls	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
everybody	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
kind	1
and	1
attentive	1
to	1
him	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
formality	1
no	1
stiffness	1
he	1
had	1
soon	1
felt	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
miss	1
bennet	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
an	1
angel	1
more	1
beautiful	1
darcy	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
people	1
in	1
whom	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
beauty	1
and	1
no	1
fashion	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
smallest	1
interest	1
and	1
from	1
none	1
received	1
either	1
attention	1
or	1
pleasure	1
miss	1
bennet	1
he	1
acknowledged	1
to	1
be	1
pretty	1
but	1
she	1
smiled	1
too	1
much	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
allowed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
but	1
still	1
they	1
admired	1
her	1
and	1
liked	1
her	1
and	1
pronounced	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sweet	1
girl	1
and	1
one	1
whom	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
know	1
more	1
of	1
miss	1
bennet	1
was	1
therefore	1
established	1
as	1
a	1
sweet	1
girl	1
and	1
their	1
brother	1
felt	1
authorized	1
by	1
such	1
commendation	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
chose	1

within	1
a	1
short	1
walk	1
of	1

been	1
formerly	1
in	1
trade	1
in	1
meryton	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
tolerable	1
fortune	1
and	1
risen	1
to	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
knighthood	1
by	1
an	1
address	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
during	1
his	1
mayoralty	1
the	1
distinction	1
had	1
perhaps	1
been	1
felt	1
too	1
strongly	1
it	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
disgust	1
to	1
his	1
business	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
residence	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
market	1
town	1
and	1
in	1
quitting	1
them	1
both	1
he	1
had	1
removed	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
to	1
a	1
house	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
meryton	1
denominated	1
from	1
that	1
period	1
lucas	1
lodge	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
with	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
importance	1
and	1
unshackled	1
by	1
business	1
occupy	1
himself	1
solely	1
in	1
being	1
civil	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
though	1
elated	1
by	1
his	1
rank	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
render	1
him	1
supercilious	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
was	1
all	1

to	1
everybody	1
by	1
nature	1
inoffensive	1
friendly	1
and	1
obliging	1

a	1

should	1
meet	1
to	1
talk	1
over	1
a	1
ball	1

absolutely	1

and	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1

to	1

seemed	1
to	1
like	1

better	1
oh	1
you	1

because	1

danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
did	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
admired	1
her	1
indeed	1
i	1
rather	1
believe	1
he	1
did	1
i	1
heard	1
something	1
about	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
hardly	1
know	1
what	1
something	1
about	1
mr	1
robinson	1
perhaps	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
i	1
overheard	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
mr	1
robinson	1
did	1
not	1
i	1
mention	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
mr	1
robinson	1
s	1
asking	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
liked	1
our	1
meryton	1
assemblies	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
pretty	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
prettiest	1
and	1
his	1
answering	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
question	1
oh	1
the	1
eldest	1
miss	1
bennet	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
two	1
opinions	1
on	1
that	1
point	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
well	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
decided	1
indeed	1
that	1
does	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
but	1
however	1
it	1
may	1
all	1
come	1
to	1
nothing	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
overhearings	1
were	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
than	1
yours	1
eliza	1
said	1
charlotte	1
mr	1
darcy	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
well	1
worth	1
listening	1
to	1
as	1
his	1
friend	1
is	1
he	1
poor	1
eliza	1
to	1
be	1
only	1
just	1
tolerable	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
lizzy	1
s	1
head	1
to	1
be	1
vexed	1
by	1
his	1
ill	1
treatment	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
man	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
misfortune	1
to	1
be	1
liked	1
by	1
him	1
mrs	1
long	1
told	1
me	1
last	1
night	1
that	1
he	1
sat	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
without	1
once	1
opening	1
his	1
lips	1
are	1
you	1
quite	1
sure	1
ma	1
am	1
is	1
not	1
there	1
a	1
little	1
mistake	1
said	1
jane	1
i	1
certainly	1
saw	1
mr	1
darcy	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
aye	1
because	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
at	1
last	1
how	1
he	1
liked	1
netherfield	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
answering	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
angry	1
at	1
being	1
spoke	1
to	1
miss	1
bingley	1
told	1
me	1
said	1
jane	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
speaks	1
much	1
unless	1
among	1
his	1
intimate	1
acquaintances	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
is	1
remarkably	1
agreeable	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it	1
my	1
dear	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
very	1
agreeable	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
talked	1
to	1
mrs	1
long	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
guess	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
everybody	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
eat	1
up	1
with	1
pride	1
and	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
somehow	1
that	1
mrs	1
long	1
does	1
not	1
keep	1
a	1
carriage	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
a	1
hack	1
chaise	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
mind	1
his	1
not	1
talking	1
to	1
mrs	1
long	1
said	1
miss	1
lucas	1
but	1
i	1
wish	1
he	1
had	1
danced	1
with	1
eliza	1
another	1
time	1
lizzy	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
dance	1
with	1
him	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
you	1
i	1
believe	1
ma	1
am	1
i	1
may	1
safely	1
promise	1
you	1
never	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
him	1
his	1
pride	1
said	1
miss	1
lucas	1
does	1
not	1
offend	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
pride	1
often	1
does	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
it	1
one	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
that	1
so	1
very	1
fine	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
family	1
fortune	1
everything	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
should	1
think	1
highly	1
of	1
himself	1
if	1
i	1
may	1
so	1
express	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
true	1
replied	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
easily	1
forgive	1
his	1
pride	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
mortified	1
mine	1
pride	1
observed	1
mary	1
who	1
piqued	1
herself	1
upon	1
the	1
solidity	1
of	1
her	1
reflections	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
common	1
failing	1
i	1
believe	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
read	1
i	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
common	1
indeed	1
that	1
human	1
nature	1
is	1
particularly	1
prone	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
cherish	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
self	1
complacency	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
some	1
quality	1
or	1
other	1
real	1
or	1
imaginary	1
vanity	1
and	1
pride	1
are	1
different	1
things	1
though	1
the	1
words	1
are	1
often	1
used	1
synonymously	1
a	1
person	1
may	1
be	1
proud	1
without	1
being	1
vain	1
pride	1
relates	1
more	1
to	1
our	1
opinion	1
of	1
ourselves	1
vanity	1
to	1
what	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
others	1
think	1
of	1
us	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
mr	1
darcy	1
cried	1
a	1
young	1
lucas	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
sisters	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
care	1
how	1
proud	1
i	1
was	1
i	1
would	1
keep	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
foxhounds	1
and	1
drink	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
a	1
day	1
then	1
you	1
would	1
drink	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
ought	1
said	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
at	1
it	1
i	1
should	1
take	1
away	1
your	1
bottle	1
directly	1
the	1
boy	1
protested	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
she	1
continued	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
and	1
the	1
argument	1
ended	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
visit	1
chapter	1
6	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
longbourn	1
soon	1
waited	1
on	1
those	1
of	1
netherfield	1
the	1
visit	1
was	1
soon	1
returned	1
in	1
due	1
form	1
miss	1
bennet	1
s	1
pleasing	1
manners	1
grew	1
on	1
the	1
goodwill	1
of	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
and	1
miss	1
bingley	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
mother	1
was	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
intolerable	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
sisters	1
not	1
worth	1
speaking	1
to	1
a	1
wish	1
of	1
being	1
better	1
acquainted	1
with	1
them	1
was	1
expressed	1
towards	1
the	1
two	1
eldest	1
by	1
jane	1
this	1
attention	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
but	1
elizabeth	1
still	1
saw	1
superciliousness	1
in	1
their	1
treatment	1
of	1
everybody	1
hardly	1
excepting	1
even	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
like	1
them	1
though	1
their	1
kindness	1
to	1
jane	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
had	1
a	1
value	1
as	1
arising	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
admiration	1
it	1
was	1
generally	1
evident	1
whenever	1
they	1
met	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
admire	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
equally	1
evident	1
that	1
jane	1
was	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
preference	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
entertain	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
but	1
she	1
considered	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
discovered	1
by	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
general	1
since	1
jane	1
united	1
with	1
great	1
strength	1
of	1
feeling	1
a	1
composure	1
of	1
temper	1
and	1
a	1
uniform	1
cheerfulness	1
of	1
manner	1
which	1
would	1
guard	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
suspicions	1
of	1
the	1
impertinent	1
she	1
mentioned	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
miss	1
lucas	1
it	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
pleasant	1
replied	1
charlotte	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
public	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
sometimes	1
a	1
disadvantage	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
guarded	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
conceals	1
her	1
affection	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
skill	1
from	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
may	1
lose	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
fixing	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
but	1
poor	1
consolation	1
to	1
believe	1
the	1
world	1
equally	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
there	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
gratitude	1
or	1
vanity	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
attachment	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
safe	1
to	1
leave	1
any	1
to	1
itself	1
we	1
can	1
all	1
begin	1
freely	1
a	1
slight	1
preference	1
is	1
natural	1
enough	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
have	1
heart	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
really	1
in	1
love	1
without	1
encouragement	1
in	1
nine	1
cases	1
out	1
of	1
ten	1
a	1
woman	1
had	1
better	1
show	1
more	1
affection	1
than	1
she	1
feels	1
bingley	1
likes	1
your	1
sister	1
undoubtedly	1
but	1
he	1
may	1
never	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
like	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
help	1
him	1
on	1
but	1
she	1
does	1
help	1
him	1
on	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
her	1
nature	1
will	1
allow	1
if	1
i	1
can	1
perceive	1
her	1
regard	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
simpleton	1
indeed	1
not	1
to	1
discover	1
it	1
too	1
remember	1
eliza	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
jane	1
s	1
disposition	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
is	1
partial	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
endeavour	1
to	1
conceal	1
it	1
he	1
must	1
find	1
it	1
out	1
perhaps	1
he	1
must	1
if	1
he	1
sees	1
enough	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
though	1
bingley	1
and	1
jane	1
meet	1
tolerably	1
often	1
it	1
is	1
never	1
for	1
many	1
hours	1
together	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
large	1
mixed	1
parties	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
every	1
moment	1
should	1
be	1
employed	1
in	1
conversing	1
together	1
jane	1
should	1
therefore	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
every	1
half	1
hour	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
can	1
command	1
his	1
attention	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
secure	1
of	1
him	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
leisure	1
for	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
chooses	1
your	1
plan	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
one	1
replied	1
elizabeth	1
where	1
nothing	1
is	1
in	1
question	1
but	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
being	1
well	1
married	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
determined	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
rich	1
husband	1
or	1
any	1
husband	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
i	1
should	1
adopt	1
it	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
jane	1
s	1
feelings	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
acting	1
by	1
design	1
as	1
yet	1
she	1
cannot	1
even	1
be	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
regard	1
nor	1
of	1
its	1
reasonableness	1
she	1
has	1
known	1
him	1
only	1
a	1
fortnight	1
she	1
danced	1
four	1
dances	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
meryton	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
one	1
morning	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
and	1
has	1
since	1
dined	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
company	1
four	1
times	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
understand	1
his	1
character	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
represent	1
it	1
had	1
she	1
merely	1
dined	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
might	1
only	1
have	1
discovered	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
appetite	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
remember	1
that	1
four	1
evenings	1
have	1
also	1
been	1
spent	1
together	1
and	1
four	1
evenings	1
may	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
yes	1
these	1
four	1
evenings	1
have	1
enabled	1
them	1
to	1
ascertain	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
like	1
vingt	1
un	1
better	1
than	1
commerce	1
but	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
leading	1
characteristic	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
that	1
much	1
has	1
been	1
unfolded	1
well	1
said	1
charlotte	1
i	1
wish	1
jane	1
success	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
married	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
morrow	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
she	1
had	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
happiness	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
studying	1
his	1
character	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
happiness	1
in	1
marriage	1
is	1
entirely	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
chance	1
if	1
the	1
dispositions	1
of	1
the	1
parties	1
are	1
ever	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
or	1
ever	1
so	1
similar	1
beforehand	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
advance	1
their	1
felicity	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
they	1
always	1
continue	1
to	1
grow	1
sufficiently	1
unlike	1
afterwards	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
vexation	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
know	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
of	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
with	1
whom	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
pass	1
your	1
life	1
you	1
make	1
me	1
laugh	1
charlotte	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
sound	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
sound	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
act	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
yourself	1
occupied	1
in	1
observing	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
attentions	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
suspecting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
becoming	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
some	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
mr	1
darcy	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
scarcely	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
pretty	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
without	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
next	1
met	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
only	1
to	1
criticise	1
but	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
that	1
she	1
hardly	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
feature	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
than	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
was	1
rendered	1
uncommonly	1
intelligent	1
by	1
the	1
beautiful	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
dark	1
eyes	1
to	1
this	1
discovery	1
succeeded	1
some	1
others	1
equally	1
mortifying	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
detected	1
with	1
a	1
critical	1
eye	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
failure	1
of	1
perfect	1
symmetry	1
in	1
her	1
form	1
he	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
her	1
figure	1
to	1
be	1
light	1
and	1
pleasing	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
asserting	1
that	1
her	1
manners	1
were	1
not	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
fashionable	1
world	1
he	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
their	1
easy	1
playfulness	1
of	1
this	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
unaware	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
made	1
himself	1
agreeable	1
nowhere	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
her	1
handsome	1
enough	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
step	1
towards	1
conversing	1
with	1
her	1
himself	1
attended	1
to	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
others	1
his	1
doing	1
so	1
drew	1
her	1
notice	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
sir	1
william	1
lucas	1
s	1
where	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
were	1
assembled	1
what	1
does	1
mr	1
darcy	1
mean	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
charlotte	1
by	1
listening	1
to	1
my	1
conversation	1
with	1
colonel	1
forster	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
mr	1
darcy	1
only	1
can	1
answer	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
it	1
any	1
more	1
i	1
shall	1
certainly	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
satirical	1
eye	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
begin	1
by	1
being	1
impertinent	1
myself	1
i	1
shall	1
soon	1
grow	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
approaching	1
them	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
though	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
speaking	1
miss	1
lucas	1
defied	1
her	1
friend	1
to	1
mention	1
such	1
a	1
subject	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
immediately	1
provoking	1
elizabeth	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
mr	1
darcy	1
that	1
i	1
expressed	1
myself	1
uncommonly	1
well	1
just	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
teasing	1
colonel	1
forster	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
ball	1
at	1
meryton	1
with	1
great	1
energy	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
makes	1
a	1
lady	1
energetic	1
you	1
are	1
severe	1
on	1
us	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
her	1
turn	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
teased	1
said	1
miss	1
lucas	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
instrument	1
eliza	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
follows	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
creature	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
always	1
wanting	1
me	1
to	1
play	1
and	1
sing	1
before	1
anybody	1
and	1
everybody	1
if	1
my	1
vanity	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
musical	1
turn	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
invaluable	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
would	1
really	1
rather	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
before	1
those	1
who	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
hearing	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
performers	1
on	1
miss	1
lucas	1
s	1
persevering	1
however	1
she	1
added	1
very	1
well	1
if	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
and	1
gravely	1
glancing	1
at	1
mr	1
darcy	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
old	1
saying	1
which	1
everybody	1
here	1
is	1
of	1
course	1
familiar	1
with	1
keep	1
your	1
breath	1
to	1
cool	1
your	1
porridge	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
keep	1
mine	1
to	1
swell	1
my	1
song	1
her	1
performance	1
was	1
pleasing	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
capital	1
after	1
a	1
song	1
or	1
two	1
and	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
entreaties	1
of	1
several	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
sing	1
again	1
she	1
was	1
eagerly	1
succeeded	1
at	1
the	1
instrument	1
by	1
her	1
sister	1
mary	1
who	1
having	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
only	1
plain	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
worked	1
hard	1
for	1
knowledge	1
and	1
accomplishments	1
was	1
always	1
impatient	1
for	1
display	1
mary	1
had	1
neither	1
genius	1
nor	1
taste	1
and	1
though	1
vanity	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
application	1
it	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
likewise	1
a	1
pedantic	1
air	1
and	1
conceited	1
manner	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
injured	1
a	1
higher	1
degree	1
of	1
excellence	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
reached	1
elizabeth	1
easy	1
and	1
unaffected	1
had	1
been	1
listened	1
to	1
with	1
much	1
more	1
pleasure	1
though	1
not	1
playing	1
half	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
mary	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
concerto	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
purchase	1
praise	1
and	1
gratitude	1
by	1
scotch	1
and	1
irish	1
airs	1
at	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
her	1
younger	1
sisters	1
who	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
lucases	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
officers	1
joined	1
eagerly	1
in	1
dancing	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
mr	1
darcy	1
stood	1
near	1
them	1
in	1
silent	1
indignation	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
mode	1
of	1
passing	1
the	1
evening	1
to	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
all	1
conversation	1
and	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
engrossed	1
by	1
his	1
thoughts	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
sir	1
william	1
lucas	1
was	1
his	1
neighbour	1
till	1
sir	1
william	1
thus	1
began	1
what	1
a	1
charming	1
amusement	1
for	1
young	1
people	1
this	1
is	1
mr	1
darcy	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
like	1
dancing	1
after	1
all	1
i	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
refinements	1
of	1
polished	1
society	1
certainly	1
sir	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
the	1
advantage	1
also	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
vogue	1
amongst	1
the	1
less	1
polished	1
societies	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
every	1
savage	1
can	1
dance	1
sir	1
william	1
only	1
smiled	1
your	1
friend	1
performs	1
delightfully	1
he	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
on	1
seeing	1
bingley	1
join	1
the	1
group	1
and	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
adept	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
yourself	1
mr	1
darcy	1
you	1
saw	1
me	1
dance	1
at	1
meryton	1
i	1
believe	1
sir	1
yes	1
indeed	1
and	1
received	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
pleasure	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
do	1
you	1
often	1
dance	1
at	1
st	1
james	1
s	1
never	1
sir	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
proper	1
compliment	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
compliment	1
which	1
i	1
never	1
pay	1
to	1
any	1
place	1
if	1
i	1
can	1
avoid	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
town	1
i	1
conclude	1
mr	1
darcy	1
bowed	1
i	1
had	1
once	1
had	1
some	1
thought	1
of	1
fixing	1
in	1
town	1
myself	1
for	1
i	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
superior	1
society	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
london	1
would	1
agree	1
with	1
lady	1
lucas	1
he	1
paused	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
an	1
answer	1
but	1
his	1
companion	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
moving	1
towards	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
doing	1
a	1
very	1
gallant	1
thing	1
and	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
my	1
dear	1
miss	1
eliza	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
dancing	1
mr	1
darcy	1
you	1
must	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
present	1
this	1
young	1
lady	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
desirable	1
partner	1
you	1
cannot	1
refuse	1
to	1
dance	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
when	1
so	1
much	1
beauty	1
is	1
before	1
you	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
mr	1
darcy	1
who	1
though	1
extremely	1
surprised	1
was	1
not	1
unwilling	1
to	1
receive	1
it	1
when	1
she	1
instantly	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
some	1
discomposure	1
to	1
sir	1
william	1
indeed	1
sir	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
intention	1
of	1
dancing	1
i	1
entreat	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
i	1
moved	1
this	1
way	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
beg	1
for	1
a	1
partner	1
mr	1
darcy	1
with	1
grave	1
propriety	1
requested	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
determined	1
nor	1
did	1
sir	1
william	1
at	1
all	1
shake	1
her	1
purpose	1
by	1
his	1
attempt	1
at	1
persuasion	1
you	1
excel	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
dance	1
miss	1
eliza	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
cruel	1
to	1
deny	1
me	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
gentleman	1
dislikes	1
the	1
amusement	1
in	1
general	1
he	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
to	1
oblige	1
us	1
for	1
one	1
half	1
hour	1
mr	1
darcy	1
is	1
all	1
politeness	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
smiling	1
he	1
is	1
indeed	1
but	1
considering	1
the	1
inducement	1
my	1
dear	1
miss	1
eliza	1
we	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
at	1
his	1
complaisance	1
for	1
who	1
would	1
object	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
partner	1
elizabeth	1
looked	1
archly	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
her	1
resistance	1
had	1
not	1
injured	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
gentleman	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
some	1
complacency	1
when	1
thus	1
accosted	1
by	1
miss	1
bingley	1
i	1
can	1
guess	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
your	1
reverie	1
i	1
should	1
imagine	1
not	1
you	1
are	1
considering	1
how	1
insupportable	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
pass	1
many	1
evenings	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
in	1
such	1
society	1
and	1
indeed	1
i	1
am	1
quite	1
of	1
your	1
opinion	1
i	1
was	1
never	1
more	1
annoyed	1
the	1
insipidity	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
noise	1
the	1
nothingness	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
self	1
importance	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
people	1
what	1
would	1
i	1
give	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
strictures	1
on	1
them	1
your	1
conjecture	1
is	1
totally	1
wrong	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
more	1
agreeably	1
engaged	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
meditating	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
pleasure	1
which	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
fine	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
can	1
bestow	1
miss	1
bingley	1
immediately	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
desired	1
he	1
would	1
tell	1
her	1
what	1
lady	1
had	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
inspiring	1
such	1
reflections	1
mr	1
darcy	1
replied	1
with	1
great	1
intrepidity	1
miss	1
elizabeth	1

miss	1
elizabeth	1

repeated	1
miss	1
bingley	1
i	1
am	1
all	1
astonishment	1
how	1
long	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
favourite	1
and	1
pray	1
when	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
wish	1
you	1
joy	1
that	1
is	1
exactly	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
i	1
expected	1
you	1
to	1
ask	1
a	1
lady	1
s	1
imagination	1
is	1
very	1
rapid	1
it	1
jumps	1
from	1
admiration	1
to	1
love	1
from	1
love	1
to	1
matrimony	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
i	1
knew	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
wishing	1
me	1
joy	1
nay	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
serious	1
about	1
it	1
i	1
shall	1
consider	1
the	1
matter	1

absolutely	1
settled	1
you	1

a	1
charming	1

of	1

she	1
will	1
always	1
be	1

he	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
while	1
she	1
chose	1
to	1
entertain	1
herself	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1

and	1
however	1
bare	1
of	1
news	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
general	1
might	1
be	1
they	1
always	1
contrived	1
to	1
learn	1
some	1
from	1
their	1
aunt	1
at	1
present	1
indeed	1
they	1
were	1
well	1
supplied	1
both	1
with	1
news	1
and	1
happiness	1
by	1
the	1
recent	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
militia	1
regiment	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
remain	1
the	1
whole	1
winter	1
and	1
meryton	1
was	1
the	1
headquarters	1
their	1
visits	1
to	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
were	1
now	1
productive	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
intelligence	1
every	1
day	1
added	1
something	1
to	1
their	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
names	1
and	1
connections	1
their	1
lodgings	1
were	1
not	1
long	1
a	1
secret	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
officers	1
themselves	1
mr	1
phillips	1
visited	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
this	1
opened	1
to	1
his	1
nieces	1
a	1
store	1
of	1
felicity	1
unknown	1
before	1
they	1
could	1
talk	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
officers	1
and	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
large	1
fortune	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
which	1
gave	1
animation	1
to	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
worthless	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
when	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
regimentals	1
of	1
an	1
ensign	1
after	1
listening	1
one	1
morning	1
to	1
their	1
effusions	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
mr	1
bennet	1
coolly	1
observed	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
collect	1
by	1
your	1
manner	1
of	1
talking	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
silliest	1
girls	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
i	1
have	1
suspected	1
it	1
some	1
time	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
convinced	1
catherine	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
lydia	1
with	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
continued	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
admiration	1
of	1
captain	1
carter	1
and	1
her	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
london	1
i	1
am	1
astonished	1
my	1
dear	1
said	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
think	1
your	1
own	1
children	1
silly	1
if	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
think	1
slightingly	1
of	1
anybody	1
s	1
children	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
however	1
if	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
silly	1
i	1
must	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
sensible	1
of	1
it	1
yes	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
happens	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
very	1
clever	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
point	1
i	1
flatter	1
myself	1
on	1
which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
agree	1
i	1
had	1
hoped	1
that	1
our	1
sentiments	1
coincided	1
in	1
every	1
particular	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
so	1
far	1
differ	1
from	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
think	1
our	1
two	1
youngest	1
daughters	1
uncommonly	1
foolish	1
my	1
dear	1
mr	1
bennet	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
such	1
girls	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
when	1
they	1
get	1
to	1
our	1
age	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
about	1
officers	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
do	1
i	1
remember	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
i	1
liked	1
a	1
red	1
coat	1
myself	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
indeed	1
so	1
i	1
do	1
still	1
at	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
smart	1
young	1
colonel	1
with	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
should	1
want	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
girls	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
say	1
nay	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
i	1
thought	1
colonel	1
forster	1
looked	1
very	1
becoming	1
the	1
other	1
night	1
at	1
sir	1
william	1
s	1
in	1
his	1
regimentals	1
mamma	1
cried	1
lydia	1
my	1
aunt	1
says	1
that	1
colonel	1
forster	1
and	1
captain	1
carter	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
so	1
often	1
to	1
miss	1
watson	1
s	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
when	1
they	1
first	1
came	1
she	1
sees	1
them	1
now	1
very	1
often	1
standing	1
in	1
clarke	1
s	1
library	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
prevented	1
replying	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
footman	1
with	1
a	1
note	1
for	1
miss	1
bennet	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
netherfield	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
waited	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
s	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
eagerly	1
calling	1
out	1
while	1
her	1
daughter	1
read	1
well	1
jane	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
about	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
say	1
well	1
jane	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
tell	1
us	1
make	1
haste	1
my	1
love	1
it	1
is	1
from	1
miss	1
bingley	1
said	1
jane	1
and	1
then	1
read	1
it	1
aloud	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
compassionate	1
as	1
to	1
dine	1
to	1
day	1
with	1
louisa	1
and	1
me	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
hating	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
our	1
lives	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
s	1
tête	1
à	1
tête	1
between	1
two	1
women	1
can	1
never	1
end	1
without	1
a	1
quarrel	1
come	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
on	1
receipt	1
of	1
this	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
yours	1
ever	1
caroline	1
bingley	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
cried	1
lydia	1
i	1
wonder	1
my	1
aunt	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
us	1
of	1
that	1
dining	1
out	1
said	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
unlucky	1
can	1
i	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
said	1
jane	1
no	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
on	1
horseback	1
because	1
it	1
seems	1
likely	1
to	1
rain	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
must	1
stay	1
all	1
night	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
scheme	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
sure	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
offer	1
to	1
send	1
her	1
home	1
oh	1
but	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
will	1
have	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
chaise	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
meryton	1
and	1
the	1
hursts	1
have	1
no	1
horses	1
to	1
theirs	1
i	1
had	1
much	1
rather	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
your	1
father	1
cannot	1
spare	1
the	1
horses	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
they	1
are	1
wanted	1
in	1
the	1
farm	1
mr	1
bennet	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
they	1
are	1
wanted	1
in	1
the	1
farm	1
much	1
oftener	1
than	1
i	1
can	1
get	1
them	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
them	1
to	1
day	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
my	1
mother	1
s	1
purpose	1
will	1
be	1
answered	1
she	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
extort	1
from	1
her	1
father	1
an	1
acknowledgment	1
that	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
engaged	1
jane	1
was	1
therefore	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
attended	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
many	1
cheerful	1
prognostics	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
day	1
her	1
hopes	1
were	1
answered	1
jane	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
gone	1
long	1
before	1
it	1
rained	1
hard	1
her	1
sisters	1
were	1
uneasy	1
for	1
her	1
but	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
delighted	1
the	1
rain	1
continued	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
without	1
intermission	1
jane	1
certainly	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
lucky	1
idea	1
of	1
mine	1
indeed	1
said	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
making	1
it	1
rain	1
were	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
till	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
however	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
felicity	1
of	1
her	1
contrivance	1
breakfast	1
was	1
scarcely	1
over	1
when	1
a	1
servant	1
from	1
netherfield	1
brought	1
the	1
following	1
note	1
for	1
elizabeth	1
my	1
dearest	1
lizzy	1
i	1
find	1
myself	1
very	1
unwell	1
this	1
morning	1
which	1
i	1
suppose	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
imputed	1
to	1
my	1
getting	1
wet	1
through	1
yesterday	1
my	1
kind	1
friends	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
my	1
returning	1
till	1
i	1
am	1
better	1
they	1
insist	1
also	1
on	1
my	1
seeing	1
mr	1
jones	1
therefore	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
alarmed	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
hear	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
excepting	1
a	1
sore	1
throat	1
and	1
headache	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
yours	1
etc	1
well	1
my	1
dear	1
said	1
mr	1
bennet	1
when	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
note	1
aloud	1
if	1
your	1
daughter	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
dangerous	1
fit	1
of	1
illness	1
if	1
she	1
should	1
die	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
and	1
under	1
your	1
orders	1
oh	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
dying	1
people	1
do	1
not	1
die	1
of	1
little	1
trifling	1
colds	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
good	1
care	1
of	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
stays	1
there	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
i	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
elizabeth	1
feeling	1
really	1
anxious	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
though	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
horsewoman	1
walking	1
was	1
her	1
only	1
alternative	1
she	1
declared	1
her	1
resolution	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
silly	1
cried	1
her	1
mother	1
as	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
dirt	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
when	1
you	1
get	1
there	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
fit	1
to	1
see	1
jane	1
which	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
want	1
is	1
this	1
a	1
hint	1
to	1
me	1
lizzy	1
said	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
no	1
indeed	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
walk	1
the	1
distance	1
is	1
nothing	1
when	1
one	1
has	1
a	1
motive	1
only	1
three	1
miles	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
back	1
by	1
dinner	1
i	1
admire	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
your	1
benevolence	1
observed	1
mary	1
but	1
every	1
impulse	1
of	1
feeling	1
should	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
reason	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
exertion	1
should	1
always	1
be	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
required	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
meryton	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
catherine	1
and	1
lydia	1
elizabeth	1
accepted	1
their	1
company	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
set	1
off	1
together	1
if	1
we	1
make	1
haste	1
said	1
lydia	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
along	1
perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
something	1
of	1
captain	1
carter	1
before	1
he	1
goes	1
in	1
meryton	1
they	1
parted	1
the	1
two	1
youngest	1
repaired	1
to	1
the	1
lodgings	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
wives	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
continued	1
her	1
walk	1
alone	1
crossing	1
field	1
after	1
field	1
at	1
a	1
quick	1
pace	1
jumping	1
over	1
stiles	1
and	1
springing	1
over	1
puddles	1
with	1
impatient	1
activity	1
and	1
finding	1
herself	1
at	1
last	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
weary	1
ankles	1
dirty	1
stockings	1
and	1
a	1
face	1
glowing	1
with	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
exercise	1
she	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast	1
parlour	1
where	1
all	1
but	1
jane	1
were	1
assembled	1
and	1
where	1
her	1
appearance	1
created	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
surprise	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
walked	1
three	1
miles	1
so	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
such	1
dirty	1
weather	1
and	1
by	1
herself	1
was	1
almost	1
incredible	1
to	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
and	1
miss	1
bingley	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
held	1
her	1
in	1
contempt	1
for	1
it	1
she	1
was	1
received	1
however	1
very	1
politely	1
by	1
them	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
manners	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
better	1
than	1
politeness	1
there	1
was	1
good	1
humour	1
and	1
kindness	1
mr	1
darcy	1
said	1
very	1
little	1
and	1
mr	1
hurst	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
former	1
was	1
divided	1
between	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
brilliancy	1
which	1
exercise	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
her	1
complexion	1
and	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
occasion	1
s	1
justifying	1
her	1
coming	1
so	1
far	1
alone	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
breakfast	1
her	1
inquiries	1
after	1
her	1
sister	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
favourably	1
answered	1
miss	1
bennet	1
had	1
slept	1
ill	1
and	1
though	1
up	1
was	1
very	1
feverish	1
and	1
not	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
room	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
her	1
immediately	1
and	1
jane	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
withheld	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
giving	1
alarm	1
or	1
inconvenience	1
from	1
expressing	1
in	1
her	1
note	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
longed	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
visit	1
was	1
delighted	1
at	1
her	1
entrance	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
equal	1
however	1
to	1
much	1
conversation	1
and	1
when	1
miss	1
bingley	1
left	1
them	1
together	1
could	1
attempt	1
little	1
besides	1
expressions	1
of	1
gratitude	1
for	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
kindness	1
she	1
was	1
treated	1
with	1
elizabeth	1
silently	1
attended	1
her	1
when	1
breakfast	1
was	1
over	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
the	1
sisters	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
began	1
to	1
like	1
them	1
herself	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
how	1
much	1
affection	1
and	1
solicitude	1
they	1
showed	1
for	1
jane	1
the	1
apothecary	1
came	1
and	1
having	1
examined	1
his	1
patient	1
said	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
caught	1
a	1
violent	1
cold	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
endeavour	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
it	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
promised	1
her	1
some	1
draughts	1
the	1
advice	1
was	1
followed	1
readily	1
for	1
the	1
feverish	1
symptoms	1
increased	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
ached	1
acutely	1
elizabeth	1
did	1
not	1
quit	1
her	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
nor	1
were	1
the	1
other	1
ladies	1
often	1
absent	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
being	1
out	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
elsewhere	1
when	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
three	1
elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
very	1
unwillingly	1
said	1
so	1
miss	1
bingley	1
offered	1
her	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
she	1
only	1
wanted	1
a	1
little	1
pressing	1
to	1
accept	1
it	1
when	1
jane	1
testified	1
such	1
concern	1
in	1
parting	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
miss	1
bingley	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
convert	1
the	1
offer	1
of	1
the	1
chaise	1
to	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
netherfield	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
elizabeth	1
most	1
thankfully	1
consented	1
and	1
a	1
servant	1
was	1
dispatched	1
to	1
longbourn	1
to	1
acquaint	1
the	1
family	1
with	1
her	1
stay	1
and	1
bring	1
back	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
clothes	1
chapter	1
8	1
at	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
retired	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
at	1
half	1
past	1
six	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
dinner	1
to	1
the	1
civil	1
inquiries	1
which	1
then	1
poured	1
in	1
and	1
amongst	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
distinguishing	1
the	1
much	1
superior	1
solicitude	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
favourable	1
answer	1
jane	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
better	1
the	1
sisters	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
repeated	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
times	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
were	1
grieved	1
how	1
shocking	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
bad	1
cold	1
and	1
how	1
excessively	1
they	1
disliked	1
being	1
ill	1
themselves	1
and	1
then	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
their	1
indifference	1
towards	1
jane	1
when	1
not	1
immediately	1
before	1
them	1
restored	1
elizabeth	1
to	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
dislike	1
their	1
brother	1
indeed	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
regard	1
with	1
any	1
complacency	1
his	1
anxiety	1
for	1
jane	1
was	1
evident	1
and	1
his	1
attentions	1
to	1
herself	1
most	1
pleasing	1
and	1
they	1
prevented	1
her	1
feeling	1
herself	1
so	1
much	1
an	1
intruder	1
as	1
she	1
believed	1
she	1
was	1
considered	1
by	1
the	1
others	1
she	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
notice	1
from	1
any	1
but	1
him	1
miss	1
bingley	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
mr	1
darcy	1
her	1
sister	1
scarcely	1
less	1
so	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
mr	1
hurst	1
by	1
whom	1
elizabeth	1
sat	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
indolent	1
man	1
who	1
lived	1
only	1
to	1
eat	1
drink	1
and	1
play	1
at	1
cards	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
to	1
prefer	1
a	1
plain	1
dish	1
to	1
a	1
ragout	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
dinner	1
was	1
over	1
she	1
returned	1
directly	1
to	1
jane	1
and	1
miss	1
bingley	1
began	1
abusing	1
her	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
her	1
manners	1
were	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
bad	1
indeed	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
pride	1
and	1
impertinence	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
conversation	1
no	1
style	1
no	1
beauty	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
thought	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
added	1
she	1
has	1
nothing	1
in	1
short	1
to	1
recommend	1
her	1
but	1
being	1
an	1
excellent	1
walker	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
her	1
appearance	1
this	1
morning	1
she	1
really	1
looked	1
almost	1
wild	1
she	1
did	1
indeed	1
louisa	1
i	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
my	1
countenance	1
very	1
nonsensical	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
all	1
why	1
must	1
she	1
be	1
scampering	1
about	1
the	1
country	1
because	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
a	1
cold	1
her	1
hair	1
so	1
untidy	1
so	1
blowsy	1
yes	1
and	1
her	1
petticoat	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
saw	1
her	1
petticoat	1
six	1
inches	1
deep	1
in	1
mud	1
i	1
am	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
and	1
the	1
gown	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
let	1
down	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
not	1
doing	1
its	1
office	1
your	1
picture	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
exact	1
louisa	1
said	1
bingley	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
lost	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
thought	1
miss	1
elizabeth	1
bennet	1
looked	1
remarkably	1
well	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
this	1
morning	1
her	1
dirty	1
petticoat	1
quite	1
escaped	1
my	1
notice	1
you	1
observed	1
it	1
mr	1
darcy	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
said	1
miss	1
bingley	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
sister	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
exhibition	1
certainly	1
not	1
to	1
walk	1
three	1
miles	1
or	1
four	1
miles	1
or	1
five	1
miles	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
is	1
above	1
her	1
ankles	1
in	1
dirt	1
and	1
alone	1
quite	1
alone	1
what	1
could	1
she	1
mean	1
by	1
it	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
show	1
an	1
abominable	1
sort	1
of	1
conceited	1
independence	1
a	1
most	1
country	1
town	1
indifference	1
to	1
decorum	1
it	1
shows	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
pleasing	1
said	1
bingley	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
mr	1
darcy	1
observed	1
miss	1
bingley	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper	1
that	1
this	1
adventure	1
has	1
rather	1
affected	1
your	1
admiration	1
of	1
her	1
fine	1
eyes	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
replied	1
they	1
were	1
brightened	1
by	1
the	1
exercise	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
followed	1
this	1
speech	1
and	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
began	1
again	1
i	1
have	1
an	1
excessive	1
regard	1
for	1
miss	1
jane	1
bennet	1
she	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
very	1
sweet	1
girl	1
and	1
i	1
wish	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
she	1
were	1
well	1
settled	1
but	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
and	1
such	1
low	1
connections	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
their	1
uncle	1
is	1
an	1
attorney	1
in	1
meryton	1
yes	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
another	1
who	1
lives	1
somewhere	1
near	1
cheapside	1
that	1
is	1
capital	1
added	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
laughed	1
heartily	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
uncles	1
enough	1
to	1
fill	1
all	1
cheapside	1
cried	1
bingley	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
them	1
one	1
jot	1
less	1
agreeable	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
very	1
materially	1
lessen	1
their	1
chance	1
of	1
marrying	1
men	1
of	1
any	1
consideration	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
replied	1
darcy	1
to	1
this	1
speech	1
bingley	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
his	1
sisters	1
gave	1
it	1
their	1
hearty	1
assent	1
and	1
indulged	1
their	1
mirth	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
their	1
dear	1
friend	1
s	1
vulgar	1
relations	1
with	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
tenderness	1
however	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
on	1
leaving	1
the	1
dining	1
parlour	1
and	1
sat	1
with	1
her	1
till	1
summoned	1
to	1
coffee	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
very	1
poorly	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
would	1
not	1
quit	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
till	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
sleep	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
rather	1
right	1
than	1
pleasant	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
downstairs	1
herself	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
at	1
loo	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
invited	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
but	1
suspecting	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
playing	1
high	1
she	1
declined	1
it	1
and	1
making	1
her	1
sister	1
the	1
excuse	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
amuse	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
short	1
time	1
she	1
could	1
stay	1
below	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
mr	1
hurst	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
astonishment	1
do	1
you	1
prefer	1
reading	1
to	1
cards	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
rather	1
singular	1
miss	1
eliza	1
bennet	1
said	1
miss	1
bingley	1
despises	1
cards	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
reader	1
and	1
has	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
anything	1
else	1
i	1
deserve	1
neither	1
such	1
praise	1
nor	1
such	1
censure	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
great	1
reader	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
pleasure	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
in	1
nursing	1
your	1
sister	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
have	1
pleasure	1
said	1
bingley	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
soon	1
increased	1
by	1
seeing	1
her	1
quite	1
well	1
elizabeth	1
thanked	1
him	1
from	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
then	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
a	1
few	1
books	1
were	1
lying	1
he	1
immediately	1
offered	1
to	1
fetch	1
her	1
others	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
library	1
afforded	1
and	1
i	1
wish	1
my	1
collection	1
were	1
larger	1
for	1
your	1
benefit	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
credit	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
an	1
idle	1
fellow	1
and	1
though	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
many	1
i	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
i	1
ever	1
looked	1
into	1
elizabeth	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
suit	1
herself	1
perfectly	1
with	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
am	1
astonished	1
said	1
miss	1
bingley	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
should	1
have	1
left	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
books	1
what	1
a	1
delightful	1
library	1
you	1
have	1
at	1
pemberley	1
mr	1
darcy	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
he	1
replied	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
many	1
generations	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
have	1
added	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
it	1
yourself	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
buying	1
books	1
i	1
cannot	1
comprehend	1
the	1
neglect	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
library	1
in	1
such	1
days	1
as	1
these	1
neglect	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
neglect	1
nothing	1
that	1
can	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
that	1
noble	1
place	1
charles	1
when	1
you	1
build	1
your	1
house	1
i	1
wish	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
half	1
as	1
delightful	1
as	1
pemberley	1
i	1
wish	1
it	1
may	1
but	1
i	1
would	1
really	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
purchase	1
in	1
that	1
neighbourhood	1
and	1
take	1
pemberley	1
for	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
model	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
finer	1
county	1
in	1
england	1
than	1
derbyshire	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
will	1
buy	1
pemberley	1
itself	1
if	1
darcy	1
will	1
sell	1
it	1
i	1
am	1
talking	1
of	1
possibilities	1
charles	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
caroline	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
more	1
possible	1
to	1
get	1
pemberley	1
by	1
purchase	1
than	1
by	1
imitation	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
caught	1
with	1
what	1
passed	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
very	1
little	1
attention	1
for	1
her	1
book	1
and	1
soon	1
laying	1
it	1
wholly	1
aside	1
she	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
card	1
table	1
and	1
stationed	1
herself	1
between	1
mr	1
bingley	1
and	1
his	1
eldest	1
sister	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
game	1
is	1
miss	1
darcy	1
much	1
grown	1
since	1
the	1
spring	1
said	1
miss	1
bingley	1
will	1
she	1
be	1
as	1
tall	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
i	1
think	1
she	1
will	1
she	1
is	1
now	1
about	1
miss	1
elizabeth	1
bennet	1
s	1
height	1
or	1
rather	1
taller	1
how	1
i	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
again	1
i	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
anybody	1
who	1
delighted	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
such	1
a	1
countenance	1
such	1
manners	1
and	1
so	1
extremely	1
accomplished	1
for	1
her	1
age	1
her	1
performance	1
on	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
is	1
exquisite	1
it	1
is	1
amazing	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
bingley	1
how	1
young	1
ladies	1
can	1
have	1
patience	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
accomplished	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
are	1
all	1
young	1
ladies	1
accomplished	1
my	1
dear	1
charles	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
yes	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
think	1
they	1
all	1
paint	1
tables	1
cover	1
screens	1
and	1
net	1
purses	1
i	1
scarcely	1
know	1
anyone	1
who	1
cannot	1
do	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
i	1
never	1
heard	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
without	1
being	1
informed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
accomplished	1
your	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
extent	1
of	1
accomplishments	1
said	1
darcy	1
has	1
too	1
much	1
truth	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
applied	1
to	1
many	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
deserves	1
it	1
no	1
otherwise	1
than	1
by	1
netting	1
a	1
purse	1
or	1
covering	1
a	1
screen	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
agreeing	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
estimation	1
of	1
ladies	1
in	1
general	1
i	1
cannot	1

sure	1
said	1
miss	1
bingley	1
then	1
observed	1
elizabeth	1
you	1
must	1
comprehend	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
your	1
idea	1
of	1
an	1
accomplished	1
woman	1
yes	1
i	1
do	1
comprehend	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
it	1
oh	1
certainly	1
cried	1
his	1
faithful	1
assistant	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
be	1
really	1
esteemed	1
accomplished	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
greatly	1
surpass	1
what	1
is	1
usually	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
thorough	1
knowledge	1
of	1
music	1
singing	1
drawing	1
dancing	1
and	1
the	1
modern	1
languages	1
to	1
deserve	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
besides	1
all	1
this	1
she	1
must	1
possess	1
a	1
certain	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
air	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
walking	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
her	1

the	1

will	1
be	1

half	1
deserved	1
all	1
this	1
she	1
must	1
possess	1
added	1
darcy	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
she	1
must	1
yet	1
add	1
something	1
more	1
substantial	1
in	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
by	1
extensive	1
reading	1
i	1
am	1
no	1
longer	1
surprised	1
at	1
your	1
knowing	1
only	1
six	1
accomplished	1
women	1
i	1
rather	1
wonder	1
now	1
at	1
your	1
knowing	1
any	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
severe	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
sex	1
as	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
capacity	1
and	1
taste	1
and	1
application	1
and	1
elegance	1
as	1
you	1
describe	1
united	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
and	1
miss	1
bingley	1
both	1
cried	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
her	1
implied	1
doubt	1
and	1
were	1
both	1
protesting	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
many	1
women	1
who	1
answered	1
this	1
description	1
when	1
mr	1
hurst	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
order	1
with	1
bitter	1
complaints	1
of	1
their	1
inattention	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
forward	1
as	1
all	1
conversation	1
was	1
thereby	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
elizabeth	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
elizabeth	1
bennet	1
said	1
miss	1
bingley	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closed	1
on	1
her	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
seek	1
to	1
recommend	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
sex	1
by	1
undervaluing	1
their	1
own	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
men	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
it	1
succeeds	1
but	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
paltry	1
device	1
a	1
very	1
mean	1
art	1
undoubtedly	1
replied	1
darcy	1
to	1
whom	1
this	1
remark	1
was	1
chiefly	1
addressed	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
meanness	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
arts	1
which	1
ladies	1
sometimes	1
condescend	1
to	1
employ	1
for	1
captivation	1
whatever	1
bears	1
affinity	1
to	1
cunning	1
is	1
despicable	1
miss	1
bingley	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
entirely	1
satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
reply	1
as	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
subject	1
elizabeth	1
joined	1
them	1
again	1
only	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
worse	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
bingley	1
urged	1
mr	1
jones	1
being	1
sent	1
for	1
immediately	1
while	1
his	1
sisters	1
convinced	1
that	1
no	1
country	1
advice	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
service	1
recommended	1
an	1
express	1
to	1
town	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
eminent	1
physicians	1
this	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
unwilling	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
proposal	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
mr	1
jones	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
if	1
miss	1
bennet	1
were	1
not	1
decidedly	1
better	1
bingley	1
was	1
quite	1
uncomfortable	1
his	1
sisters	1
declared	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
miserable	1
they	1
solaced	1
their	1
wretchedness	1
however	1
by	1
duets	1
after	1
supper	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
better	1
relief	1
to	1
his	1
feelings	1
than	1
by	1
giving	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
directions	1
that	1
every	1
attention	1
might	1
be	1
paid	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1

elizabeth	1
passed	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
room	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
tolerable	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
inquiries	1
which	1
she	1
very	1
early	1
received	1
from	1
mr	1
bingley	1
by	1
a	1
housemaid	1
and	1
some	1
time	1
afterwards	1
from	1
the	1
two	1
elegant	1
ladies	1
who	1
waited	1
on	1
his	1
sisters	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
amendment	1
however	1
she	1
requested	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
note	1
sent	1
to	1
longbourn	1
desiring	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
visit	1
jane	1
and	1
form	1
her	1
own	1
judgement	1
of	1
her	1
situation	1
the	1
note	1
was	1
immediately	1
dispatched	1
and	1
its	1
contents	1
as	1
quickly	1
complied	1
with	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
accompanied	1
by	1
her	1
two	1
youngest	1
girls	1
reached	1
netherfield	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
family	1
breakfast	1
had	1
she	1
found	1
jane	1
in	1
any	1
apparent	1
danger	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
miserable	1
but	1
being	1
satisfied	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
illness	1
was	1
not	1
alarming	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
of	1
her	1
recovering	1
immediately	1
as	1
her	1
restoration	1
to	1
health	1
would	1
probably	1
remove	1
her	1
from	1
netherfield	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
listen	1
therefore	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
proposal	1
of	1
being	1
carried	1
home	1
neither	1
did	1
the	1
apothecary	1
who	1
arrived	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
think	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
advisable	1
after	1
sitting	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
with	1
jane	1
on	1
miss	1
bingley	1
s	1
appearance	1
and	1
invitation	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
three	1
daughters	1
all	1
attended	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast	1
parlour	1
bingley	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
hopes	1
that	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
miss	1
bennet	1
worse	1
than	1
she	1
expected	1
indeed	1
i	1
have	1
sir	1
was	1
her	1
answer	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
ill	1
to	1
be	1
moved	1
mr	1
jones	1
says	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
moving	1
her	1
we	1
must	1
trespass	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
on	1
your	1
kindness	1
removed	1
cried	1
bingley	1
it	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
sister	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
removal	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
madam	1
said	1
miss	1
bingley	1
with	1
cold	1
civility	1
that	1
miss	1
bennet	1
will	1
receive	1
every	1
possible	1
attention	1
while	1
she	1
remains	1
with	1
us	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
profuse	1
in	1
her	1
acknowledgments	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
added	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
such	1
good	1
friends	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
her	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
ill	1
indeed	1
and	1
suffers	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
though	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
patience	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
without	1
exception	1
the	1
sweetest	1
temper	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
met	1
with	1
i	1
often	1
tell	1
my	1
other	1
girls	1
they	1
are	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
sweet	1
room	1
here	1
mr	1
bingley	1
and	1
a	1
charming	1
prospect	1
over	1
the	1
gravel	1
walk	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
that	1
is	1
equal	1
to	1
netherfield	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
quitting	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
i	1
hope	1
though	1
you	1
have	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
lease	1
whatever	1
i	1
do	1
is	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
replied	1
he	1
and	1
therefore	1
if	1
i	1
should	1
resolve	1
to	1
quit	1
netherfield	1
i	1
should	1
probably	1
be	1
off	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
at	1
present	1
however	1
i	1
consider	1
myself	1
as	1
quite	1
fixed	1
here	1
that	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
supposed	1
of	1
you	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
you	1
begin	1
to	1
comprehend	1
me	1
do	1
you	1
cried	1
he	1
turning	1
towards	1
her	1
oh	1
yes	1
i	1
understand	1
you	1
perfectly	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
might	1
take	1
this	1
for	1
a	1
compliment	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
easily	1
seen	1
through	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
is	1
pitiful	1
that	1
is	1
as	1
it	1
happens	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
a	1
deep	1
intricate	1
character	1
is	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
estimable	1
than	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
yours	1
lizzy	1
cried	1
her	1
mother	1
remember	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
run	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
manner	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
suffered	1
to	1
do	1
at	1
home	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
before	1
continued	1
bingley	1
immediately	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
studier	1
of	1
character	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
amusing	1
study	1
yes	1
but	1
intricate	1
characters	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
amusing	1
they	1
have	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
advantage	1
the	1
country	1
said	1
darcy	1
can	1
in	1
general	1
supply	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
subjects	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
study	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
neighbourhood	1
you	1
move	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
confined	1
and	1
unvarying	1
society	1
but	1
people	1
themselves	1
alter	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
new	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
in	1
them	1
for	1
ever	1
yes	1
indeed	1
cried	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
offended	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
mentioning	1
a	1
country	1
neighbourhood	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
that	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
in	1
town	1
everybody	1
was	1
surprised	1
and	1
darcy	1
after	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
turned	1
silently	1
away	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
who	1
fancied	1
she	1
had	1
gained	1
a	1
complete	1
victory	1
over	1
him	1
continued	1
her	1
triumph	1
i	1
cannot	1
see	1
that	1
london	1
has	1
any	1
great	1
advantage	1
over	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
except	1
the	1
shops	1
and	1
public	1
places	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
pleasanter	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
mr	1
bingley	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
replied	1
i	1
never	1
wish	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
town	1
it	1
is	1
pretty	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
they	1
have	1
each	1
their	1
advantages	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
be	1
equally	1
happy	1
in	1
either	1
aye	1
that	1
is	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
right	1
disposition	1
but	1
that	1
gentleman	1
looking	1
at	1
darcy	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
indeed	1
mamma	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
blushing	1
for	1
her	1
mother	1
you	1
quite	1
mistook	1
mr	1
darcy	1
he	1
only	1
meant	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
which	1
you	1
must	1
acknowledge	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
certainly	1
my	1
dear	1
nobody	1
said	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
not	1
meeting	1
with	1
many	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
neighbourhood	1
i	1
believe	1
there	1
are	1
few	1
neighbourhoods	1
larger	1
i	1
know	1
we	1
dine	1
with	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
families	1
nothing	1
but	1
concern	1
for	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
enable	1
bingley	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
countenance	1
his	1
sister	1
was	1
less	1
delicate	1
and	1
directed	1
her	1
eyes	1
towards	1
mr	1
darcy	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
expressive	1
smile	1
elizabeth	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
saying	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
turn	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
thoughts	1
now	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
charlotte	1
lucas	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
longbourn	1
since	1
her	1
coming	1
away	1
yes	1
she	1
called	1
yesterday	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
what	1
an	1
agreeable	1
man	1
sir	1
william	1
is	1
mr	1
bingley	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
fashion	1
so	1
genteel	1
and	1
easy	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
everybody	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
idea	1
of	1
good	1
breeding	1
and	1
those	1
persons	1
who	1
fancy	1
themselves	1
very	1
important	1
and	1
never	1
open	1
their	1
mouths	1
quite	1
mistake	1
the	1
matter	1
did	1
charlotte	1
dine	1
with	1
you	1
no	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
home	1
i	1
fancy	1
she	1
was	1
wanted	1
about	1
the	1
mince	1
pies	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
mr	1
bingley	1
i	1
always	1
keep	1
servants	1
that	1
can	1
do	1
their	1
own	1
work	1
my	1
daughters	1
are	1
brought	1
up	1
very	1
differently	1
but	1
everybody	1
is	1
to	1
judge	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
lucases	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
girls	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
handsome	1
not	1
that	1
i	1
think	1
charlotte	1
so	1
very	1
plain	1
but	1
then	1
she	1
is	1
our	1
particular	1
friend	1
she	1
seems	1
a	1
very	1
pleasant	1
young	1
woman	1
oh	1
dear	1
yes	1

you	1

she	1

very	1
plain	1
lady	1
lucas	1
herself	1
has	1
often	1
said	1
so	1
and	1
envied	1
me	1
jane	1
s	1
beauty	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
boast	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
child	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
jane	1
one	1
does	1
not	1
often	1
see	1
anybody	1
better	1
looking	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
everybody	1
says	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
trust	1
my	1
own	1
partiality	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
fifteen	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
my	1
brother	1
gardiner	1
s	1
in	1
town	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
my	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
before	1
we	1
came	1
away	1
but	1
however	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
perhaps	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
too	1
young	1
however	1
he	1
wrote	1
some	1
verses	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
very	1
pretty	1
they	1
were	1
and	1
so	1
ended	1
his	1
affection	1
said	1

impatiently	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
many	1
a	1
one	1
i	1
fancy	1
overcome	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
i	1
wonder	1
who	1
first	1
discovered	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
poetry	1
in	1
driving	1
away	1
love	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
consider	1
poetry	1
as	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
love	1
said	1
darcy	1
of	1
a	1
fine	1
stout	1
healthy	1
love	1
it	1
may	1
everything	1
nourishes	1
what	1
is	1
strong	1
already	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
slight	1
thin	1
sort	1
of	1
inclination	1
i	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
one	1
good	1
sonnet	1
will	1
starve	1
it	1
entirely	1
away	1
darcy	1
only	1
smiled	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
pause	1
which	1
ensued	1
made	1
elizabeth	1
tremble	1
lest	1
her	1
mother	1
should	1
be	1
exposing	1
herself	1
again	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
began	1
repeating	1
her	1
thanks	1
to	1
mr	1
bingley	1
for	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
jane	1
with	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
troubling	1
him	1
also	1
with	1
lizzy	1
mr	1
bingley	1
was	1
unaffectedly	1
civil	1
in	1
his	1
answer	1
and	1
forced	1
his	1
younger	1
sister	1
to	1
be	1
civil	1
also	1
and	1
say	1
what	1
the	1
occasion	1
required	1
she	1
performed	1
her	1
part	1
indeed	1
without	1
much	1
graciousness	1
but	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
satisfied	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
ordered	1
her	1
carriage	1
upon	1
this	1
signal	1
the	1
youngest	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
put	1
herself	1
forward	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
had	1
been	1
whispering	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
visit	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
youngest	1
should	1
tax	1
mr	1
bingley	1
with	1
having	1
promised	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
ball	1
at	1
netherfield	1
lydia	1
was	1
a	1
stout	1
well	1
grown	1
girl	1
of	1
fifteen	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
complexion	1
and	1
good	1
humoured	1
countenance	1
a	1
favourite	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
whose	1
affection	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
into	1
public	1
at	1
an	1
early	1
age	1
she	1
had	1
high	1
animal	1
spirits	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
natural	1
self	1
consequence	1
which	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
whom	1
her	1
uncle	1
s	1
good	1
dinners	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
easy	1
manners	1
recommended	1
her	1
had	1
increased	1
into	1
assurance	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
equal	1
therefore	1
to	1
address	1
mr	1
bingley	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
abruptly	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
promise	1
adding	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
shameful	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
it	1
his	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
sudden	1
attack	1
was	1
delightful	1
to	1
their	1
mother	1
s	1
ear	1
i	1
am	1
perfectly	1
ready	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
engagement	1
and	1
when	1
your	1
sister	1
is	1
recovered	1
you	1
shall	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
name	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ball	1
but	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
dancing	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
ill	1
lydia	1
declared	1
herself	1
satisfied	1
oh	1
yes	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
better	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
jane	1
was	1
well	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
most	1
likely	1
captain	1
carter	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
meryton	1
again	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
your	1
ball	1
she	1
added	1
i	1
shall	1
insist	1
on	1
their	1
giving	1
one	1
also	1
i	1
shall	1
tell	1
colonel	1
forster	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
shame	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
then	1
departed	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
returned	1
instantly	1
to	1

leaving	1
her	1

the	1
remarks	1

of	1
whom	1
however	1
could	1
not	1

prevailed	1
on	1
to	1

in	1
their	1
censure	1

the	1

much	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
had	1
done	1
mrs	1

and	1
miss	1
bingley	1
had	1
spent	1
some	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
with	1
the	1
invalid	1
who	1
continued	1
though	1
slowly	1
to	1
mend	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
elizabeth	1
joined	1
their	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1

the	1

however	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
mr	1

was	1
writing	1
and	1
miss	1
bingley	1
seated	1
near	1
him	1
was	1
watching	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
calling	1
off	1
his	1
attention	1
by	1
messages	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
mr	1
hurst	1
and	1
mr	1
bingley	1
were	1
at	1
piquet	1
and	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
was	1
observing	1
their	1
game	1
elizabeth	1
took	1
up	1
some	1
needlework	1
and	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
amused	1
in	1
attending	1
to	1
what	1
passed	1
between	1
darcy	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
the	1
perpetual	1
commendations	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
either	1
on	1
his	1
handwriting	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
evenness	1
of	1
his	1
lines	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
with	1
the	1
perfect	1
unconcern	1
with	1
which	1
her	1
praises	1
were	1
received	1
formed	1
a	1
curious	1
dialogue	1
and	1
was	1
exactly	1
in	1
union	1
with	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
each	1
how	1
delighted	1
miss	1
darcy	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
receive	1
such	1
a	1
letter	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
you	1
write	1
uncommonly	1
fast	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
i	1
write	1
rather	1
slowly	1
how	1
many	1
letters	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
occasion	1
to	1
write	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
letters	1
of	1
business	1
too	1
how	1
odious	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
fortunate	1
then	1
that	1
they	1
fall	1
to	1
my	1
lot	1
instead	1
of	1
yours	1
pray	1
tell	1
your	1
sister	1
that	1
i	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
i	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
her	1
so	1
once	1
by	1
your	1
desire	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
your	1
pen	1
let	1
me	1
mend	1
it	1
for	1
you	1
i	1
mend	1
pens	1
remarkably	1
well	1
thank	1
you	1
but	1
i	1
always	1
mend	1
my	1
own	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
contrive	1
to	1
write	1
so	1
even	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
tell	1
your	1
sister	1
i	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
improvement	1
on	1
the	1
harp	1
and	1
pray	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
quite	1
in	1
raptures	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
little	1
design	1
for	1
a	1
table	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
infinitely	1
superior	1
to	1
miss	1
grantley	1
s	1
will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
defer	1
your	1
raptures	1
till	1
i	1
write	1
again	1
at	1
present	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
room	1
to	1
do	1
them	1
justice	1
oh	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
i	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
january	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
always	1
write	1
such	1
charming	1
long	1
letters	1
to	1
her	1
mr	1
darcy	1
they	1
are	1
generally	1
long	1
but	1
whether	1
always	1
charming	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
determine	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
rule	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
can	1
write	1
a	1
long	1
letter	1
with	1
ease	1
cannot	1
write	1
ill	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
compliment	1
to	1
darcy	1
caroline	1
cried	1
her	1
brother	1
because	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
write	1
with	1
ease	1
he	1
studies	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
words	1
of	1
four	1
syllables	1
do	1
not	1
you	1
darcy	1
my	1
style	1
of	1
writing	1
is	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
yours	1
oh	1
cried	1
miss	1
bingley	1
charles	1
writes	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
careless	1
way	1
imaginable	1
he	1
leaves	1
out	1
half	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
blots	1
the	1
rest	1
my	1
ideas	1
flow	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
express	1
them	1
by	1
which	1
means	1
my	1
letters	1
sometimes	1
convey	1
no	1
ideas	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
my	1
correspondents	1
your	1
humility	1
mr	1
bingley	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
must	1
disarm	1
reproof	1
nothing	1
is	1
more	1
deceitful	1
said	1
darcy	1
than	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
humility	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
only	1
carelessness	1
of	1
opinion	1
and	1
sometimes	1
an	1
indirect	1
boast	1
and	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
my	1
little	1
recent	1
piece	1
of	1
modesty	1
the	1
indirect	1
boast	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
proud	1
of	1
your	1
defects	1
in	1
writing	1
because	1
you	1
consider	1
them	1
as	1
proceeding	1
from	1
a	1
rapidity	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
carelessness	1
of	1
execution	1
which	1
if	1
not	1
estimable	1
you	1
think	1
at	1
least	1
highly	1
interesting	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
with	1
quickness	1
is	1
always	1
prized	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
possessor	1
and	1
often	1
without	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
imperfection	1
of	1
the	1
performance	1
when	1
you	1
told	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
this	1
morning	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
resolved	1
upon	1
quitting	1
netherfield	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
gone	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
you	1
meant	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
panegyric	1
of	1
compliment	1
to	1
yourself	1
and	1
yet	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
so	1
very	1
laudable	1
in	1
a	1
precipitance	1
which	1
must	1
leave	1
very	1
necessary	1
business	1
undone	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
real	1
advantage	1
to	1
yourself	1
or	1
anyone	1
else	1
nay	1
cried	1
bingley	1
this	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
remember	1
at	1
night	1
all	1
the	1
foolish	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
yet	1
upon	1
my	1
honour	1
i	1
believe	1
what	1
i	1
said	1
of	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
and	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
at	1
least	1
therefore	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
assume	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
needless	1
precipitance	1
merely	1
to	1
show	1
off	1
before	1
the	1
ladies	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
believed	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
convinced	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
gone	1
with	1
such	1
celerity	1
your	1
conduct	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
as	1
dependent	1
on	1
chance	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
i	1
know	1
and	1
if	1
as	1
you	1
were	1
mounting	1
your	1
horse	1
a	1
friend	1
were	1
to	1
say	1
bingley	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
stay	1
till	1
next	1
week	1
you	1
would	1
probably	1
do	1
it	1
you	1
would	1
probably	1
not	1
go	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
word	1
might	1
stay	1
a	1
month	1
you	1
have	1
only	1
proved	1
by	1
this	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
that	1
mr	1
bingley	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
disposition	1
you	1
have	1
shown	1
him	1
off	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
himself	1
i	1
am	1
exceedingly	1
gratified	1
said	1
bingley	1
by	1
your	1
converting	1
what	1
my	1
friend	1
says	1
into	1
a	1
compliment	1
on	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
my	1
temper	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
are	1
giving	1
it	1
a	1
turn	1
which	1
that	1
gentleman	1
did	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
intend	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
think	1
better	1
of	1
me	1
if	1
under	1
such	1
a	1
circumstance	1
i	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
flat	1
denial	1
and	1
ride	1
off	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
would	1
mr	1
darcy	1
then	1
consider	1
the	1
rashness	1
of	1
your	1
original	1
intentions	1
as	1
atoned	1
for	1
by	1
your	1
obstinacy	1
in	1
adhering	1
to	1
it	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
i	1
cannot	1
exactly	1
explain	1
the	1
matter	1
darcy	1
must	1
speak	1
for	1
himself	1
you	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
opinions	1
which	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
call	1
mine	1
but	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
acknowledged	1
allowing	1
the	1
case	1
however	1
to	1
stand	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
representation	1
you	1
must	1
remember	1
miss	1
bennet	1
that	1
the	1
friend	1
who	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
desire	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
delay	1
of	1
his	1
plan	1
has	1
merely	1
desired	1
it	1
asked	1
it	1
without	1
offering	1
one	1
argument	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
its	1
propriety	1
to	1
yield	1
readily	1
easily	1
to	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
is	1
no	1
merit	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
yield	1
without	1
conviction	1
is	1
no	1
compliment	1
to	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
either	1
you	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
mr	1
darcy	1
to	1
allow	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
friendship	1
and	1
affection	1
a	1
regard	1
for	1
the	1
requester	1
would	1
often	1
make	1
one	1
readily	1
yield	1
to	1
a	1
request	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
arguments	1
to	1
reason	1
one	1
into	1
it	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
particularly	1
speaking	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
supposed	1
about	1
mr	1
bingley	1
we	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
wait	1
perhaps	1
till	1
the	1
circumstance	1
occurs	1
before	1
we	1
discuss	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
his	1
behaviour	1
thereupon	1
but	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
ordinary	1
cases	1
between	1
friend	1
and	1
friend	1
where	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
desired	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
change	1
a	1
resolution	1
of	1
no	1
very	1
great	1
moment	1
should	1
you	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
that	1
person	1
for	1
complying	1
with	1
the	1
desire	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
argued	1
into	1
it	1
will	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
advisable	1
before	1
we	1
proceed	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
to	1
arrange	1
with	1
rather	1
more	1
precision	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
importance	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
appertain	1
to	1
this	1
request	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
intimacy	1
subsisting	1
between	1
the	1
parties	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
cried	1
bingley	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
not	1
forgetting	1
their	1
comparative	1
height	1
and	1
size	1
for	1
that	1
will	1
have	1
more	1
weight	1
in	1
the	1
argument	1
miss	1
bennet	1
than	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
darcy	1
were	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
tall	1
fellow	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
myself	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
pay	1
him	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
deference	1
i	1
declare	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
a	1
more	1
awful	1
object	1
than	1
darcy	1
on	1
particular	1
occasions	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
places	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
especially	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
sunday	1
evening	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
mr	1
darcy	1
smiled	1
but	1
elizabeth	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
perceive	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
rather	1
offended	1
and	1
therefore	1
checked	1
her	1
laugh	1
miss	1
bingley	1
warmly	1
resented	1
the	1
indignity	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
in	1
an	1
expostulation	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
for	1
talking	1
such	1
nonsense	1
i	1
see	1
your	1
design	1
bingley	1
said	1
his	1
friend	1
you	1
dislike	1
an	1
argument	1
and	1
want	1
to	1
silence	1
this	1
perhaps	1
i	1
do	1
arguments	1
are	1
too	1
much	1
like	1
disputes	1
if	1
you	1
and	1
miss	1
bennet	1
will	1
defer	1
yours	1
till	1
i	1
am	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
thankful	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
whatever	1
you	1
like	1
of	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
ask	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
is	1
no	1
sacrifice	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
and	1
mr	1
darcy	1
had	1
much	1
better	1
finish	1
his	1
letter	1
mr	1
darcy	1
took	1
her	1
advice	1
and	1
did	1
finish	1
his	1
letter	1
when	1
that	1
business	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
applied	1
to	1
miss	1
bingley	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
for	1
an	1
indulgence	1
of	1
some	1
music	1
miss	1
bingley	1
moved	1
with	1
some	1
alacrity	1
to	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
polite	1
request	1
that	1
elizabeth	1
would	1
lead	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
politely	1
and	1
more	1
earnestly	1
negatived	1
she	1
seated	1
herself	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
sang	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
employed	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
observing	1
as	1
she	1
turned	1
over	1
some	1
music	1
books	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
instrument	1
how	1
frequently	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
admiration	1
to	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
because	1
he	1
disliked	1
her	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
strange	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
imagine	1
however	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
she	1
drew	1
his	1
notice	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
more	1
wrong	1
and	1
reprehensible	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ideas	1
of	1
right	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
present	1
the	1
supposition	1
did	1
not	1
pain	1
her	1
she	1
liked	1
him	1
too	1
little	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
his	1
approbation	1
after	1
playing	1
some	1
italian	1
songs	1
miss	1
bingley	1
varied	1
the	1
charm	1
by	1
a	1
lively	1
scotch	1
air	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
mr	1
darcy	1
drawing	1
near	1
elizabeth	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
do	1
not	1
you	1
feel	1
a	1
great	1
inclination	1
miss	1
bennet	1
to	1
seize	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
dancing	1
a	1
reel	1
she	1
smiled	1
but	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
he	1
repeated	1
the	1
question	1
with	1
some	1
surprise	1
at	1
her	1
silence	1
oh	1
said	1
she	1
i	1
heard	1
you	1
before	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
immediately	1
determine	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
reply	1
you	1
wanted	1
me	1
i	1
know	1
to	1
say	1
yes	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
despising	1
my	1
taste	1
but	1
i	1
always	1
delight	1
in	1
overthrowing	1
those	1
kind	1
of	1
schemes	1
and	1
cheating	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
their	1
premeditated	1
contempt	1
i	1
have	1
therefore	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
dance	1
a	1
reel	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
now	1
despise	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
dare	1
indeed	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
dare	1
elizabeth	1
having	1
rather	1
expected	1
to	1
affront	1
him	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
his	1
gallantry	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
sweetness	1
and	1
archness	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
affront	1
anybody	1
and	1
darcy	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
bewitched	1
by	1
any	1
woman	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
her	1
he	1
really	1
believed	1
that	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
inferiority	1
of	1
her	1
connections	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
some	1
danger	1
miss	1
bingley	1
saw	1
or	1
suspected	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
jealous	1
and	1
her	1
great	1
anxiety	1
for	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
her	1
dear	1
friend	1
jane	1
received	1
some	1
assistance	1
from	1
her	1
desire	1
of	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
she	1
often	1
tried	1
to	1
provoke	1
darcy	1
into	1
disliking	1
her	1
guest	1
by	1
talking	1
of	1
their	1
supposed	1
marriage	1
and	1
planning	1
his	1
happiness	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
alliance	1
i	1
hope	1
said	1
she	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
shrubbery	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
your	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
a	1
few	1
hints	1
when	1
this	1
desirable	1
event	1
takes	1
place	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
holding	1
her	1
tongue	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
compass	1
it	1
do	1
cure	1
the	1
younger	1
girls	1
of	1
running	1
after	1
officers	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
may	1
mention	1
so	1
delicate	1
a	1
subject	1
endeavour	1
to	1
check	1
that	1
little	1
something	1
bordering	1
on	1
conceit	1
and	1
impertinence	1
which	1
your	1
lady	1
possesses	1
have	1
you	1
anything	1
else	1
to	1
propose	1
for	1
my	1
domestic	1
felicity	1
oh	1
yes	1
do	1
let	1
the	1
portraits	1
of	1
your	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
phillips	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
gallery	1
at	1
pemberley	1
put	1
them	1
next	1
to	1
your	1
great	1
uncle	1
the	1
judge	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
profession	1
you	1
know	1
only	1
in	1
different	1
lines	1
as	1
for	1
your	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
picture	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
have	1
it	1
taken	1
for	1
what	1
painter	1
could	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
those	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
easy	1
indeed	1
to	1
catch	1
their	1
expression	1
but	1
their	1
colour	1
and	1
shape	1
and	1
the	1
eyelashes	1
so	1
remarkably	1
fine	1
might	1
be	1
copied	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
from	1
another	1
walk	1
by	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
herself	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
intended	1
to	1
walk	1
said	1
miss	1
bingley	1
in	1
some	1
confusion	1
lest	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
overheard	1
you	1
used	1
us	1
abominably	1
ill	1
answered	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
running	1
away	1
without	1
telling	1
us	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
coming	1
out	1
then	1
taking	1
the	1
disengaged	1
arm	1
of	1
mr	1
darcy	1
she	1
left	1
elizabeth	1
to	1
walk	1
by	1
herself	1
the	1
path	1
just	1
admitted	1
three	1
mr	1
darcy	1
felt	1
their	1
rudeness	1
and	1
immediately	1
said	1
this	1
walk	1
is	1
not	1
wide	1
enough	1
for	1
our	1
party	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
avenue	1
but	1
elizabeth	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
inclination	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
them	1
laughingly	1
answered	1
no	1
no	1
stay	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
are	1
charmingly	1
grouped	1
and	1
appear	1
to	1
uncommon	1
advantage	1
the	1
picturesque	1
would	1
be	1
spoilt	1
by	1
admitting	1
a	1
fourth	1
good	1
bye	1
she	1
then	1
ran	1
gaily	1
off	1
rejoicing	1
as	1
she	1
rambled	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
being	1
at	1
home	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
jane	1
was	1
already	1
so	1
much	1
recovered	1
as	1
to	1
intend	1
leaving	1
her	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hours	1
that	1
evening	1
chapter	1
11	1
when	1
the	1
ladies	1
removed	1
after	1
dinner	1
elizabeth	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
seeing	1
her	1
well	1
guarded	1
from	1
cold	1
attended	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
welcomed	1
by	1
her	1
two	1
friends	1
with	1
many	1
professions	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
them	1
so	1
agreeable	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
during	1
the	1
hour	1
which	1
passed	1
before	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
appeared	1
their	1
powers	1
of	1
conversation	1
were	1
considerable	1
they	1
could	1
describe	1
an	1
entertainment	1
with	1
accuracy	1
relate	1
an	1
anecdote	1
with	1
humour	1
and	1
laugh	1
at	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
spirit	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
entered	1
jane	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
first	1
object	1
miss	1
bingley	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
instantly	1
turned	1
toward	1
darcy	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
advanced	1
many	1
steps	1
he	1
addressed	1
himself	1
to	1
miss	1
bennet	1
with	1
a	1
polite	1
congratulation	1
mr	1
hurst	1
also	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
but	1
diffuseness	1
and	1
warmth	1
remained	1
for	1
bingley	1
s	1
salutation	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
attention	1
the	1
first	1
half	1
hour	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
piling	1
up	1
the	1
fire	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
room	1
and	1
she	1
removed	1
at	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fireplace	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
then	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
her	1
and	1
talked	1
scarcely	1
to	1
anyone	1
else	1
elizabeth	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
corner	1
saw	1
it	1
all	1
with	1
great	1
delight	1
when	1
tea	1
was	1
over	1
mr	1
hurst	1
reminded	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
card	1
table	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
she	1
had	1
obtained	1
private	1
intelligence	1
that	1
mr	1
darcy	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
cards	1
and	1
mr	1
hurst	1
soon	1
found	1
even	1
his	1
open	1
petition	1
rejected	1
she	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
intended	1
to	1
play	1
and	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
seemed	1
to	1
justify	1
her	1
mr	1
hurst	1
had	1
therefore	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sofas	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
darcy	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
book	1
miss	1
bingley	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
principally	1
occupied	1
in	1
playing	1
with	1
her	1
bracelets	1
and	1
rings	1
joined	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
conversation	1
with	1
miss	1
bennet	1
miss	1
bingley	1
s	1
attention	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
engaged	1
in	1
watching	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
progress	1
through	1
his	1
book	1
as	1
in	1
reading	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
perpetually	1
either	1
making	1
some	1
inquiry	1
or	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
page	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
win	1
him	1
however	1
to	1
any	1
conversation	1
he	1
merely	1
answered	1
her	1
question	1
and	1
read	1
on	1
at	1
length	1
quite	1
exhausted	1
by	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
be	1
amused	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
book	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
chosen	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
volume	1
of	1
his	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
great	1
yawn	1
and	1
said	1
how	1
pleasant	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
spend	1
an	1
evening	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
i	1
declare	1
after	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
enjoyment	1
like	1
reading	1
how	1
much	1
sooner	1
one	1
tires	1
of	1
anything	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
when	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
miserable	1
if	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
an	1
excellent	1
library	1
no	1
one	1
made	1
any	1
reply	1
she	1
then	1
yawned	1
again	1
threw	1
aside	1
her	1
book	1
and	1
cast	1
her	1
eyes	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
quest	1
for	1
some	1
amusement	1
when	1
hearing	1
her	1
brother	1
mentioning	1
a	1
ball	1
to	1
miss	1
bennet	1
she	1
turned	1
suddenly	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
by	1
the	1
bye	1
charles	1
are	1
you	1
really	1
serious	1
in	1
meditating	1
a	1
dance	1
at	1
netherfield	1
i	1
would	1
advise	1
you	1
before	1
you	1
determine	1
on	1
it	1
to	1
consult	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
party	1
i	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
some	1
among	1
us	1
to	1
whom	1
a	1
ball	1
would	1
be	1
rather	1
a	1
punishment	1
than	1
a	1
pleasure	1
if	1
you	1
mean	1
darcy	1
cried	1
her	1
brother	1
he	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
if	1
he	1
chooses	1
before	1
it	1
begins	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
ball	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
settled	1
thing	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
nicholls	1
has	1
made	1
white	1
soup	1
enough	1
i	1
shall	1
send	1
round	1
my	1
cards	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
balls	1
infinitely	1
better	1
she	1
replied	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
manner	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
insufferably	1
tedious	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
process	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
meeting	1
it	1
would	1
surely	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
rational	1
if	1
conversation	1
instead	1
of	1
dancing	1
were	1
made	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
much	1
more	1
rational	1
my	1
dear	1
caroline	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
near	1
so	1
much	1
like	1
a	1
ball	1
miss	1
bingley	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
her	1
figure	1
was	1
elegant	1
and	1
she	1
walked	1
well	1
but	1
darcy	1
at	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
aimed	1
was	1
still	1
inflexibly	1
studious	1
in	1
the	1
desperation	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
she	1
resolved	1
on	1
one	1
effort	1
more	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
said	1
miss	1
eliza	1
bennet	1
let	1
me	1
persuade	1
you	1
to	1
follow	1
my	1
example	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
turn	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
refreshing	1
after	1
sitting	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
one	1
attitude	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
surprised	1
but	1
agreed	1
to	1
it	1
immediately	1
miss	1
bingley	1
succeeded	1
no	1
less	1
in	1
the	1
real	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
civility	1
mr	1
darcy	1
looked	1
up	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
awake	1
to	1
the	1
novelty	1
of	1
attention	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
as	1
elizabeth	1
herself	1
could	1
be	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
closed	1
his	1
book	1
he	1
was	1
directly	1
invited	1
to	1
join	1
their	1
party	1
but	1
he	1
declined	1
it	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
imagine	1
but	1
two	1
motives	1
for	1
their	1
choosing	1
to	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
together	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
which	1
motives	1
his	1
joining	1
them	1
would	1
interfere	1
what	1
could	1
he	1
mean	1
she	1
was	1
dying	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
his	1
meaning	1
and	1
asked	1
elizabeth	1
whether	1
she	1
could	1
at	1
all	1
understand	1
him	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
was	1
her	1
answer	1
but	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
he	1
means	1
to	1
be	1
severe	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
surest	1
way	1
of	1
disappointing	1
him	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
ask	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
miss	1
bingley	1
however	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
disappointing	1
mr	1
darcy	1
in	1
anything	1
and	1
persevered	1
therefore	1
in	1
requiring	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
motives	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection	1
to	1
explaining	1
them	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
you	1
either	1
choose	1
this	1
method	1
of	1
passing	1
the	1
evening	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
confidence	1
and	1
have	1
secret	1
affairs	1
to	1
discuss	1
or	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
conscious	1
that	1
your	1
figures	1
appear	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
advantage	1
in	1
walking	1
if	1
the	1
first	1
i	1
would	1
be	1
completely	1
in	1
your	1
way	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
second	1
i	1
can	1
admire	1
you	1
much	1
better	1
as	1
i	1
sit	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
oh	1
shocking	1
cried	1
miss	1
bingley	1
i	1
never	1
heard	1
anything	1
so	1
abominable	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
speech	1
nothing	1
so	1
easy	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
but	1
the	1
inclination	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
we	1
can	1
all	1
plague	1
and	1
punish	1
one	1
another	1
tease	1
him	1
laugh	1
at	1
him	1
intimate	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
upon	1
my	1
honour	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
i	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
my	1
intimacy	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
taught	1
me	1
that	1
tease	1
calmness	1
of	1
manner	1
and	1
presence	1
of	1
mind	1
no	1
no	1
i	1
feel	1
he	1
may	1
defy	1
us	1
there	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
laughter	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
expose	1
ourselves	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
by	1
attempting	1
to	1
laugh	1
without	1
a	1
subject	1
mr	1
darcy	1
may	1
hug	1
himself	1
mr	1

not	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
at	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
uncommon	1
advantage	1
and	1
uncommon	1
i	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
continue	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
many	1
such	1
acquaintances	1
i	1
dearly	1
love	1

me	1
more	1
credit	1
than	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
wisest	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
men	1
nay	1
the	1
wisest	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
their	1
actions	1
may	1
be	1
rendered	1
ridiculous	1
by	1
a	1
person	1
whose	1
first	1
object	1
in	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
joke	1
certainly	1
replied	1
elizabeth	1
there	1
are	1
such	1
people	1
but	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
never	1
ridicule	1
what	1
is	1
wise	1
and	1
good	1
follies	1
and	1
nonsense	1
whims	1
and	1
inconsistencies	1
do	1
divert	1
me	1
i	1
own	1
and	1
i	1
laugh	1
at	1
them	1
whenever	1
i	1
can	1
but	1
these	1
i	1
suppose	1
are	1
precisely	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
without	1
perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
for	1
anyone	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
avoid	1
those	1
weaknesses	1
which	1
often	1
expose	1
a	1
strong	1
understanding	1
to	1
ridicule	1
such	1
as	1
vanity	1
and	1
pride	1
yes	1
vanity	1
is	1
a	1
weakness	1
indeed	1
but	1
pride	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
superiority	1
of	1
mind	1
pride	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
under	1
good	1
regulation	1

your	1

and	1
pray	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
i	1
am	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
by	1
it	1
that	1

no	1

no	1

too	1

the	1

about	1
with	1
every	1

is	1

you	1

your	1

really	1
cannot	1

at	1
it	1
you	1

in	1

evil	1
a	1

which	1
not	1

the	1
next	1

to	1
their	1
mother	1
to	1
beg	1
that	1
the	1
carriage	1
might	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
but	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
who	1
had	1
calculated	1
on	1
her	1
daughters	1
remaining	1
at	1
netherfield	1
till	1
the	1
following	1
tuesday	1
which	1
would	1
exactly	1
finish	1
jane	1

week	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1

them	1
with	1
pleasure	1
before	1
her	1
answer	1
therefore	1
was	1
not	1
propitious	1
at	1
least	1
not	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
wishes	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
sent	1
them	1
word	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
before	1
tuesday	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
postscript	1
it	1
was	1
added	1
that	1
if	1
mr	1
bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
pressed	1
them	1
to	1
stay	1
longer	1
she	1
could	1
spare	1
them	1
very	1
well	1
against	1
staying	1
longer	1
however	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
positively	1
resolved	1
nor	1
did	1
she	1
much	1
expect	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
asked	1
and	1
fearful	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
as	1
being	1
considered	1
as	1
intruding	1
themselves	1
needlessly	1
long	1
she	1
urged	1
jane	1
to	1
borrow	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
carriage	1
immediately	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
their	1
original	1
design	1
of	1
leaving	1
netherfield	1
that	1
morning	1
should	1
be	1
mentioned	1
and	1
the	1
request	1
made	1
the	1
communication	1
excited	1
many	1
professions	1
of	1
concern	1
and	1
enough	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
wishing	1
them	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
least	1
till	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
jane	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
morrow	1
their	1
going	1
was	1
deferred	1
miss	1
bingley	1
was	1
then	1
sorry	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
proposed	1
the	1
delay	1
for	1
her	1
jealousy	1
and	1
dislike	1
of	1
one	1
sister	1
much	1
exceeded	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
heard	1
with	1
real	1
sorrow	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
so	1
soon	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
miss	1
bennet	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
safe	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
recovered	1
but	1
jane	1
was	1
firm	1
where	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
to	1
mr	1
darcy	1
it	1
was	1
welcome	1
intelligence	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
netherfield	1
long	1
enough	1
she	1
attracted	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
liked	1
and	1
miss	1
bingley	1
was	1
uncivil	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
more	1
teasing	1
than	1
usual	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
wisely	1
resolved	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
careful	1
that	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
admiration	1
should	1
now	1
escape	1
him	1
nothing	1
that	1
could	1
elevate	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
influencing	1
his	1
felicity	1
sensible	1
that	1
if	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
had	1
been	1
suggested	1
his	1
behaviour	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
must	1
have	1
material	1
weight	1
in	1
confirming	1
or	1
crushing	1
it	1
steady	1
to	1
his	1
purpose	1
he	1
scarcely	1
spoke	1
ten	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
saturday	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
left	1
by	1
themselves	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
he	1
adhered	1
most	1
conscientiously	1
to	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
on	1
sunday	1
after	1
morning	1
service	1
the	1
separation	1
so	1
agreeable	1
to	1
almost	1
all	1
took	1
place	1
miss	1
bingley	1
s	1
civility	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
increased	1
at	1
last	1
very	1
rapidly	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
jane	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
parted	1
after	1
assuring	1
the	1
latter	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
it	1
would	1
always	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
either	1
at	1
longbourn	1
or	1
netherfield	1
and	1
embracing	1
her	1
most	1
tenderly	1
she	1
even	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
former	1
elizabeth	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
liveliest	1
of	1
spirits	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
welcomed	1
home	1
very	1
cordially	1
by	1
their	1
mother	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
wondered	1
at	1
their	1
coming	1
and	1
thought	1
them	1
very	1
wrong	1
to	1
give	1
so	1
much	1
trouble	1
and	1
was	1
sure	1
jane	1
would	1
have	1
caught	1
cold	1
again	1
but	1
their	1
father	1
though	1
very	1
laconic	1
in	1
his	1
expressions	1
of	1
pleasure	1
was	1
really	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
their	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
circle	1
the	1
evening	1
conversation	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
assembled	1
had	1
lost	1
much	1
of	1
its	1
animation	1
and	1
almost	1
all	1
its	1
sense	1
by	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
jane	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
they	1
found	1
mary	1
as	1
usual	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
thorough	1
bass	1
and	1
human	1
nature	1
and	1
had	1
some	1
extracts	1
to	1
admire	1
and	1
some	1
new	1
observations	1
of	1
threadbare	1
morality	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
catherine	1
and	1
lydia	1
had	1
information	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
sort	1
much	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
and	1
much	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
since	1
the	1
preceding	1
wednesday	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
had	1
dined	1
lately	1
with	1
their	1
uncle	1
a	1
private	1
had	1
been	1
flogged	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
actually	1
been	1
hinted	1
that	1

was	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married	1

my	1

said	1
mr	1
bennet	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
breakfast	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
ordered	1
a	1
good	1
dinner	1
to	1
day	1
because	1
i	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
expect	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
our	1
family	1
party	1
who	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
nobody	1
that	1
is	1
coming	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
unless	1
charlotte	1
lucas	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
my	1
dinners	1
are	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
she	1
often	1
sees	1
such	1
at	1
home	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
whom	1
i	1
speak	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
stranger	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
s	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
stranger	1
it	1
is	1
mr	1
bingley	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
well	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
extremely	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
mr	1
bingley	1
but	1
good	1
lord	1
how	1
unlucky	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1

to	1
be	1
got	1
to	1
day	1

i	1
must	1
speak	1
to	1
hill	1
this	1
moment	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
mr	1
bingley	1
said	1
her	1
husband	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
person	1
whom	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
this	1
roused	1
a	1
general	1
astonishment	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
eagerly	1
questioned	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
five	1
daughters	1
at	1
once	1
after	1
amusing	1
himself	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
their	1
curiosity	1
he	1
thus	1
explained	1
about	1
a	1
month	1
ago	1
i	1
received	1
this	1
letter	1
and	1
about	1
a	1
fortnight	1
ago	1
i	1
answered	1
it	1
for	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
some	1
delicacy	1
and	1
requiring	1
early	1
attention	1
it	1
is	1
from	1
my	1
cousin	1
mr	1
collins	1
who	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
dead	1
may	1
turn	1
you	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
pleases	1
oh	1
my	1
dear	1
cried	1
his	1
wife	1
i	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
mentioned	1
pray	1
do	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
odious	1
man	1
i	1
do	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
hardest	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
your	1
estate	1
should	1
be	1
entailed	1
away	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
children	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
you	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
tried	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
about	1
it	1
jane	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
an	1
entail	1
they	1
had	1
often	1
attempted	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
before	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
on	1
which	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
she	1
continued	1
to	1
rail	1
bitterly	1
against	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
settling	1
an	1
estate	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
five	1
daughters	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
nobody	1
cared	1
anything	1
about	1
it	1
certainly	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
iniquitous	1
affair	1
said	1
mr	1
bennet	1
and	1
nothing	1
can	1
clear	1
mr	1
collins	1
from	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
inheriting	1
longbourn	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
listen	1
to	1
his	1
letter	1
you	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
softened	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
expressing	1
himself	1
no	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
impertinent	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
you	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
very	1
hypocritical	1
i	1
hate	1
such	1
false	1
friends	1
why	1
could	1
he	1
not	1
keep	1
on	1
quarreling	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
did	1
before	1
him	1
why	1
indeed	1
he	1
does	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
filial	1
scruples	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
hunsford	1
near	1
westerham	1
kent	1
15th	1
october	1
dear	1
sir	1
the	1
disagreement	1
subsisting	1
between	1
yourself	1
and	1
my	1
late	1
honoured	1
father	1
always	1
gave	1
me	1
much	1
uneasiness	1
and	1
since	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
lose	1
him	1
i	1
have	1
frequently	1
wished	1
to	1
heal	1
the	1
breach	1
but	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
i	1
was	1
kept	1
back	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
doubts	1
fearing	1
lest	1
it	1
might	1
seem	1
disrespectful	1
to	1
his	1
memory	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
anyone	1
with	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
always	1
pleased	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
variance	1
there	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
my	1
mind	1
however	1
is	1
now	1
made	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
for	1
having	1
received	1
ordination	1
at	1
easter	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
distinguished	1
by	1
the	1
patronage	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
honourable	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
widow	1
of	1
sir	1
lewis	1
de	1
bourgh	1
whose	1
bounty	1
and	1
beneficence	1
has	1
preferred	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
valuable	1
rectory	1
of	1
this	1
parish	1
where	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
earnest	1
endeavour	1
to	1
demean	1
myself	1
with	1
grateful	1
respect	1
towards	1
her	1
ladyship	1
and	1
be	1
ever	1
ready	1
to	1
perform	1
those	1
rites	1
and	1
ceremonies	1
which	1
are	1
instituted	1
by	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
england	1
as	1
a	1
clergyman	1
moreover	1
i	1
feel	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
promote	1
and	1
establish	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
peace	1
in	1
all	1
families	1
within	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
my	1
influence	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
grounds	1
i	1
flatter	1
myself	1
that	1
my	1
present	1
overtures	1
are	1
highly	1
commendable	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
next	1
in	1
the	1
entail	1
of	1
longbourn	1
estate	1
will	1
be	1
kindly	1
overlooked	1
on	1
your	1
side	1
and	1
not	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
reject	1
the	1
offered	1
olive	1
branch	1
i	1
cannot	1
be	1
otherwise	1
than	1
concerned	1
at	1
being	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
injuring	1
your	1
amiable	1
daughters	1
and	1
beg	1
leave	1
to	1
apologise	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
readiness	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
every	1
possible	1
amends	1
but	1
of	1
this	1
hereafter	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
receive	1
me	1
into	1
your	1
house	1
i	1
propose	1
myself	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
waiting	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
family	1
monday	1
november	1
18th	1
by	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
shall	1
probably	1
trespass	1
on	1
your	1
hospitality	1
till	1
the	1
saturday	1
se	1
ennight	1
following	1
which	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
without	1
any	1
inconvenience	1
as	1
lady	1
catherine	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
objecting	1
to	1
my	1
occasional	1
absence	1
on	1
a	1
sunday	1
provided	1
that	1
some	1
other	1
clergyman	1
is	1
engaged	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
i	1
remain	1
dear	1
sir	1
with	1
respectful	1
compliments	1
to	1
your	1
lady	1
and	1
daughters	1
your	1
well	1
wisher	1
and	1
friend	1
william	1
collins	1
at	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
therefore	1
we	1
may	1
expect	1
this	1
peace	1
making	1
gentleman	1
said	1
mr	1
bennet	1
as	1
he	1
folded	1
up	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
conscientious	1
and	1
polite	1
young	1
man	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
and	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
will	1
prove	1
a	1
valuable	1
acquaintance	1
especially	1
if	1
lady	1
catherine	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
indulgent	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
again	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
about	1
the	1
girls	1
however	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
disposed	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
any	1
amends	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
discourage	1
him	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
said	1
jane	1
to	1
guess	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
he	1
can	1
mean	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
the	1
atonement	1
he	1
thinks	1
our	1
due	1
the	1
wish	1
is	1
certainly	1
to	1
his	1
credit	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
chiefly	1
struck	1
by	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
deference	1
for	1
lady	1
catherine	1
and	1
his	1
kind	1
intention	1
of	1
christening	1
marrying	1
and	1
burying	1
his	1
parishioners	1
whenever	1
it	1
were	1
required	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
oddity	1
i	1
think	1
said	1
she	1
i	1
cannot	1
make	1
him	1
out	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
very	1
pompous	1
in	1
his	1
style	1
and	1
what	1
can	1
he	1
mean	1
by	1
apologising	1
for	1
being	1
next	1
in	1
the	1
entail	1
we	1
cannot	1
suppose	1
he	1
would	1
help	1
it	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
sensible	1
man	1
sir	1
no	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
think	1
not	1
i	1
have	1
great	1
hopes	1
of	1
finding	1
him	1
quite	1
the	1
reverse	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
servility	1
and	1
self	1
importance	1
in	1
his	1
letter	1
which	1
promises	1
well	1
i	1
am	1
impatient	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
composition	1
said	1
mary	1
the	1
letter	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
defective	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
branch	1
perhaps	1
is	1
not	1
wholly	1
new	1
yet	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
expressed	1
to	1
catherine	1
and	1
lydia	1
neither	1
the	1
letter	1
nor	1
its	1
writer	1
were	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
interesting	1
it	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
impossible	1
that	1
their	1
cousin	1
should	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
scarlet	1
coat	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
some	1
weeks	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
pleasure	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
colour	1
as	1
for	1
their	1
mother	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
letter	1
had	1
done	1
away	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
ill	1
will	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
composure	1
which	1
astonished	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
daughters	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
punctual	1
to	1
his	1
time	1
and	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
great	1
politeness	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
mr	1
bennet	1
indeed	1
said	1
little	1
but	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
ready	1
enough	1
to	1
talk	1
and	1
mr	1
collins	1
seemed	1
neither	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
encouragement	1
nor	1
inclined	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
himself	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
heavy	1
looking	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
his	1
air	1
was	1
grave	1
and	1
stately	1
and	1
his	1
manners	1
were	1
very	1
formal	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
seated	1
before	1
he	1
complimented	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
on	1
having	1
so	1
fine	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
daughters	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
much	1
of	1
their	1
beauty	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
fame	1
had	1
fallen	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
added	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
her	1
seeing	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
disposed	1
of	1
in	1
marriage	1
this	1
gallantry	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
hearers	1
but	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
who	1
quarreled	1
with	1
no	1
compliments	1
answered	1
most	1
readily	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
kind	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
and	1
i	1
wish	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
it	1
may	1
prove	1
so	1
for	1
else	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
destitute	1
enough	1
things	1
are	1
settled	1
so	1
oddly	1
you	1
allude	1
perhaps	1
to	1
the	1
entail	1
of	1
this	1
estate	1
ah	1
sir	1
i	1
do	1
indeed	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
grievous	1
affair	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
girls	1
you	1
must	1
confess	1
not	1
that	1
i	1
mean	1
to	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
such	1
things	1
i	1
know	1
are	1
all	1
chance	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
knowing	1
how	1
estates	1
will	1
go	1
when	1
once	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
entailed	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sensible	1
madam	1
of	1
the	1
hardship	1
to	1
my	1
fair	1
cousins	1
and	1
could	1
say	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
cautious	1
of	1
appearing	1
forward	1
and	1
precipitate	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
assure	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
that	1
i	1
come	1
prepared	1
to	1
admire	1
them	1
at	1
present	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
more	1
but	1
perhaps	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
better	1
acquainted	1
he	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
a	1
summons	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
smiled	1
on	1
each	1
other	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
objects	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
admiration	1
the	1
hall	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
furniture	1
were	1
examined	1
and	1
praised	1
and	1
his	1
commendation	1
of	1
everything	1
would	1
have	1
touched	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
s	1
heart	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
mortifying	1
supposition	1
of	1
his	1
viewing	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
future	1
property	1
the	1
dinner	1
too	1
in	1
its	1
turn	1
was	1
highly	1
admired	1
and	1
he	1
begged	1
to	1
know	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
his	1
fair	1
cousins	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
its	1
cooking	1
was	1
owing	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
set	1
right	1
there	1
by	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
who	1
assured	1
him	1
with	1
some	1
asperity	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
good	1
cook	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
daughters	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
he	1
begged	1
pardon	1
for	1
having	1
displeased	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
softened	1
tone	1
she	1
declared	1
herself	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
offended	1
but	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
apologise	1
for	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
chapter	1
14	1
during	1
dinner	1
mr	1
bennet	1
scarcely	1
spoke	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
withdrawn	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
guest	1
and	1
therefore	1
started	1
a	1
subject	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
expected	1
him	1
to	1
shine	1
by	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
very	1
fortunate	1
in	1
his	1
patroness	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
s	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
wishes	1
and	1
consideration	1
for	1
his	1
comfort	1
appeared	1
very	1
remarkable	1
mr	1
bennet	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
chosen	1
better	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
eloquent	1
in	1
her	1
praise	1
the	1
subject	1
elevated	1
him	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
solemnity	1
of	1
manner	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
important	1
aspect	1
he	1
protested	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
witnessed	1
such	1
behaviour	1
in	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
rank	1
such	1
affability	1
and	1
condescension	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
experienced	1
from	1
lady	1
catherine	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
graciously	1
pleased	1
to	1
approve	1
of	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
discourses	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
preaching	1
before	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
also	1
asked	1
him	1
twice	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
rosings	1
and	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
only	1
the	1
saturday	1
before	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
pool	1
of	1
quadrille	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
lady	1
catherine	1
was	1
reckoned	1
proud	1
by	1
many	1
people	1
he	1
knew	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
anything	1
but	1
affability	1
in	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
gentleman	1
she	1
made	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection	1
to	1
his	1
joining	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
nor	1
to	1
his	1
leaving	1
the	1
parish	1
occasionally	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
two	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
relations	1
she	1
had	1
even	1
condescended	1
to	1
advise	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
provided	1
he	1
chose	1
with	1
discretion	1
and	1
had	1
once	1
paid	1
him	1
a	1
visit	1
in	1
his	1
humble	1
parsonage	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
perfectly	1
approved	1
all	1
the	1
alterations	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
making	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
vouchsafed	1
to	1
suggest	1
some	1
herself	1
some	1
shelves	1
in	1
the	1
closet	1
up	1
stairs	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
proper	1
and	1
civil	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
said	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
and	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
woman	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
great	1
ladies	1
in	1
general	1
are	1
not	1
more	1
like	1
her	1
does	1
she	1
live	1
near	1
you	1
sir	1
the	1
garden	1
in	1
which	1
stands	1
my	1
humble	1
abode	1
is	1
separated	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
lane	1
from	1
rosings	1
park	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
residence	1
i	1
think	1
you	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
sir	1
has	1
she	1
any	1
family	1
she	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
daughter	1
the	1
heiress	1
of	1
rosings	1
and	1
of	1
very	1
extensive	1
property	1
ah	1
said	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
shaking	1
her	1
head	1
then	1
she	1
is	1
better	1
off	1
than	1
many	1
girls	1
and	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
young	1
lady	1
is	1
she	1
is	1
she	1
handsome	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
charming	1
young	1
lady	1
indeed	1
lady	1
catherine	1
herself	1
says	1
that	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
true	1
beauty	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
is	1
far	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
handsomest	1
of	1
her	1
sex	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
features	1
which	1
marks	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
of	1
distinguished	1
birth	1
she	1
is	1
unfortunately	1
of	1
a	1
sickly	1
constitution	1
which	1
has	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
making	1
that	1
progress	1
in	1
many	1
accomplishments	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
otherwise	1
failed	1
of	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
informed	1
by	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
superintended	1
her	1
education	1
and	1
who	1
still	1
resides	1
with	1
them	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
perfectly	1
amiable	1
and	1
often	1
condescends	1
to	1
drive	1
by	1
my	1
humble	1
abode	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
phaeton	1
and	1
ponies	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
presented	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
her	1
name	1
among	1
the	1
ladies	1
at	1
court	1
her	1
indifferent	1
state	1
of	1
health	1
unhappily	1
prevents	1
her	1
being	1
in	1
town	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
means	1
as	1
i	1
told	1
lady	1
catherine	1
one	1
day	1
has	1
deprived	1
the	1
british	1
court	1
of	1
its	1
brightest	1
ornament	1
her	1
ladyship	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
imagine	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
happy	1
on	1
every	1
occasion	1
to	1
offer	1
those	1
little	1
delicate	1
compliments	1
which	1
are	1
always	1
acceptable	1
to	1
ladies	1
i	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
observed	1
to	1
lady	1
catherine	1
that	1
her	1
charming	1
daughter	1
seemed	1
born	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
duchess	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
elevated	1
rank	1
instead	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
consequence	1
would	1
be	1
adorned	1
by	1
her	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
little	1
things	1
which	1
please	1
her	1
ladyship	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
attention	1
which	1
i	1
conceive	1
myself	1
peculiarly	1
bound	1
to	1
pay	1
you	1
judge	1
very	1
properly	1
said	1
mr	1
bennet	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
happy	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
possess	1
the	1
talent	1
of	1
flattering	1
with	1
delicacy	1
may	1
i	1
ask	1
whether	1
these	1
pleasing	1
attentions	1
proceed	1
from	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
or	1
are	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
previous	1
study	1
they	1
arise	1
chiefly	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
passing	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
though	1
i	1
sometimes	1
amuse	1
myself	1
with	1
suggesting	1
and	1
arranging	1
such	1
little	1
elegant	1
compliments	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
adapted	1
to	1
ordinary	1
occasions	1
i	1
always	1
wish	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
as	1
unstudied	1
an	1
air	1
as	1
possible	1
mr	1
bennet	1
s	1
expectations	1
were	1
fully	1
answered	1
his	1
cousin	1
was	1
as	1
absurd	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
keenest	1
enjoyment	1
maintaining	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
most	1
resolute	1
composure	1
of	1
countenance	1
and	1
except	1
in	1
an	1
occasional	1
glance	1
at	1
elizabeth	1
requiring	1
no	1
partner	1
in	1
his	1
pleasure	1
by	1
tea	1
time	1
however	1
the	1
dose	1
had	1
been	1
enough	1
and	1
mr	1
bennet	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
guest	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
again	1
and	1
when	1
tea	1
was	1
over	1
glad	1
to	1
invite	1
him	1
to	1
read	1
aloud	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
mr	1
collins	1
readily	1
assented	1
and	1
a	1
book	1
was	1
produced	1
but	1
on	1
beholding	1
it	1
for	1
everything	1
announced	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
a	1
circulating	1
library	1
he	1
started	1
back	1
and	1
begging	1
pardon	1
protested	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
read	1
novels	1
kitty	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
lydia	1
exclaimed	1
other	1
books	1
were	1
produced	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
deliberation	1
he	1
chose	1
fordyce	1
s	1
sermons	1
lydia	1
gaped	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
volume	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
very	1
monotonous	1
solemnity	1
read	1
three	1
pages	1
she	1
interrupted	1
him	1
with	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
mamma	1
that	1
my	1
uncle	1
phillips	1
talks	1
of	1
turning	1
away	1
richard	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
colonel	1
forster	1
will	1
hire	1
him	1
my	1
aunt	1
told	1
me	1
so	1
herself	1
on	1
saturday	1
i	1
shall	1
walk	1
to	1
meryton	1
to	1
morrow	1
to	1
hear	1
more	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
when	1
mr	1
denny	1
comes	1
back	1
from	1
town	1
lydia	1
was	1
bid	1
by	1
her	1
two	1
eldest	1
sisters	1
to	1
hold	1
her	1
tongue	1
but	1
mr	1
collins	1
much	1
offended	1
laid	1
aside	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
observed	1
how	1
little	1
young	1
ladies	1
are	1
interested	1
by	1
books	1
of	1
a	1
serious	1
stamp	1
though	1
written	1
solely	1
for	1
their	1
benefit	1
it	1
amazes	1
me	1
i	1
confess	1
for	1
certainly	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
nothing	1
so	1
advantageous	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
instruction	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
no	1
longer	1
importune	1
my	1
young	1
cousin	1
then	1
turning	1
to	1
mr	1
bennet	1
he	1
offered	1
himself	1
as	1
his	1
antagonist	1
at	1
backgammon	1
mr	1
bennet	1
accepted	1
the	1
challenge	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
acted	1
very	1
wisely	1
in	1
leaving	1
the	1
girls	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
trifling	1
amusements	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
apologised	1
most	1
civilly	1
for	1
lydia	1
s	1
interruption	1
and	1
promised	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
occur	1
again	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
resume	1
his	1
book	1
but	1
mr	1
collins	1
after	1
assuring	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
bore	1
his	1
young	1
cousin	1
no	1
ill	1
will	1
and	1
should	1
never	1
resent	1
her	1
behaviour	1
as	1
any	1
affront	1
seated	1
himself	1
at	1
another	1
table	1
with	1
mr	1
bennet	1
and	1
prepared	1
for	1
backgammon	1
chapter	1
15	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
sensible	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
deficiency	1
of	1
nature	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
little	1
assisted	1
by	1
education	1
or	1
society	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
having	1
been	1
spent	1
under	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
an	1
illiterate	1
and	1
miserly	1
father	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
universities	1
he	1
had	1
merely	1
kept	1
the	1
necessary	1
terms	1
without	1
forming	1
at	1
it	1
any	1
useful	1
acquaintance	1
the	1
subjection	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
originally	1
great	1
humility	1
of	1
manner	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
counteracted	1
by	1
the	1
self	1
conceit	1
of	1
a	1
weak	1
head	1
living	1
in	1
retirement	1
and	1
the	1
consequential	1
feelings	1
of	1
early	1
and	1
unexpected	1
prosperity	1

fortunate	1
chance	1

was	1
vacant	1
and	1
the	1
respect	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
high	1
rank	1
and	1
his	1
veneration	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
patroness	1
mingling	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
opinion	1
of	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
authority	1
as	1
a	1
clergyman	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
as	1
a	1
rector	1
made	1
him	1
altogether	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
pride	1
and	1
obsequiousness	1
self	1

and	1
humility	1

now	1
a	1
good	1

in	1
seeking	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
the	1
longbourn	1
family	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
wife	1
in	1
view	1
as	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
choose	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
as	1
handsome	1
and	1
amiable	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
represented	1
by	1
common	1
report	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
plan	1
of	1
amends	1
of	1
atonement	1
for	1
inheriting	1
their	1
father	1
s	1
estate	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
an	1
excellent	1
one	1
full	1
of	1
eligibility	1
and	1
suitableness	1
and	1
excessively	1
generous	1
and	1
disinterested	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
part	1

plan	1
did	1
not	1
vary	1
on	1
seeing	1
them	1

lovely	1
face	1
confirmed	1
his	1
views	1
and	1
established	1
all	1
his	1
strictest	1
notions	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
seniority	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
evening	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
settled	1
choice	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1

made	1
an	1
alteration	1
for	1
in	1

of	1
an	1
hour	1

à	1

with	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
before	1
breakfast	1
a	1
conversation	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
parsonage	1
house	1
and	1
leading	1
naturally	1
to	1
the	1
avowal	1
of	1
his	1
hopes	1
that	1
a	1
mistress	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
longbourn	1
produced	1
from	1
her	1
amid	1
very	1
complaisant	1
smiles	1
and	1
general	1
encouragement	1
a	1
caution	1
against	1
the	1
very	1
jane	1

fixed	1
on	1
as	1

her	1
younger	1

could	1
not	1

upon	1

mr	1
collins	1

only	1
to	1
change	1
from	1
jane	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
done	1
done	1
while	1
mrs	1

was	1
stirring	1

fire	1

mrs	1

treasured	1
up	1
the	1
hint	1
and	1
trusted	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
soon	1
have	1
two	1
daughters	1
married	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
was	1
now	1
high	1
in	1
her	1
good	1
graces	1
lydia	1
s	1
intention	1
of	1
walking	1
to	1
meryton	1
was	1
not	1
forgotten	1
every	1
sister	1
except	1
mary	1
agreed	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
to	1
attend	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
mr	1
bennet	1
who	1
was	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
have	1
his	1
library	1
to	1
himself	1
for	1
thither	1
mr	1
collins	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
after	1
breakfast	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
would	1
continue	1
nominally	1
engaged	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
folios	1
in	1
the	1
collection	1
but	1
really	1
talking	1
to	1
mr	1
bennet	1
with	1
little	1
cessation	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
at	1
hunsford	1
such	1
doings	1
discomposed	1
mr	1
bennet	1
exceedingly	1
in	1
his	1
library	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
sure	1
of	1
leisure	1
and	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
though	1
prepared	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
elizabeth	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
folly	1
and	1
conceit	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
them	1
there	1
his	1
civility	1
therefore	1
was	1
most	1
prompt	1
in	1
inviting	1
mr	1
collins	1
to	1
join	1
his	1
daughters	1
in	1
their	1
walk	1
and	1
mr	1
collins	1
being	1
in	1
fact	1
much	1
better	1
fitted	1
for	1
a	1
walker	1
than	1
a	1
reader	1
was	1
extremely	1
pleased	1
to	1
close	1
his	1
large	1
book	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
pompous	1
nothings	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
civil	1
assents	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
cousins	1
their	1
time	1
passed	1
till	1
they	1
entered	1
meryton	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
ones	1
was	1
then	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
be	1
gained	1
by	1
him	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
immediately	1
wandering	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
very	1
smart	1
bonnet	1
indeed	1
or	1
a	1
really	1
new	1
muslin	1
in	1
a	1
shop	1
window	1
could	1
recall	1
them	1
but	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
every	1
lady	1
was	1
soon	1
caught	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
of	1
most	1
gentlemanlike	1
appearance	1
walking	1
with	1
another	1
officer	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
officer	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
mr	1
denny	1
concerning	1
whose	1
return	1
from	1
london	1
lydia	1
came	1
to	1
inquire	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
all	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
stranger	1
s	1
air	1
all	1
wondered	1
who	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
and	1
kitty	1
and	1
lydia	1
determined	1
if	1
possible	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
street	1
under	1
pretense	1
of	1
wanting	1
something	1
in	1
an	1
opposite	1
shop	1
and	1
fortunately	1
had	1
just	1
gained	1
the	1
pavement	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
turning	1
back	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
mr	1
denny	1
addressed	1
them	1
directly	1
and	1
entreated	1
permission	1
to	1
introduce	1
his	1
friend	1
mr	1
wickham	1
who	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
from	1
town	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
say	1
had	1
accepted	1
a	1
commission	1
in	1
their	1
corps	1
this	1
was	1
exactly	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
wanted	1
only	1
regimentals	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
completely	1
charming	1
his	1
appearance	1
was	1
greatly	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
beauty	1
a	1
fine	1
countenance	1
a	1
good	1
figure	1
and	1
very	1
pleasing	1
address	1
the	1
introduction	1
was	1
followed	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
by	1
a	1
happy	1
readiness	1
of	1
conversation	1
a	1
readiness	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
perfectly	1
correct	1
and	1
unassuming	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
were	1
still	1
standing	1
and	1
talking	1
together	1
very	1
agreeably	1
when	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
horses	1
drew	1
their	1
notice	1
and	1
darcy	1
and	1
bingley	1
were	1
seen	1
riding	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
on	1
distinguishing	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
group	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
came	1
directly	1
towards	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
the	1
usual	1
civilities	1
bingley	1
was	1
the	1
principal	1
spokesman	1
and	1
miss	1
bennet	1
the	1
principal	1
object	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
longbourn	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
her	1
mr	1
darcy	1
corroborated	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
determine	1
not	1
to	1
fix	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
elizabeth	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
suddenly	1
arrested	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
happening	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
both	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
was	1
all	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
both	1
changed	1
colour	1
one	1
looked	1
white	1
the	1
other	1
red	1
mr	1
wickham	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
touched	1
his	1
hat	1
a	1
salutation	1
which	1
mr	1
darcy	1
just	1
deigned	1
to	1
return	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
long	1
to	1
know	1
in	1
another	1
minute	1
mr	1
bingley	1
but	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
have	1
noticed	1
what	1
passed	1
took	1
leave	1
and	1
rode	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
mr	1
denny	1
and	1
mr	1
wickham	1
walked	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
mr	1
phillip	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
their	1
bows	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
miss	1
lydia	1
s	1
pressing	1
entreaties	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
s	1
throwing	1
up	1
the	1
parlour	1
window	1
and	1
loudly	1
seconding	1
the	1
invitation	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
was	1
always	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
nieces	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
eldest	1
from	1
their	1
recent	1
absence	1
were	1
particularly	1
welcome	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
eagerly	1
expressing	1
her	1
surprise	1
at	1
their	1
sudden	1
return	1
home	1
which	1
as	1
their	1
own	1
carriage	1
had	1
not	1
fetched	1
them	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
nothing	1
about	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
to	1
see	1
mr	1
jones	1
s	1
shop	1
boy	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
who	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
send	1
any	1
more	1
draughts	1
to	1
netherfield	1
because	1
the	1
miss	1
bennets	1
were	1
come	1
away	1
when	1
her	1
civility	1
was	1
claimed	1
towards	1
mr	1
collins	1
by	1
jane	1
s	1
introduction	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
very	1
best	1
politeness	1
which	1
he	1
returned	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
more	1
apologising	1
for	1
his	1
intrusion	1
without	1
any	1
previous	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
her	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
flattering	1
himself	1
however	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
relationship	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
notice	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
was	1
quite	1
awed	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
excess	1
of	1
good	1
breeding	1
but	1
her	1
contemplation	1
of	1
one	1
stranger	1
was	1
soon	1
put	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
by	1
exclamations	1
and	1
inquiries	1
about	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
whom	1
however	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
tell	1
her	1
nieces	1
what	1
they	1
already	1
knew	1
that	1
mr	1
denny	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
from	1
london	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
lieutenant	1
s	1
commission	1
in	1
the	1
shire	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
him	1
the	1
last	1
hour	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
had	1
mr	1
wickham	1
appeared	1
kitty	1
and	1
lydia	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
continued	1
the	1
occupation	1
but	1
unluckily	1
no	1
one	1
passed	1
windows	1
now	1
except	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
who	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
stranger	1
were	1
become	1
stupid	1
disagreeable	1
fellows	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
phillipses	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
their	1
aunt	1
promised	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
husband	1
call	1
on	1
mr	1
wickham	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
invitation	1
also	1
if	1
the	1
family	1
from	1
longbourn	1
would	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
this	1
was	1
agreed	1
to	1
and	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
protested	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
nice	1
comfortable	1
noisy	1
game	1
of	1
lottery	1
tickets	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
hot	1
supper	1
afterwards	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
such	1
delights	1
was	1
very	1
cheering	1
and	1
they	1
parted	1
in	1
mutual	1
good	1
spirits	1
mr	1
collins	1
repeated	1
his	1
apologies	1
in	1
quitting	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
was	1
assured	1
with	1
unwearying	1
civility	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
perfectly	1
needless	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
home	1
elizabeth	1
related	1
to	1
jane	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
pass	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
but	1
though	1
jane	1
would	1
have	1
defended	1
either	1
or	1
both	1
had	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
explain	1
such	1
behaviour	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
mr	1
collins	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
highly	1
gratified	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
by	1
admiring	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
s	1
manners	1
and	1
politeness	1
he	1
protested	1
that	1
except	1
lady	1
catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
more	1
elegant	1
woman	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
civility	1
but	1
even	1
pointedly	1
included	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
invitation	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
evening	1
although	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
her	1
before	1
something	1
he	1
supposed	1
might	1
be	1
attributed	1
to	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
them	1
but	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
attention	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
chapter	1
16	1
as	1
no	1

to	1
the	1

scruples	1
of	1
leaving	1
mr	1
and	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
evening	1
during	1
his	1
visit	1
were	1
most	1
steadily	1
resisted	1
the	1
coach	1
conveyed	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
five	1
cousins	1
at	1
a	1
suitable	1
hour	1
to	1
meryton	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
hearing	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
that	1
mr	1
wickham	1
had	1
accepted	1
their	1
uncle	1
s	1
invitation	1
and	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
when	1
this	1
information	1
was	1
given	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
taken	1
their	1
seats	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
look	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
admire	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
size	1
and	1
furniture	1
of	1
the	1
apartment	1
that	1
he	1
declared	1
he	1
might	1
almost	1
have	1
supposed	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
summer	1
breakfast	1
parlour	1
at	1
rosings	1
a	1
comparison	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
convey	1
much	1
gratification	1
but	1
when	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
understood	1
from	1
him	1
what	1
rosings	1
was	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
its	1
proprietor	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
s	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
chimney	1
piece	1
alone	1
had	1
cost	1
eight	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
compliment	1
and	1
would	1
hardly	1
have	1
resented	1
a	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
s	1
room	1
in	1
describing	1
to	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
and	1
her	1
mansion	1
with	1
occasional	1
digressions	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
humble	1
abode	1
and	1
the	1
improvements	1
it	1
was	1
receiving	1
he	1
was	1
happily	1
employed	1
until	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
joined	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
a	1
very	1
attentive	1
listener	1
whose	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
consequence	1
increased	1
with	1
what	1
she	1
heard	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
resolving	1
to	1
retail	1
it	1
all	1
among	1
her	1
neighbours	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
to	1
the	1
girls	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
their	1
cousin	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
an	1
instrument	1
and	1
examine	1
their	1
own	1
indifferent	1
imitations	1
of	1
china	1
on	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
the	1
interval	1
of	1
waiting	1
appeared	1
very	1
long	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
at	1
last	1
however	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
did	1
approach	1
and	1
when	1
mr	1
wickham	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
neither	1
been	1
seeing	1
him	1
before	1
nor	1
thinking	1
of	1
him	1
since	1
with	1
the	1
smallest	1
degree	1
of	1
unreasonable	1
admiration	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
shire	1
were	1
in	1
general	1
a	1
very	1
creditable	1
gentlemanlike	1
set	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
party	1
but	1
mr	1
wickham	1
was	1
as	1
far	1
beyond	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
person	1
countenance	1
air	1
and	1
walk	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
broad	1
faced	1
stuffy	1
uncle	1
phillips	1
breathing	1
port	1
wine	1
who	1
followed	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
mr	1
wickham	1
was	1
the	1
happy	1
man	1
towards	1
whom	1
almost	1
every	1
female	1
eye	1
was	1
turned	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
the	1
happy	1
woman	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
finally	1
seated	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
agreeable	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
immediately	1
fell	1
into	1
conversation	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
on	1
its	1
being	1
a	1
wet	1
night	1
made	1
her	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
commonest	1
dullest	1
most	1
threadbare	1
topic	1
might	1
be	1
rendered	1
interesting	1
by	1
the	1
skill	1
of	1
the	1
speaker	1
with	1
such	1
rivals	1
for	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
as	1
mr	1
wickham	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
mr	1
collins	1
seemed	1
to	1
sink	1
into	1
insignificance	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
he	1
certainly	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
at	1
intervals	1
a	1
kind	1
listener	1
in	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
and	1
was	1
by	1
her	1
watchfulness	1
most	1
abundantly	1
supplied	1
with	1
coffee	1
and	1
muffin	1
when	1
the	1
card	1
tables	1
were	1
placed	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
obliging	1
her	1
in	1
turn	1
by	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
whist	1
i	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
at	1
present	1
said	1
he	1
but	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
improve	1
myself	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
for	1
his	1
compliance	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
reason	1
mr	1
wickham	1
did	1
not	1
play	1
at	1
whist	1
and	1
with	1
ready	1
delight	1
was	1
he	1
received	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
between	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
lydia	1
at	1
first	1
there	1
seemed	1
danger	1
of	1
lydia	1
s	1
engrossing	1
him	1
entirely	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
determined	1
talker	1
but	1
being	1
likewise	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
lottery	1
tickets	1
she	1
soon	1
grew	1
too	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
game	1
too	1
eager	1
in	1
making	1
bets	1
and	1
exclaiming	1
after	1
prizes	1
to	1
have	1
attention	1
for	1
anyone	1
in	1
particular	1
allowing	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
demands	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
mr	1
wickham	1
was	1
therefore	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
willing	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
though	1
what	1
she	1
chiefly	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
mr	1
darcy	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
even	1
mention	1
that	1
gentleman	1
her	1
curiosity	1
however	1
was	1
unexpectedly	1
relieved	1
mr	1
wickham	1
began	1
the	1
subject	1
himself	1
he	1
inquired	1
how	1
far	1
netherfield	1
was	1
from	1
meryton	1
and	1
after	1
receiving	1
her	1
answer	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
hesitating	1
manner	1
how	1
long	1
mr	1
darcy	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
there	1
about	1
a	1
month	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
then	1
unwilling	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
subject	1
drop	1
added	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
large	1
property	1
in	1
derbyshire	1
i	1
understand	1
yes	1
replied	1
mr	1
wickham	1
his	1
estate	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
noble	1
one	1
a	1
clear	1
ten	1
thousand	1
per	1
annum	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
person	1
more	1
capable	1
of	1
giving	1
you	1
certain	1
information	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
than	1
myself	1
for	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
connected	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
manner	1
from	1
my	1
infancy	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
look	1
surprised	1
you	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
surprised	1
miss	1
bennet	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
assertion	1
after	1
seeing	1
as	1
you	1
probably	1
might	1
the	1
very	1
cold	1
manner	1
of	1
our	1
meeting	1
yesterday	1
are	1
you	1
much	1
acquainted	1
with	1
mr	1
darcy	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
i	1
ever	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
very	1
warmly	1
i	1
have	1
spent	1
four	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
him	1
very	1
disagreeable	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
opinion	1
said	1
wickham	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
being	1
agreeable	1
or	1
otherwise	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
qualified	1
to	1
form	1
one	1
i	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
too	1
long	1
and	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
fair	1
judge	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
impartial	1
but	1
i	1
believe	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
would	1
in	1
general	1
astonish	1
and	1
perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
express	1
it	1
quite	1
so	1
strongly	1
anywhere	1
else	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
family	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
i	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
here	1
than	1
i	1
might	1
say	1
in	1
any	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
except	1
netherfield	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
liked	1
in	1
hertfordshire	1
everybody	1
is	1
disgusted	1
with	1
his	1
pride	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
more	1
favourably	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
anyone	1
i	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
sorry	1
said	1
wickham	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
interruption	1
that	1
he	1
or	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
estimated	1
beyond	1
their	1
deserts	1
but	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
often	1
happen	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
blinded	1
by	1
his	1
fortune	1
and	1
consequence	1
or	1
frightened	1
by	1
his	1
high	1
and	1
imposing	1
manners	1
and	1
sees	1
him	1
only	1
as	1
he	1
chooses	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
i	1
should	1
take	1
him	1
even	1
on	1
my	1
slight	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
ill	1
tempered	1
man	1
wickham	1
only	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
i	1
wonder	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
opportunity	1
of	1
speaking	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
much	1
longer	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
know	1
but	1
i	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
his	1
going	1
away	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
at	1
netherfield	1
i	1
hope	1
your	1
plans	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
shire	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
affected	1
by	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
oh	1
no	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
away	1
by	1
mr	1
darcy	1
if	1
he	1
wishes	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
me	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
and	1
it	1
always	1
gives	1
me	1
pain	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
avoiding	1
him	1
but	1
what	1
i	1
might	1
proclaim	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
very	1
great	1
ill	1
usage	1
and	1
most	1
painful	1
regrets	1
at	1
his	1
being	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
his	1
father	1
miss	1
bennet	1
the	1
late	1
mr	1
darcy	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
men	1
that	1
ever	1
breathed	1
and	1
the	1
truest	1
friend	1
i	1
ever	1
had	1
and	1
i	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
this	1
mr	1
darcy	1
without	1
being	1
grieved	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
tender	1
recollections	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
myself	1
has	1
been	1
scandalous	1
but	1
i	1
verily	1
believe	1
i	1
could	1
forgive	1
him	1
anything	1
and	1
everything	1
rather	1
than	1
his	1
disappointing	1
the	1
hopes	1
and	1
disgracing	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
elizabeth	1
found	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
increase	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
but	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
it	1
prevented	1
further	1
inquiry	1
mr	1
wickham	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
on	1
more	1
general	1
topics	1
meryton	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
the	1
society	1
appearing	1
highly	1
pleased	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
seen	1
and	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
gentle	1
but	1
very	1
intelligible	1
gallantry	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
constant	1
society	1
and	1
good	1
society	1
he	1
added	1
which	1
was	1
my	1
chief	1
inducement	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
shire	1
i	1
knew	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
respectable	1
agreeable	1
corps	1
and	1
my	1
friend	1
denny	1
tempted	1
me	1
further	1
by	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
present	1
quarters	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
attentions	1
and	1
excellent	1
acquaintances	1
meryton	1
had	1
procured	1
them	1
society	1
i	1
own	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
disappointed	1
man	1
and	1
my	1
spirits	1
will	1
not	1
bear	1
solitude	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
employment	1
and	1
society	1
a	1
military	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
i	1
was	1
intended	1
for	1
but	1
circumstances	1
have	1
now	1
made	1
it	1
eligible	1
the	1
church	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
profession	1
i	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
valuable	1
living	1
had	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
gentleman	1
we	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
just	1
now	1
indeed	1
yes	1
the	1
late	1
mr	1
darcy	1
bequeathed	1
me	1
the	1
next	1
presentation	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
living	1
in	1
his	1
gift	1
he	1
was	1
my	1
godfather	1
and	1
excessively	1
attached	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
cannot	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
his	1
kindness	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
me	1
amply	1
and	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
living	1
fell	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
elsewhere	1
good	1
heavens	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
that	1
be	1
how	1
could	1
his	1
will	1
be	1
disregarded	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
seek	1
legal	1
redress	1
there	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
an	1
informality	1
in	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
bequest	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
no	1
hope	1
from	1
law	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
honour	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
doubted	1
the	1
intention	1
but	1
mr	1
darcy	1
chose	1
to	1
doubt	1
it	1
or	1
to	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
merely	1
conditional	1
recommendation	1
and	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
forfeited	1
all	1
claim	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
extravagance	1
imprudence	1
in	1
short	1
anything	1
or	1
nothing	1
certain	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
became	1
vacant	1
two	1
years	1
ago	1
exactly	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
age	1
to	1
hold	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
another	1
man	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
certain	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
i	1
cannot	1
accuse	1
myself	1
of	1
having	1
really	1
done	1
anything	1
to	1
deserve	1
to	1
lose	1
it	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
warm	1
unguarded	1
temper	1
and	1
i	1
may	1
have	1
spoken	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
too	1
freely	1
i	1
can	1
recall	1
nothing	1
worse	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
very	1
different	1
sort	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
hates	1
me	1
this	1
is	1
quite	1
shocking	1
he	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
publicly	1
disgraced	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
by	1
me	1
till	1
i	1
can	1
forget	1
his	1
father	1
i	1
can	1
never	1
defy	1
or	1
expose	1
him	1
elizabeth	1
honoured	1
him	1
for	1
such	1
feelings	1
and	1
thought	1
him	1
handsomer	1
than	1
ever	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
them	1
but	1
what	1
said	1
she	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
can	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
motive	1
what	1
can	1
have	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
behave	1
so	1
cruelly	1
a	1
thorough	1
determined	1
dislike	1
of	1
me	1
a	1
dislike	1
which	1
i	1
cannot	1
but	1
attribute	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
to	1
jealousy	1
had	1
the	1
late	1
mr	1
darcy	1
liked	1
me	1
less	1
his	1
son	1
might	1
have	1
borne	1
with	1
me	1
better	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
uncommon	1
attachment	1
to	1
me	1
irritated	1
him	1
i	1
believe	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
temper	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
competition	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
stood	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
preference	1
which	1
was	1
often	1
given	1
me	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
mr	1
darcy	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
this	1
though	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
liked	1
him	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
so	1
very	1
ill	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
had	1
supposed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
despising	1
his	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
in	1
general	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
suspect	1
him	1
of	1
descending	1
to	1
such	1
malicious	1
revenge	1
such	1
injustice	1
such	1
inhumanity	1
as	1
this	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
reflection	1
however	1
she	1
continued	1
i	1
do	1
remember	1
his	1
boasting	1
one	1
day	1
at	1
netherfield	1
of	1
the	1
implacability	1
of	1
his	1
resentments	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
an	1
unforgiving	1
temper	1
his	1
disposition	1
must	1
be	1
dreadful	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
trust	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
replied	1
wickham	1
i	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
just	1
to	1
him	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
again	1
deep	1
in	1
thought	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
exclaimed	1
to	1
treat	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
the	1
godson	1
the	1
friend	1
the	1
favourite	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
added	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
too	1
like	1
you	1
whose	1
very	1
countenance	1
may	1
vouch	1
for	1
your	1
being	1
amiable	1
but	1
she	1
contented	1
herself	1
with	1
and	1
one	1
too	1
who	1
had	1
probably	1
been	1
his	1
companion	1
from	1
childhood	1
connected	1
together	1
as	1
i	1
think	1
you	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
closest	1
manner	1
we	1
were	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
parish	1
within	1
the	1
same	1
park	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
youth	1
was	1
passed	1
together	1
inmates	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
sharing	1
the	1
same	1
amusements	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
parental	1
care	1
my	1
father	1
began	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
profession	1
which	1
your	1
uncle	1
mr	1
phillips	1
appears	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
credit	1
to	1
but	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
everything	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
the	1
late	1
mr	1
darcy	1
and	1
devoted	1
all	1
his	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
pemberley	1
property	1
he	1
was	1
most	1
highly	1
esteemed	1
by	1
mr	1
darcy	1
a	1
most	1
intimate	1
confidential	1
friend	1
mr	1
darcy	1
often	1
acknowledged	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
greatest	1
obligations	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
active	1
superintendence	1
and	1
when	1
immediately	1
before	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
death	1
mr	1
darcy	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
voluntary	1
promise	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
debt	1
of	1
gratitude	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
of	1
his	1
affection	1
to	1
myself	1
how	1
strange	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
how	1
abominable	1
i	1
wonder	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
pride	1
of	1
this	1
mr	1
darcy	1
has	1
not	1
made	1
him	1
just	1
to	1
you	1
if	1
from	1
no	1
better	1
motive	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
proud	1
to	1
be	1
dishonest	1
for	1
dishonesty	1
i	1
must	1
call	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
wonderful	1
replied	1
wickham	1
for	1
almost	1
all	1
his	1
actions	1
may	1
be	1
traced	1
to	1
pride	1
and	1
pride	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
his	1
best	1
friend	1
it	1
has	1
connected	1
him	1
nearer	1
with	1
virtue	1
than	1
with	1
any	1
other	1
feeling	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
consistent	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
me	1
there	1
were	1
stronger	1
impulses	1
even	1
than	1
pride	1
can	1
such	1
abominable	1
pride	1
as	1
his	1
have	1
ever	1
done	1
him	1
good	1
yes	1
it	1
has	1
often	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
liberal	1
and	1
generous	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
money	1
freely	1
to	1
display	1
hospitality	1
to	1
assist	1
his	1
tenants	1
and	1
relieve	1
the	1
poor	1
family	1
pride	1
and	1
filial	1
pride	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
what	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
not	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
disgrace	1
his	1
family	1
to	1
degenerate	1
from	1
the	1
popular	1
qualities	1
or	1
lose	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
pemberley	1
house	1
is	1
a	1
powerful	1
motive	1
he	1
has	1
also	1
brotherly	1
pride	1
which	1
with	1
some	1
brotherly	1
affection	1
makes	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
and	1
careful	1
guardian	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
him	1
generally	1
cried	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
attentive	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
brothers	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
is	1
miss	1
darcy	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
call	1
her	1
amiable	1
it	1
gives	1
me	1
pain	1
to	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
darcy	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
like	1
her	1
brother	1
very	1
very	1
proud	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
she	1
was	1
affectionate	1
and	1
pleasing	1
and	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
devoted	1
hours	1
and	1
hours	1
to	1
her	1
amusement	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
handsome	1
girl	1
about	1
fifteen	1
or	1
sixteen	1
and	1
i	1
understand	1
highly	1
accomplished	1
since	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
death	1
her	1
home	1
has	1
been	1
london	1
where	1
a	1
lady	1
lives	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
superintends	1
her	1
education	1
after	1
many	1
pauses	1
and	1
many	1
trials	1
of	1
other	1
subjects	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
reverting	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
saying	1
i	1
am	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
intimacy	1
with	1
mr	1
bingley	1
how	1
can	1
mr	1
bingley	1
who	1
seems	1
good	1
humour	1
itself	1
and	1
is	1
i	1
really	1
believe	1
truly	1
amiable	1
be	1
in	1
friendship	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
how	1
can	1
they	1
suit	1
each	1
other	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
mr	1
bingley	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
sweet	1
tempered	1
amiable	1
charming	1
man	1
he	1
cannot	1
know	1
what	1
mr	1
darcy	1
is	1
probably	1
not	1
but	1
mr	1
darcy	1
can	1
please	1
where	1
he	1
chooses	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
abilities	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
conversible	1
companion	1
if	1
he	1
thinks	1
it	1
worth	1
his	1
while	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
at	1
all	1
his	1
equals	1
in	1
consequence	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
man	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
less	1
prosperous	1
his	1
pride	1
never	1
deserts	1
him	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
rich	1
he	1
is	1
liberal	1
minded	1
just	1
sincere	1
rational	1
honourable	1
and	1
perhaps	1
agreeable	1
allowing	1
something	1
for	1
fortune	1
and	1
figure	1
the	1
whist	1
party	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
breaking	1
up	1
the	1
players	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
and	1
mr	1
collins	1
took	1
his	1
station	1
between	1
his	1
cousin	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
the	1
usual	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
success	1
were	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
latter	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
very	1
great	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
every	1
point	1
but	1
when	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
began	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
concern	1
thereupon	1
he	1
assured	1
her	1
with	1
much	1
earnest	1
gravity	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
importance	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
the	1
money	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
trifle	1
and	1
begged	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
herself	1
uneasy	1
i	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
madam	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
when	1
persons	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
card	1
table	1
they	1
must	1
take	1
their	1
chances	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
happily	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
such	1
circumstances	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
five	1
shillings	1
any	1
object	1
there	1
are	1
undoubtedly	1
many	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
but	1
thanks	1
to	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
i	1
am	1
removed	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
regarding	1
little	1
matters	1
mr	1
wickham	1
s	1
attention	1
was	1
caught	1
and	1
after	1
observing	1
mr	1
collins	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
he	1
asked	1
elizabeth	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
whether	1
her	1
relation	1
was	1
very	1
intimately	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
de	1
bourgh	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
she	1
replied	1
has	1
very	1
lately	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
living	1
i	1
hardly	1
know	1
how	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
first	1
introduced	1
to	1
her	1
notice	1
but	1
he	1
certainly	1
has	1
not	1
known	1
her	1
long	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
and	1
lady	1
anne	1
darcy	1
were	1
sisters	1
consequently	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
aunt	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
mr	1
darcy	1
no	1
indeed	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
i	1
knew	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
s	1
connections	1
i	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
her	1
daughter	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
fortune	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
believed	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
cousin	1
will	1
unite	1
the	1
two	1
estates	1
this	1
information	1
made	1
elizabeth	1
smile	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
poor	1
miss	1
bingley	1
vain	1
indeed	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
her	1
attentions	1
vain	1
and	1
useless	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
her	1
praise	1
of	1
himself	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
already	1
self	1
destined	1
for	1
another	1
mr	1
collins	1
said	1
she	1
speaks	1
highly	1
both	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
but	1
from	1
some	1
particulars	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
related	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship	1
i	1
suspect	1
his	1
gratitude	1
misleads	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
his	1
patroness	1
she	1
is	1
an	1
arrogant	1
conceited	1
woman	1
i	1
believe	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
both	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
degree	1
replied	1
wickham	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
but	1
i	1
very	1
well	1
remember	1
that	1
i	1
never	1
liked	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
manners	1
were	1
dictatorial	1
and	1
insolent	1
she	1
has	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
remarkably	1
sensible	1
and	1
clever	1
but	1
i	1
rather	1
believe	1
she	1
derives	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
abilities	1
from	1
her	1
rank	1
and	1
fortune	1
part	1
from	1
her	1
authoritative	1
manner	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
from	1
the	1
pride	1
for	1
her	1
nephew	1
who	1
chooses	1
that	1
everyone	1
connected	1
with	1
him	1
should	1
have	1
an	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
elizabeth	1
allowed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
very	1
rational	1
account	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
talking	1
together	1
with	1
mutual	1
satisfaction	1
till	1
supper	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
cards	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
mr	1
wickham	1
s	1
attentions	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
s	1
supper	1
party	1
but	1
his	1
manners	1
recommended	1
him	1
to	1
everybody	1
whatever	1
he	1
said	1
was	1

of	1

of	1
nothing	1

of	1
mr	1
wickham	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
way	1

there	1
was	1
not	1

to	1
mention	1

they	1

neither	1

the	1

his	1

related	1
to	1
jane	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
mr	1
wickham	1
and	1
herself	1
jane	1
listened	1
with	1
astonishment	1
and	1
concern	1
she	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
mr	1
darcy	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
unworthy	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
regard	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
nature	1
to	1
question	1
the	1
veracity	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
such	1
amiable	1
appearance	1
as	1
wickham	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
endured	1
such	1
unkindness	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
interest	1
all	1
her	1
tender	1
feelings	1
and	1
nothing	1
remained	1
therefore	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
them	1
both	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
each	1
and	1
throw	1
into	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
accident	1
or	1
mistake	1
whatever	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise	1
explained	1
they	1
have	1
both	1
said	1
she	1
been	1
deceived	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
form	1
no	1
idea	1
interested	1
people	1
have	1
perhaps	1
misrepresented	1
each	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
short	1
impossible	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
conjecture	1
the	1
causes	1
or	1
circumstances	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
alienated	1
them	1
without	1
actual	1
blame	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
very	1
true	1
indeed	1
and	1
now	1
my	1
dear	1
jane	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
to	1
say	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
interested	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
probably	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
do	1
clear	1
them	1
too	1
or	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
somebody	1
laugh	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
choose	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
laugh	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
opinion	1
my	1
dearest	1
lizzy	1
do	1
but	1
consider	1
in	1
what	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
light	1
it	1
places	1
mr	1
darcy	1
to	1
be	1
treating	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
favourite	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
one	1
whom	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
no	1
man	1
of	1
common	1
humanity	1
no	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
any	1
value	1
for	1
his	1
character	1
could	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
it	1
can	1
his	1
most	1
intimate	1
friends	1
be	1
so	1
excessively	1
deceived	1
in	1
him	1
oh	1
no	1
i	1
can	1
much	1
more	1
easily	1
believe	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
being	1
imposed	1
on	1
than	1
that	1
mr	1
wickham	1
should	1
invent	1
such	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
last	1
night	1
names	1
facts	1
everything	1
mentioned	1
without	1
ceremony	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
so	1
let	1
mr	1
darcy	1
contradict	1
it	1
besides	1
there	1
was	1
truth	1
in	1
his	1
looks	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
indeed	1
it	1
is	1
distressing	1
one	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
i	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
one	1
knows	1
exactly	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
but	1
jane	1
could	1
think	1
with	1
certainty	1
on	1
only	1
one	1
point	1
that	1
mr	1
bingley	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
imposed	1
on	1
would	1
have	1
much	1
to	1
suffer	1
when	1
the	1
affair	1
became	1
public	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
ladies	1
were	1
summoned	1
from	1
the	1
shrubbery	1
where	1
this	1
conversation	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
persons	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
speaking	1
mr	1
bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sisters	1
came	1
to	1
give	1
their	1
personal	1
invitation	1
for	1
the	1
long	1
expected	1
ball	1
at	1
netherfield	1
which	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
following	1
tuesday	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
dear	1
friend	1
again	1
called	1
it	1
an	1
age	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
met	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
asked	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
with	1
herself	1
since	1
their	1
separation	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
they	1
paid	1
little	1
attention	1
avoiding	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
saying	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
they	1
were	1
soon	1
gone	1
again	1
rising	1
from	1
their	1
seats	1
with	1
an	1
activity	1
which	1
took	1
their	1
brother	1
by	1
surprise	1
and	1
hurrying	1
off	1
as	1
if	1
eager	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
s	1
civilities	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
the	1
netherfield	1
ball	1
was	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
to	1
every	1
female	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
chose	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
given	1
in	1
compliment	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
and	1
was	1
particularly	1
flattered	1
by	1
receiving	1
the	1
invitation	1
from	1
mr	1
bingley	1
himself	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
ceremonious	1
card	1
jane	1
pictured	1
to	1
herself	1
a	1
happy	1
evening	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
her	1
two	1
friends	1
and	1
the	1
attentions	1
of	1
their	1
brother	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
thought	1
with	1
pleasure	1
of	1
dancing	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
with	1
mr	1
wickham	1
and	1
of	1
seeing	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
everything	1
in	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
look	1
and	1
behaviour	1
the	1
happiness	1
anticipated	1
by	1
catherine	1
and	1
lydia	1
depended	1
less	1
on	1
any	1
single	1
event	1
or	1
any	1
particular	1
person	1
for	1
though	1
they	1
each	1
like	1
elizabeth	1
meant	1
to	1
dance	1
half	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
mr	1
wickham	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
the	1
only	1
partner	1
who	1
could	1
satisfy	1
them	1
and	1
a	1
ball	1
was	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
a	1
ball	1
and	1
even	1
mary	1
could	1
assure	1
her	1
family	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
disinclination	1
for	1
it	1
while	1
i	1
can	1
have	1
my	1
mornings	1
to	1
myself	1
said	1
she	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
join	1
occasionally	1
in	1
evening	1
engagements	1
society	1
has	1
claims	1
on	1
us	1
all	1
and	1
i	1
profess	1
myself	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
consider	1
intervals	1
of	1
recreation	1
and	1
amusement	1
as	1
desirable	1
for	1
everybody	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
spirits	1
were	1
so	1
high	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
often	1
speak	1
unnecessarily	1
to	1
mr	1
collins	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
asking	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
accept	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
invitation	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
think	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
s	1
amusement	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
rather	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
entertained	1
no	1
scruple	1
whatever	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
dreading	1
a	1
rebuke	1
either	1
from	1
the	1
archbishop	1
or	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
by	1
venturing	1
to	1
dance	1
i	1
am	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
opinion	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
a	1
ball	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
given	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
character	1
to	1
respectable	1
people	1
can	1
have	1
any	1
evil	1
tendency	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
objecting	1
to	1
dancing	1
myself	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
honoured	1
with	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
fair	1
cousins	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
i	1
take	1
this	1
opportunity	1
of	1
soliciting	1
yours	1
miss	1
elizabeth	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
first	1
dances	1
especially	1
a	1
preference	1
which	1
i	1
trust	1
my	1
cousin	1
jane	1
will	1
attribute	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
cause	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
any	1
disrespect	1
for	1
her	1
elizabeth	1
felt	1
herself	1
completely	1
taken	1
in	1
she	1
had	1
fully	1
proposed	1
being	1
engaged	1
by	1
mr	1
wickham	1
for	1
those	1
very	1
dances	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
mr	1
collins	1
instead	1
her	1
liveliness	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
worse	1
timed	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
however	1
mr	1
wickham	1
s	1
happiness	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
were	1
perforce	1
delayed	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
and	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
proposal	1
accepted	1
with	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
grace	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
better	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
gallantry	1
from	1
the	1
idea	1
it	1
suggested	1
of	1
something	1
more	1
it	1
now	1
first	1
struck	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
selected	1
from	1
among	1
her	1
sisters	1
as	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
mistress	1
of	1
hunsford	1
parsonage	1
and	1
of	1
assisting	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
quadrille	1
table	1
at	1
rosings	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
more	1
eligible	1
visitors	1
the	1
idea	1
soon	1
reached	1
to	1
conviction	1
as	1
she	1
observed	1
his	1
increasing	1
civilities	1
toward	1
herself	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
frequent	1
attempt	1
at	1
a	1
compliment	1
on	1
her	1
wit	1
and	1
vivacity	1
and	1
though	1
more	1
astonished	1
than	1
gratified	1
herself	1
by	1
this	1
effect	1
of	1
her	1
charms	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
before	1
her	1
mother	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
their	1
marriage	1
was	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
to	1
her	1
elizabeth	1
however	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
hint	1
being	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
a	1
serious	1
dispute	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
any	1
reply	1
mr	1
collins	1
might	1
never	1
make	1
the	1
offer	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
quarrel	1
about	1
him	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
netherfield	1
ball	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
and	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
miss	1
bennets	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
pitiable	1
state	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
invitation	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ball	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
rain	1
as	1
prevented	1
their	1
walking	1
to	1
meryton	1
once	1
no	1
aunt	1
no	1
officers	1
no	1
news	1
could	1
be	1
sought	1
after	1
the	1
very	1
shoe	1
roses	1
for	1
netherfield	1
were	1
got	1
by	1
proxy	1
even	1
elizabeth	1
might	1
have	1
found	1
some	1
trial	1
of	1
her	1
patience	1
in	1
weather	1
which	1
totally	1
suspended	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
mr	1
wickham	1
and	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
dance	1
on	1
tuesday	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
friday	1

and	1

chapter	1
18	1
till	1
elizabeth	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
at	1
netherfield	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
mr	1
wickham	1
among	1
the	1
cluster	1
of	1
red	1
coats	1
there	1
assembled	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
present	1
had	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
meeting	1
him	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
checked	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
recollections	1
that	1
might	1
not	1
unreasonably	1
have	1
alarmed	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
dressed	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
care	1
and	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spirits	1
for	1
the	1
conquest	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
unsubdued	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
trusting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
might	1
be	1
won	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
but	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
arose	1
the	1
dreadful	1
suspicion	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
purposely	1
omitted	1
for	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
bingleys	1
invitation	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
the	1
case	1
the	1
absolute	1
fact	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
was	1
pronounced	1
by	1
his	1
friend	1
denny	1
to	1
whom	1
lydia	1
eagerly	1
applied	1
and	1
who	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
wickham	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
town	1
on	1
business	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
returned	1
adding	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
smile	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
his	1
business	1
would	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
away	1
just	1
now	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
wanted	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
certain	1
gentleman	1
here	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
intelligence	1
though	1
unheard	1
by	1
lydia	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
darcy	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
answerable	1
for	1
wickham	1
s	1
absence	1
than	1
if	1
her	1
first	1
surmise	1
had	1
been	1
just	1
every	1
feeling	1
of	1
displeasure	1
against	1
the	1
former	1
was	1
so	1
sharpened	1
by	1
immediate	1
disappointment	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
reply	1
with	1
tolerable	1
civility	1
to	1
the	1
polite	1
inquiries	1
which	1
he	1
directly	1
afterwards	1
approached	1
to	1
make	1
attendance	1
forbearance	1
patience	1
with	1
darcy	1
was	1
injury	1
to	1
wickham	1
she	1
was	1
resolved	1
against	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
ill	1
humour	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
wholly	1
surmount	1
even	1
in	1
speaking	1
to	1
mr	1
bingley	1
whose	1
blind	1
partiality	1
provoked	1
her	1
but	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
not	1
formed	1
for	1
ill	1
humour	1
and	1
though	1
every	1
prospect	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
was	1
destroyed	1
for	1
the	1
evening	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
dwell	1
long	1
on	1
her	1
spirits	1
and	1
having	1
told	1
all	1
her	1
griefs	1
to	1
charlotte	1
lucas	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
voluntary	1
transition	1
to	1
the	1
oddities	1
of	1
her	1
cousin	1
and	1
to	1
point	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
particular	1
notice	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
dances	1
however	1
brought	1
a	1
return	1
of	1
distress	1
they	1
were	1
dances	1
of	1
mortification	1
mr	1
collins	1
awkward	1
and	1
solemn	1
apologising	1
instead	1
of	1
attending	1
and	1
often	1
moving	1
wrong	1
without	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
gave	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
misery	1
which	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
partner	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dances	1
can	1
give	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
her	1
release	1
from	1
him	1
was	1
ecstasy	1
she	1
danced	1
next	1
with	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
refreshment	1
of	1
talking	1
of	1
wickham	1
and	1
of	1
hearing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
universally	1
liked	1
when	1
those	1
dances	1
were	1
over	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
charlotte	1
lucas	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
suddenly	1
addressed	1
by	1
mr	1
darcy	1
who	1
took	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
surprise	1
in	1
his	1
application	1
for	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
she	1
accepted	1
him	1
he	1
walked	1
away	1
again	1
immediately	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
fret	1
over	1
her	1
own	1
want	1
of	1
presence	1
of	1
mind	1
charlotte	1
tried	1
to	1
console	1
her	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
him	1
very	1
agreeable	1
heaven	1
forbid	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
greatest	1
misfortune	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
man	1
agreeable	1
whom	1
one	1
is	1
determined	1
to	1
hate	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
me	1
such	1
an	1
evil	1
when	1
the	1
dancing	1
recommenced	1
however	1
and	1
darcy	1
approached	1
to	1
claim	1
her	1
hand	1
charlotte	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
cautioning	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
simpleton	1
and	1
allow	1
her	1
fancy	1
for	1
wickham	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
appear	1
unpleasant	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
ten	1
times	1
his	1
consequence	1
elizabeth	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
set	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
dignity	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
arrived	1
in	1
being	1
allowed	1
to	1
stand	1
opposite	1
to	1
mr	1
darcy	1
and	1
reading	1
in	1
her	1
neighbours	1
looks	1
their	1
equal	1
amazement	1
in	1
beholding	1
it	1
they	1
stood	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
speaking	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
their	1
silence	1
was	1
to	1
last	1
through	1
the	1
two	1
dances	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
it	1
till	1
suddenly	1
fancying	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
greater	1
punishment	1
to	1
her	1
partner	1
to	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
she	1
made	1
some	1
slight	1
observation	1
on	1
the	1
dance	1
he	1
replied	1
and	1
was	1
again	1
silent	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
some	1
minutes	1
she	1
addressed	1
him	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
with	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
turn	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
now	1
mr	1
darcy	1
i	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
dance	1
and	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
remark	1
on	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
or	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
couples	1
he	1
smiled	1
and	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
whatever	1
she	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
should	1
be	1
said	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
reply	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
perhaps	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
i	1
may	1
observe	1
that	1
private	1
balls	1
are	1
much	1
pleasanter	1
than	1
public	1
ones	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
silent	1
do	1
you	1
talk	1
by	1
rule	1
then	1
while	1
you	1
are	1
dancing	1
sometimes	1
one	1
must	1
speak	1
a	1
little	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
would	1
look	1
odd	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
silent	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
together	1
and	1
yet	1
for	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
some	1
conversation	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
arranged	1
as	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
saying	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
are	1
you	1
consulting	1
your	1
own	1
feelings	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
imagine	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
gratifying	1
mine	1
both	1
replied	1
elizabeth	1
archly	1
for	1
i	1
have	1
always	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
similarity	1
in	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
our	1
minds	1
we	1
are	1
each	1
of	1
an	1
unsocial	1
taciturn	1
disposition	1
unwilling	1
to	1
speak	1
unless	1
we	1
expect	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
amaze	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
and	1
be	1
handed	1
down	1
to	1
posterity	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
éclat	1
of	1
a	1
proverb	1
this	1
is	1
no	1
very	1
striking	1
resemblance	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
character	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
said	1
he	1
how	1
near	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
mine	1
i	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
faithful	1
portrait	1
undoubtedly	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
decide	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
performance	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
silent	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
the	1
dance	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
did	1
not	1
very	1
often	1
walk	1
to	1
meryton	1
she	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
temptation	1
added	1
when	1
you	1
met	1
us	1
there	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
forming	1
a	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
the	1
effect	1
was	1
immediate	1
a	1
deeper	1
shade	1
of	1
hauteur	1
overspread	1
his	1
features	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
though	1
blaming	1
herself	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
weakness	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
at	1
length	1
darcy	1
spoke	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
constrained	1
manner	1
said	1
mr	1
wickham	1
is	1
blessed	1
with	1
such	1
happy	1
manners	1
as	1
may	1
ensure	1
his	1
making	1
friends	1
whether	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
equally	1
capable	1
of	1
retaining	1
them	1
is	1
less	1
certain	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
unlucky	1
as	1
to	1
lose	1
your	1
friendship	1
replied	1
elizabeth	1
with	1
emphasis	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
darcy	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
of	1
changing	1
the	1
subject	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
sir	1
william	1
lucas	1
appeared	1
close	1
to	1
them	1
meaning	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
set	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
but	1
on	1
perceiving	1
mr	1
darcy	1
he	1
stopped	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
of	1
superior	1
courtesy	1
to	1
compliment	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
dancing	1
and	1
his	1
partner	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
highly	1
gratified	1
indeed	1
my	1
dear	1
sir	1
such	1
very	1
superior	1
dancing	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
seen	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
you	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
circles	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
however	1
that	1
your	1
fair	1
partner	1
does	1
not	1
disgrace	1
you	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
hope	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
pleasure	1
often	1
repeated	1
especially	1
when	1
a	1
certain	1
desirable	1
event	1
my	1
dear	1
eliza	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
bingley	1
shall	1
take	1
place	1
what	1
congratulations	1
will	1
then	1
flow	1
in	1
i	1
appeal	1
to	1
mr	1
darcy	1
but	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
interrupt	1
you	1
sir	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
thank	1
me	1
for	1
detaining	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
bewitching	1
converse	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
lady	1
whose	1
bright	1
eyes	1
are	1
also	1
upbraiding	1
me	1
the	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
address	1
was	1
scarcely	1
heard	1
by	1
darcy	1
but	1
sir	1
william	1
s	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
seemed	1
to	1
strike	1
him	1
forcibly	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
directed	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
expression	1
towards	1
bingley	1
and	1
jane	1
who	1
were	1
dancing	1
together	1
recovering	1
himself	1
however	1
shortly	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
partner	1
and	1
said	1
sir	1
william	1
s	1
interruption	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
forget	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
we	1
were	1
speaking	1
at	1
all	1
sir	1
william	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
interrupted	1
two	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
who	1
had	1
less	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
themselves	1
we	1
have	1
tried	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
subjects	1
already	1
without	1
success	1
and	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
next	1
i	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
what	1
think	1
you	1
of	1
books	1
said	1
he	1
smiling	1
books	1
oh	1
no	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
never	1
read	1
the	1
same	1
or	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
but	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
there	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
subject	1
we	1
may	1
compare	1
our	1
different	1
opinions	1
no	1
i	1
cannot	1
talk	1
of	1
books	1
in	1
a	1
ball	1
room	1
my	1
head	1
is	1
always	1
full	1
of	1
something	1
else	1
the	1
present	1
always	1
occupies	1
you	1
in	1
such	1
scenes	1
does	1
it	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
doubt	1
yes	1
always	1
she	1
replied	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
for	1
her	1
thoughts	1
had	1
wandered	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
subject	1
as	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
appeared	1
by	1
her	1
suddenly	1
exclaiming	1
i	1
remember	1
hearing	1
you	1
once	1
say	1
mr	1
darcy	1
that	1
you	1
hardly	1
ever	1
forgave	1
that	1
your	1
resentment	1
once	1
created	1
was	1
unappeasable	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
cautious	1
i	1
suppose	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
being	1
created	1
	1
i	1
am	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
voice	1
and	1
never	1
allow	1
yourself	1
to	1
be	1
blinded	1
by	1
prejudice	1
i	1
hope	1
not	1
it	1
is	1
particularly	1
incumbent	1
on	1
those	1
who	1
never	1
change	1
their	1
opinion	1
to	1
be	1
secure	1
of	1
judging	1
properly	1
at	1
first	1
may	1
i	1
ask	1
to	1
what	1
these	1
questions	1
tend	1
merely	1
to	1
the	1
illustration	1
of	1
your	1
character	1
said	1
she	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
shake	1
off	1
her	1
gravity	1
i	1
am	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
success	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
get	1
on	1
at	1
all	1
i	1
hear	1
such	1
different	1
accounts	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
puzzle	1
me	1
exceedingly	1
i	1
can	1
readily	1
believe	1
answered	1
he	1
gravely	1
that	1
reports	1
may	1
vary	1
greatly	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
wish	1
miss	1
bennet	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
sketch	1
my	1
character	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
performance	1
would	1
reflect	1
no	1
credit	1
on	1
either	1
but	1
if	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
take	1
your	1
likeness	1
now	1
i	1
may	1
never	1
have	1
another	1
opportunity	1
i	1
would	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
suspend	1
any	1
pleasure	1
of	1
yours	1
he	1
coldly	1
replied	1
she	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
other	1
dance	1
and	1
parted	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
dissatisfied	1
though	1
not	1
to	1
an	1
equal	1
degree	1
for	1
in	1
darcy	1
s	1
breast	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tolerably	1
powerful	1
feeling	1
towards	1
her	1
which	1
soon	1
procured	1
her	1
pardon	1
and	1
directed	1
all	1
his	1
anger	1
against	1
another	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
separated	1
when	1
miss	1
bingley	1
came	1
towards	1
her	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
civil	1
disdain	1
accosted	1
her	1
so	1
miss	1
eliza	1
i	1
hear	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
delighted	1
with	1
george	1
wickham	1
your	1
sister	1
has	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
me	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
asking	1
me	1
a	1
thousand	1
questions	1
and	1
i	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
quite	1
forgot	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
among	1
his	1
other	1
communication	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
old	1
wickham	1
the	1
late	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
steward	1
let	1
me	1
recommend	1
you	1
however	1
as	1
a	1
friend	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
implicit	1
confidence	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
assertions	1
for	1
as	1
to	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
using	1
him	1
ill	1
it	1
is	1
perfectly	1
false	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
remarkably	1
kind	1
to	1
him	1
though	1
george	1
wickham	1
has	1
treated	1
mr	1
darcy	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
infamous	1
manner	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
particulars	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
mr	1
darcy	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
blame	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
george	1
wickham	1
mentioned	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
my	1
brother	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
avoid	1
including	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
invitation	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
he	1
was	1
excessively	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
himself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
his	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
all	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
insolent	1
thing	1
indeed	1
and	1
i	1
wonder	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
presume	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
i	1
pity	1
you	1
miss	1
eliza	1
for	1
this	1
discovery	1
of	1
your	1
favourite	1
s	1
guilt	1
but	1
really	1
considering	1
his	1
descent	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
expect	1
much	1
better	1
his	1
guilt	1
and	1
his	1
descent	1
appear	1
by	1
your	1
account	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
angrily	1
for	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
accuse	1
him	1
of	1
nothing	1
worse	1
than	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
steward	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
he	1
informed	1
me	1
himself	1
i	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
replied	1
miss	1
bingley	1
turning	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
sneer	1
excuse	1
my	1
interference	1
it	1
was	1
kindly	1
meant	1
insolent	1
girl	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
to	1
herself	1
you	1
are	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
influence	1
me	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
paltry	1
attack	1
as	1
this	1
i	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
your	1
own	1
wilful	1
ignorance	1
and	1
the	1
malice	1
of	1
mr	1
darcy	1
she	1
then	1
sought	1
her	1
eldest	1
sister	1
who	1
had	1
undertaken	1
to	1
make	1
inquiries	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
subject	1
of	1
bingley	1
jane	1
met	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
such	1
sweet	1
complacency	1
a	1
glow	1
of	1
such	1
happy	1
expression	1
as	1
sufficiently	1
marked	1
how	1
well	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
elizabeth	1
instantly	1
read	1
her	1
feelings	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
solicitude	1
for	1
wickham	1
resentment	1
against	1
his	1
enemies	1
and	1
everything	1
else	1
gave	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
jane	1
s	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
fairest	1
way	1
for	1
happiness	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
a	1
countenance	1
no	1
less	1
smiling	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
learnt	1
about	1
mr	1
wickham	1
but	1
perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
pleasantly	1
engaged	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
any	1
third	1
person	1
in	1
which	1
case	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
my	1
pardon	1
no	1
replied	1
jane	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
forgotten	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
satisfactory	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
mr	1
bingley	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
history	1
and	1
is	1
quite	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
have	1
principally	1
offended	1
mr	1
darcy	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
vouch	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
conduct	1
the	1
probity	1
and	1
honour	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
is	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
that	1
mr	1
wickham	1
has	1
deserved	1
much	1
less	1
attention	1
from	1
mr	1
darcy	1
than	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
by	1
his	1
account	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
mr	1
wickham	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
a	1
respectable	1
young	1
man	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
imprudent	1
and	1
has	1
deserved	1
to	1
lose	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
regard	1
mr	1
bingley	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
mr	1
wickham	1
himself	1
no	1
he	1
never	1
saw	1
him	1
till	1
the	1
other	1
morning	1
at	1
meryton	1
this	1
account	1
then	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
from	1
mr	1
darcy	1
i	1
am	1
satisfied	1
but	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
exactly	1
recollect	1
the	1
circumstances	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
heard	1
them	1
from	1
mr	1
darcy	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
but	1
he	1
believes	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
him	1
conditionally	1
only	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
sincerity	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
warmly	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
my	1
not	1
being	1
convinced	1
by	1
assurances	1
only	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
defense	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
able	1
one	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
but	1
since	1
he	1
is	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
several	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
and	1
has	1
learnt	1
the	1
rest	1
from	1
that	1
friend	1
himself	1
i	1
shall	1
venture	1
to	1
still	1
think	1
of	1
both	1
gentlemen	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
before	1
she	1
then	1
changed	1
the	1
discourse	1
to	1
one	1
more	1
gratifying	1
to	1
each	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
difference	1
of	1
sentiment	1
elizabeth	1
listened	1
with	1
delight	1
to	1
the	1
happy	1
though	1
modest	1
hopes	1
which	1
jane	1
entertained	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
regard	1
and	1
said	1
all	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
heighten	1
her	1
confidence	1
in	1
it	1
on	1
their	1
being	1
joined	1
by	1
mr	1
bingley	1
himself	1
elizabeth	1
withdrew	1
to	1
miss	1
lucas	1
to	1
whose	1
inquiry	1
after	1
the	1
pleasantness	1
of	1
her	1
last	1
partner	1
she	1
had	1
scarcely	1
replied	1
before	1
mr	1
collins	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
exultation	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
most	1
important	1
discovery	1
i	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
said	1
he	1
by	1
a	1
singular	1
accident	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
near	1
relation	1
of	1
my	1
patroness	1
i	1
happened	1
to	1
overhear	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself	1
mentioning	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
who	1
does	1
the	1
honours	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
cousin	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
lady	1
catherine	1
how	1
wonderfully	1
these	1
sort	1
of	1
things	1
occur	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
meeting	1
with	1
perhaps	1
a	1
nephew	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
in	1
this	1
assembly	1
i	1
am	1
most	1
thankful	1
that	1
the	1
discovery	1
is	1
made	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
pay	1
my	1
respects	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
trust	1
he	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
it	1
before	1
my	1
total	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
connection	1
must	1
plead	1
my	1
apology	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
introduce	1
yourself	1
to	1
mr	1
darcy	1
indeed	1
i	1
am	1
i	1
shall	1
entreat	1
his	1
pardon	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
it	1
earlier	1
i	1
believe	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
lady	1
catherine	1
s	1
nephew	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship	1
was	1
quite	1
well	1
yesterday	1
se	1
nnight	1
elizabeth	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
dissuade	1
him	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
scheme	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
mr	1
darcy	1
would	1
consider	1
his	1
addressing	1
him	1
without	1
introduction	1
as	1
an	1
impertinent	1
freedom	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
compliment	1
to	1
his	1
aunt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
necessary	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
any	1
notice	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
it	1
must	1
belong	1
to	1
mr	1
darcy	1
the	1
superior	1
in	1
consequence	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
mr	1
collins	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
determined	1
air	1
of	1
following	1
his	1
own	1
inclination	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
replied	1
thus	1
my	1
dear	1
miss	1
elizabeth	1
i	1
have	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
your	1
excellent	1
judgement	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
within	1
the	1
scope	1
of	1
your	1
understanding	1
but	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
wide	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
established	1
forms	1
of	1
ceremony	1
amongst	1
the	1
laity	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
regulate	1
the	1
clergy	1
for	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
i	1
consider	1
the	1
clerical	1
office	1
as	1
equal	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
dignity	1
with	1
the	1
highest	1
rank	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
provided	1
that	1
a	1
proper	1
humility	1
of	1
behaviour	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
maintained	1
you	1
must	1
therefore	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
my	1
conscience	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
which	1
leads	1
me	1
to	1
perform	1
what	1
i	1
look	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
duty	1
pardon	1
me	1
for	1
neglecting	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
your	1
advice	1
which	1
on	1
every	1
other	1
subject	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
constant	1
guide	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
before	1
us	1
i	1
consider	1
myself	1
more	1
fitted	1
by	1
education	1
and	1
habitual	1
study	1
to	1
decide	1
on	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
than	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
like	1
yourself	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
bow	1
he	1
left	1
her	1
to	1
attack	1
mr	1
darcy	1
whose	1
reception	1
of	1
his	1
advances	1
she	1
eagerly	1
watched	1
and	1
whose	1
astonishment	1
at	1
being	1
so	1
addressed	1
was	1
very	1
evident	1
her	1
cousin	1
prefaced	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
a	1
solemn	1
bow	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
hearing	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
words	1
apology	1
hunsford	1
and	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
it	1
vexed	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
expose	1
himself	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
mr	1
darcy	1
was	1
eyeing	1
him	1
with	1
unrestrained	1
wonder	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
mr	1
collins	1
allowed	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
speak	1
replied	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
distant	1
civility	1
mr	1
collins	1
however	1
was	1
not	1
discouraged	1
from	1
speaking	1
again	1
and	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
contempt	1
seemed	1
abundantly	1
increasing	1
with	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
second	1
speech	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
only	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
and	1
moved	1
another	1
way	1
mr	1
collins	1
then	1
returned	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
my	1
reception	1
mr	1
darcy	1
seemed	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
attention	1
he	1
answered	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
civility	1
and	1
even	1
paid	1
me	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
convinced	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
s	1
discernment	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
bestow	1
a	1
favour	1
unworthily	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
thought	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
i	1
am	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
interest	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
to	1
pursue	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
attention	1
almost	1
entirely	1
on	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
mr	1
bingley	1
and	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
agreeable	1
reflections	1
which	1
her	1
observations	1
gave	1
birth	1
to	1
made	1
her	1
perhaps	1
almost	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
jane	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
idea	1
settled	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
house	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
felicity	1
which	1
a	1
marriage	1
of	1
true	1
affection	1
could	1
bestow	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
capable	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances	1
of	1
endeavouring	1
even	1
to	1
like	1
bingley	1
s	1
two	1
sisters	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
thoughts	1
she	1
plainly	1
saw	1
were	1
bent	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
and	1
she	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
venture	1
near	1
her	1
lest	1
she	1
might	1
hear	1
too	1
much	1
when	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
supper	1
therefore	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
a	1
most	1
unlucky	1
perverseness	1
which	1
placed	1
them	1
within	1
one	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
deeply	1
was	1
she	1
vexed	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
that	1
one	1
person	1
lady	1
lucas	1
freely	1
openly	1
and	1
of	1
nothing	1
else	1
but	1
her	1
expectation	1
that	1
jane	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
mr	1
bingley	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
animating	1
subject	1
and	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
seemed	1
incapable	1
of	1
fatigue	1
while	1
enumerating	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
match	1
his	1
being	1
such	1
a	1
charming	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
so	1
rich	1
and	1
living	1
but	1
three	1
miles	1
from	1
them	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
points	1
of	1
self	1
gratulation	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
fond	1
the	1
two	1
sisters	1
were	1
of	1
jane	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
desire	1
the	1
connection	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
it	1
was	1
moreover	1
such	1
a	1
promising	1
thing	1
for	1
her	1
younger	1
daughters	1
as	1
jane	1
s	1
marrying	1
so	1
greatly	1
must	1
throw	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
other	1
rich	1
men	1
and	1
lastly	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
pleasant	1
at	1
her	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
consign	1
her	1
single	1
daughters	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
their	1
sister	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
company	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
liked	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
circumstance	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
pleasure	1
because	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
etiquette	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
less	1
likely	1
than	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
to	1
find	1
comfort	1
in	1
staying	1
home	1
at	1
any	1
period	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
she	1
concluded	1
with	1
many	1
good	1
wishes	1
that	1
lady	1
lucas	1
might	1
soon	1
be	1
equally	1
fortunate	1
though	1
evidently	1
and	1
triumphantly	1
believing	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
vain	1
did	1
elizabeth	1
endeavour	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
words	1
or	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
describe	1
her	1
felicity	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
audible	1
whisper	1
for	1
to	1
her	1
inexpressible	1
vexation	1
she	1
could	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
overheard	1
by	1
mr	1
darcy	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite	1
to	1
them	1
her	1
mother	1
only	1
scolded	1
her	1
for	1
being	1
nonsensical	1
what	1
is	1
mr	1
darcy	1
to	1
me	1
pray	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
owe	1
him	1
no	1
such	1
particular	1
civility	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
for	1
heaven	1
s	1
sake	1
madam	1
speak	1
lower	1
what	1
advantage	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
offend	1
mr	1
darcy	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
recommend	1
yourself	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
nothing	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
however	1
had	1
any	1
influence	1
her	1
mother	1
would	1
talk	1
of	1
her	1
views	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
intelligible	1
tone	1
elizabeth	1
blushed	1
and	1
blushed	1
again	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
vexation	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
frequently	1
glancing	1
her	1
eye	1
at	1
mr	1
darcy	1
though	1
every	1
glance	1
convinced	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
dreaded	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
mother	1
she	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
invariably	1
fixed	1
by	1
her	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
changed	1
gradually	1
from	1
indignant	1
contempt	1
to	1
a	1
composed	1
and	1
steady	1
gravity	1
at	1
length	1
however	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
lady	1
lucas	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
yawning	1
at	1
the	1
repetition	1
of	1
delights	1
which	1
she	1
saw	1
no	1
likelihood	1
of	1
sharing	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
cold	1
ham	1
and	1
chicken	1
elizabeth	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
revive	1
but	1
not	1
long	1
was	1
the	1
interval	1
of	1
tranquillity	1
for	1
when	1
supper	1
was	1
over	1
singing	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
mortification	1
of	1
seeing	1
mary	1
after	1
very	1
little	1
entreaty	1
preparing	1
to	1
oblige	1
the	1
company	1
by	1
many	1
significant	1
looks	1
and	1
silent	1
entreaties	1
did	1
she	1
endeavour	1
to	1
prevent	1
such	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
complaisance	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
mary	1
would	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
exhibiting	1
was	1
delightful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
her	1
song	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
with	1
most	1
painful	1
sensations	1
and	1
she	1
watched	1
her	1
progress	1
through	1
the	1
several	1
stanzas	1
with	1
an	1
impatience	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
ill	1
rewarded	1
at	1
their	1
close	1
for	1
mary	1
on	1
receiving	1
amongst	1
the	1
thanks	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
hint	1
of	1
a	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
favour	1
them	1
again	1
after	1
the	1
pause	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
minute	1
began	1
another	1
mary	1
s	1
powers	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
fitted	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
display	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
weak	1
and	1
her	1
manner	1
affected	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
in	1
agonies	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
jane	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
she	1
bore	1
it	1
but	1
jane	1
was	1
very	1
composedly	1
talking	1
to	1
bingley	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
making	1
signs	1
of	1
derision	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
at	1
darcy	1
who	1
continued	1
however	1
imperturbably	1
grave	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
entreat	1
his	1
interference	1
lest	1
mary	1
should	1
be	1
singing	1
all	1
night	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
hint	1
and	1
when	1
mary	1
had	1
finished	1
her	1
second	1
song	1
said	1
aloud	1
that	1
will	1
do	1
extremely	1
well	1
child	1
you	1
have	1
delighted	1
us	1
long	1
enough	1
let	1
the	1
other	1
young	1
ladies	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
exhibit	1
mary	1
though	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
was	1
somewhat	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
speech	1
was	1
afraid	1
her	1
anxiety	1
had	1
done	1
no	1
good	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
were	1
now	1
applied	1
to	1
if	1
i	1
said	1
mr	1
collins	1
were	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
sing	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
great	1
pleasure	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
in	1
obliging	1
the	1
company	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
for	1
i	1
consider	1
music	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
innocent	1
diversion	1
and	1
perfectly	1
compatible	1
with	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
a	1
clergyman	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
however	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
devoting	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
our	1
time	1
to	1
music	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
certainly	1
other	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
attended	1
to	1
the	1
rector	1
of	1
a	1
parish	1
has	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
must	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
agreement	1
for	1
tithes	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
beneficial	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
offensive	1
to	1
his	1
patron	1
he	1
must	1
write	1
his	1
own	1
sermons	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
remains	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
his	1
parish	1
duties	1
and	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
improvement	1
of	1
his	1
dwelling	1
which	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
excused	1
from	1
making	1
as	1
comfortable	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
of	1
light	1
importance	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
attentive	1
and	1
conciliatory	1
manners	1
towards	1
everybody	1
especially	1
towards	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
owes	1
his	1
preferment	1
i	1
cannot	1
acquit	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
duty	1
nor	1
could	1
i	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
should	1
omit	1
an	1
occasion	1
of	1
testifying	1
his	1
respect	1
towards	1
anybody	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
mr	1
darcy	1
he	1
concluded	1
his	1
speech	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
so	1
loud	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
by	1
half	1
the	1
room	1
many	1
stared	1
many	1
smiled	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
looked	1
more	1
amused	1
than	1
mr	1
bennet	1
himself	1
while	1
his	1
wife	1
seriously	1
commended	1
mr	1
collins	1
for	1
having	1
spoken	1
so	1
sensibly	1
and	1
observed	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper	1
to	1
lady	1
lucas	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
remarkably	1
clever	1
good	1
kind	1
of	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
had	1
her	1
family	1
made	1
an	1
agreement	1
to	1
expose	1
themselves	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
during	1
the	1
evening	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
play	1
their	1
parts	1
with	1
more	1
spirit	1
or	1
finer	1
success	1
and	1
happy	1
did	1
she	1
think	1
it	1
for	1
bingley	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
exhibition	1
had	1
escaped	1
his	1
notice	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
distressed	1
by	1
the	1
folly	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
witnessed	1
that	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
and	1
mr	1
darcy	1
however	1
should	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
ridiculing	1
her	1
relations	1
was	1
bad	1
enough	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
determine	1
whether	1
the	1
silent	1
contempt	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
or	1
the	1
insolent	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
more	1
intolerable	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
brought	1
her	1
little	1
amusement	1
she	1
was	1
teased	1
by	1
mr	1
collins	1
who	1
continued	1
most	1
perseveringly	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
prevail	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
him	1
again	1
put	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
others	1
in	1
vain	1
did	1
she	1
entreat	1
him	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
with	1
somebody	1
else	1
and	1
offer	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
any	1
young	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
as	1
to	1
dancing	1
he	1
was	1
perfectly	1
indifferent	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
his	1
chief	1
object	1
was	1
by	1
delicate	1
attentions	1
to	1
recommend	1
himself	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
therefore	1
make	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
remaining	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
arguing	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
project	1
she	1
owed	1
her	1
greatest	1
relief	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
miss	1
lucas	1
who	1
often	1
joined	1
them	1
and	1
good	1
naturedly	1
engaged	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
conversation	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
offense	1
of	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
further	1
notice	1
though	1
often	1
standing	1
within	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
distance	1
of	1
her	1
quite	1
disengaged	1
he	1
never	1
came	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
speak	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
probable	1
consequence	1
of	1
her	1
allusions	1
to	1
mr	1
wickham	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
longbourn	1
party	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
to	1
depart	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
manoeuvre	1
of	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
their	1
carriage	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
after	1
everybody	1
else	1
was	1
gone	1
which	1
gave	1
them	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
heartily	1
they	1
were	1
wished	1
away	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
scarcely	1
opened	1
their	1
mouths	1
except	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
fatigue	1
and	1
were	1
evidently	1
impatient	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
themselves	1
they	1
repulsed	1
every	1
attempt	1
of	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
at	1
conversation	1
and	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
threw	1
a	1
languor	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
relieved	1
by	1
the	1
long	1
speeches	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
who	1
was	1
complimenting	1
mr	1
bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sisters	1
on	1
the	1
elegance	1
of	1
their	1
entertainment	1
and	1
the	1
hospitality	1
and	1
politeness	1
which	1
had	1
marked	1
their	1
behaviour	1
to	1
their	1
guests	1
darcy	1
said	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
mr	1
bennet	1
in	1
equal	1
silence	1
was	1
enjoying	1
the	1
scene	1
mr	1
bingley	1
and	1
jane	1
were	1
standing	1
together	1
a	1
little	1
detached	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
talked	1
only	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
elizabeth	1
preserved	1
as	1
steady	1
a	1
silence	1
as	1
either	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
or	1
miss	1
bingley	1
and	1
even	1
lydia	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
fatigued	1
to	1
utter	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
occasional	1
exclamation	1
of	1
lord	1
how	1
tired	1
i	1
am	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
violent	1
yawn	1
when	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
arose	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
most	1
pressingly	1
civil	1
in	1
her	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
soon	1
at	1
longbourn	1
and	1
addressed	1
herself	1
especially	1
to	1
mr	1
bingley	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
how	1

he	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
by	1
eating	1
a	1
family	1
dinner	1
with	1
them	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
without	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
a	1
formal	1
invitation	1
bingley	1
was	1
all	1
grateful	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
readily	1
engaged	1
for	1
taking	1
the	1
earliest	1
opportunity	1
of	1
waiting	1
on	1
her	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
london	1
whither	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
house	1
under	1
the	1
delightful	1
persuasion	1
that	1
allowing	1
for	1
the	1
necessary	1
preparations	1
of	1
settlements	1
new	1
carriages	1
and	1
wedding	1
clothes	1
she	1
should	1
undoubtedly	1
see	1
her	1
daughter	1
settled	1
at	1
netherfield	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
months	1
of	1
having	1
another	1
daughter	1
married	1
to	1
mr	1
collins	1
she	1
thought	1
with	1
equal	1
certainty	1
and	1
with	1
considerable	1
though	1
not	1
equal	1
pleasure	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
the	1
least	1
dear	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
children	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
match	1
were	1
quite	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
each	1
was	1
eclipsed	1
by	1
mr	1

the	1
next	1
day	1
opened	1
a	1
new	1
scene	1
at	1
longbourn	1
mr	1
collins	1
made	1
his	1
declaration	1
in	1
form	1
having	1
resolved	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
without	1
loss	1
of	1
time	1
as	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
extended	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
saturday	1
and	1
having	1
no	1
feelings	1
of	1
diffidence	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
distressing	1
to	1
himself	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
set	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
orderly	1
manner	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
observances	1
which	1
he	1
supposed	1
a	1
regular	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
on	1
finding	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
girls	1
together	1
soon	1
after	1
breakfast	1
he	1
addressed	1
the	1
mother	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
may	1
i	1
hope	1
madam	1
for	1
your	1
interest	1
with	1
your	1
fair	1
daughter	1
elizabeth	1
when	1
i	1
solicit	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
audience	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
morning	1
before	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
time	1
for	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
blush	1
of	1
surprise	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
answered	1
instantly	1
oh	1
dear	1
yes	1
certainly	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
lizzy	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
come	1
kitty	1
i	1
want	1
you	1
up	1
stairs	1
and	1
gathering	1
her	1
work	1
together	1
she	1
was	1
hastening	1
away	1
when	1
elizabeth	1
called	1
out	1
dear	1
madam	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
i	1
beg	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
mr	1
collins	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
he	1
can	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
anybody	1
need	1
not	1
hear	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
myself	1
no	1
no	1
nonsense	1
lizzy	1
i	1
desire	1
you	1
to	1
stay	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
and	1
upon	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
seeming	1
really	1
with	1
vexed	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
looks	1
about	1
to	1
escape	1
she	1
added	1
lizzy	1
i	1
insist	1
upon	1
your	1
staying	1
and	1
hearing	1
mr	1
collins	1
elizabeth	1
would	1
not	1
oppose	1
such	1
an	1
injunction	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
consideration	1
making	1
her	1
also	1
sensible	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wisest	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
over	1
as	1
soon	1
and	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
possible	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal	1
by	1
incessant	1
employment	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
were	1
divided	1
between	1
distress	1
and	1
diversion	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
and	1
kitty	1
walked	1
off	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
mr	1
collins	1
began	1
believe	1
me	1
my	1
dear	1
miss	1
elizabeth	1
that	1
your	1
modesty	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
doing	1
you	1
any	1
disservice	1
rather	1
adds	1
to	1
your	1
other	1
perfections	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
less	1
amiable	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
had	1
there	1
not	1
been	1
this	1
little	1
unwillingness	1
but	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
your	1
respected	1
mother	1
s	1
permission	1
for	1
this	1
address	1
you	1
can	1
hardly	1
doubt	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
my	1
discourse	1
however	1
your	1
natural	1
delicacy	1
may	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
dissemble	1
my	1
attentions	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
marked	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
almost	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
i	1
singled	1
you	1
out	1
as	1
the	1
companion	1
of	1
my	1
future	1
life	1
but	1
before	1
i	1
am	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
by	1
my	1
feelings	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
advisable	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
state	1
my	1
reasons	1
for	1
marrying	1
and	1
moreover	1
for	1
coming	1
into	1
hertfordshire	1
with	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
selecting	1
a	1
wife	1
as	1
i	1
certainly	1
did	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
solemn	1
composure	1
being	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
by	1
his	1
feelings	1
made	1
elizabeth	1
so	1
near	1
laughing	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
use	1
the	1
short	1
pause	1
he	1
allowed	1
in	1
any	1
attempt	1
to	1
stop	1
him	1
further	1
and	1
he	1
continued	1
my	1
reasons	1
for	1
marrying	1
are	1
first	1
that	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
right	1
thing	1
for	1
every	1
clergyman	1
in	1
easy	1
circumstances	1
like	1
myself	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
matrimony	1
in	1
his	1
parish	1
secondly	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
add	1
very	1
greatly	1
to	1
my	1
happiness	1
and	1
thirdly	1
which	1
perhaps	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
mentioned	1
earlier	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
particular	1
advice	1
and	1
recommendation	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
noble	1
lady	1
whom	1
i	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
calling	1
patroness	1
twice	1
has	1
she	1
condescended	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
her	1
opinion	1
unasked	1
too	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
saturday	1
night	1
before	1
i	1
left	1
hunsford	1
between	1
our	1
pools	1
at	1
quadrille	1
while	1
mrs	1
jenkinson	1
was	1
arranging	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
s	1
footstool	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
mr	1
collins	1
you	1
must	1
marry	1
a	1
clergyman	1
like	1
you	1
must	1
marry	1
choose	1
properly	1
choose	1
a	1
gentlewoman	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
an	1
active	1
useful	1
sort	1
of	1
person	1
not	1
brought	1
up	1
high	1
but	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
small	1
income	1
go	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
advice	1
find	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
bring	1
her	1
to	1
hunsford	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
visit	1
her	1
allow	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
observe	1
my	1
fair	1
cousin	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
reckon	1
the	1
notice	1
and	1
kindness	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
as	1
among	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
offer	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
her	1
manners	1
beyond	1
anything	1
i	1
can	1
describe	1
and	1
your	1
wit	1
and	1
vivacity	1
i	1
think	1
must	1
be	1
acceptable	1
to	1
her	1
especially	1
when	1
tempered	1
with	1
the	1
silence	1
and	1
respect	1
which	1
her	1
rank	1
will	1
inevitably	1
excite	1
thus	1
much	1
for	1
my	1
general	1
intention	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
matrimony	1
it	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
why	1
my	1
views	1
were	1
directed	1
towards	1
longbourn	1
instead	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
neighbourhood	1
where	1
i	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
amiable	1
young	1
women	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
being	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
inherit	1
this	1
estate	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
your	1
honoured	1
father	1
who	1
however	1
may	1
live	1
many	1
years	1
longer	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
without	1
resolving	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
wife	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
daughters	1
that	1
the	1
loss	1
to	1
them	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
when	1
the	1
melancholy	1
event	1
takes	1
place	1
which	1
however	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
already	1
said	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
several	1
years	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
my	1
motive	1
my	1
fair	1
cousin	1
and	1
i	1
flatter	1
myself	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
sink	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
esteem	1
and	1
now	1
nothing	1
remains	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
animated	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
my	1
affection	1
to	1
fortune	1
i	1
am	1
perfectly	1
indifferent	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
no	1
demand	1
of	1
that	1
nature	1
on	1
your	1
father	1
since	1
i	1
am	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
complied	1
with	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
per	1
cents	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
yours	1
till	1
after	1
your	1
mother	1
s	1
decease	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
ever	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
therefore	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
uniformly	1
silent	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
assure	1
yourself	1
that	1
no	1
ungenerous	1
reproach	1
shall	1
ever	1
pass	1
my	1
lips	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
married	1
it	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
interrupt	1
him	1
now	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
hasty	1
sir	1
she	1
cried	1
you	1
forget	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
let	1
me	1
do	1
it	1
without	1
further	1
loss	1
of	1
time	1
accept	1
my	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
compliment	1
you	1
are	1
paying	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sensible	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
your	1
proposals	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
otherwise	1
than	1
to	1
decline	1
them	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
now	1
to	1
learn	1
replied	1
mr	1
collins	1
with	1
a	1
formal	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
usual	1
with	1
young	1
ladies	1
to	1
reject	1
the	1
addresses	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
they	1
secretly	1
mean	1
to	1
accept	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
applies	1
for	1
their	1
favour	1
and	1
that	1
sometimes	1
the	1
refusal	1
is	1
repeated	1
a	1
second	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
i	1
am	1
therefore	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
discouraged	1
by	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
said	1
and	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
ere	1
long	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
sir	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
your	1
hope	1
is	1
a	1
rather	1
extraordinary	1
one	1
after	1
my	1
declaration	1
i	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
ladies	1
if	1
such	1
young	1
ladies	1
there	1
are	1
who	1
are	1
so	1
daring	1
as	1
to	1
risk	1
their	1
happiness	1
on	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
asked	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
i	1
am	1
perfectly	1
serious	1
in	1
my	1
refusal	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
me	1
happy	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
last	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
could	1
make	1
you	1
so	1
nay	1
were	1
your	1
friend	1
lady	1
catherine	1
to	1
know	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
persuaded	1
she	1
would	1
find	1
me	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
ill	1
qualified	1
for	1
the	1
situation	1
were	1
it	1
certain	1
that	1
lady	1
catherine	1
would	1
think	1
so	1
said	1
mr	1
collins	1
very	1
gravely	1
but	1
i	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship	1
would	1
at	1
all	1
disapprove	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
certain	1
when	1
i	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
again	1
i	1
shall	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
highest	1
terms	1
of	1
your	1
modesty	1
economy	1
and	1
other	1
amiable	1
qualification	1
indeed	1
mr	1
collins	1
all	1
praise	1
of	1
me	1
will	1
be	1
unnecessary	1
you	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
judge	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
pay	1
me	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
believing	1
what	1
i	1
say	1
i	1
wish	1
you	1
very	1
happy	1
and	1
very	1
rich	1
and	1
by	1
refusing	1
your	1
hand	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
prevent	1
your	1
being	1
otherwise	1
in	1
making	1
me	1
the	1
offer	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
satisfied	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
your	1
feelings	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
my	1
family	1
and	1
may	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
longbourn	1
estate	1
whenever	1
it	1
falls	1
without	1
any	1
self	1
reproach	1
this	1
matter	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
therefore	1
as	1
finally	1
settled	1
and	1
rising	1
as	1
she	1
thus	1
spoke	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
quitted	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
mr	1
collins	1
not	1
thus	1
addressed	1
her	1
when	1
i	1
do	1
myself	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
you	1
next	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
i	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
more	1
favourable	1
answer	1
than	1
you	1
have	1
now	1
given	1
me	1
though	1
i	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
accusing	1
you	1
of	1
cruelty	1
at	1
present	1
because	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
established	1
custom	1
of	1
your	1
sex	1
to	1
reject	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
application	1
and	1
perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
even	1
now	1
said	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
encourage	1
my	1
suit	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
consistent	1
with	1
the	1
true	1
delicacy	1
of	1
the	1
female	1
character	1
really	1
mr	1
collins	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
with	1
some	1
warmth	1
you	1
puzzle	1
me	1
exceedingly	1
if	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
hitherto	1
said	1
can	1
appear	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
encouragement	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
refusal	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
convince	1
you	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
one	1
you	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
flatter	1
myself	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin	1
that	1
your	1
refusal	1
of	1
my	1
addresses	1
is	1
merely	1
words	1
of	1
course	1
my	1
reasons	1
for	1
believing	1
it	1
are	1
briefly	1
these	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
hand	1
is	1
unworthy	1
of	1
your	1
acceptance	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
establishment	1
i	1
can	1
offer	1
would	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
than	1
highly	1
desirable	1
my	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
my	1
connections	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
de	1
bourgh	1
and	1
my	1
relationship	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
are	1
circumstances	1
highly	1
in	1
my	1
favour	1
and	1
you	1
should	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
further	1
consideration	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
your	1
manifold	1
attractions	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
certain	1
that	1
another	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
may	1
ever	1
be	1
made	1
you	1
your	1
portion	1
is	1
unhappily	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
undo	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
your	1
loveliness	1
and	1
amiable	1
qualifications	1
as	1
i	1
must	1
therefore	1
conclude	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
serious	1
in	1
your	1
rejection	1
of	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
choose	1
to	1
attribute	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
wish	1
of	1
increasing	1
my	1
love	1
by	1
suspense	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
practice	1
of	1
elegant	1
females	1
i	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
sir	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
pretensions	1
whatever	1
to	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
elegance	1
which	1
consists	1
in	1
tormenting	1
a	1
respectable	1
man	1
i	1
would	1
rather	1
be	1
paid	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
being	1
believed	1
sincere	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
proposals	1
but	1
to	1
accept	1
them	1
is	1
absolutely	1
impossible	1
my	1
feelings	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
forbid	1
it	1
can	1
i	1
speak	1
plainer	1
do	1
not	1
consider	1
me	1
now	1
as	1
an	1
elegant	1
female	1
intending	1
to	1
plague	1
you	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
rational	1
creature	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth	1
from	1
her	1
heart	1
you	1
are	1
uniformly	1
charming	1
cried	1
he	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
awkward	1

and	1
i	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
when	1
sanctioned	1
by	1
the	1
express	1
authority	1
of	1
both	1
your	1
excellent	1
parents	1
my	1
proposals	1
will	1

of	1
being	1
acceptable	1
to	1
such	1
perseverance	1

elizabeth	1
would	1
make	1
no	1

and	1
immediately	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
withdrew	1
determined	1
if	1
he	1
persisted	1
in	1
considering	1
her	1
repeated	1
refusals	1
as	1
flattering	1
encouragement	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
whose	1
negative	1
might	1
be	1
uttered	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
decisive	1
and	1
whose	1
behaviour	1
at	1
least	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
the	1
affectation	1
and	1
coquetry	1
of	1

chapter	1

mr	1
collins	1
was	1
not	1
left	1
long	1
to	1
the	1
silent	1
contemplation	1
of	1
his	1
successful	1
love	1
for	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
having	1
dawdled	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule	1
to	1
watch	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
conference	1
no	1
sooner	1
saw	1
elizabeth	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
with	1
quick	1
step	1
pass	1
her	1
towards	1
the	1
staircase	1
than	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
breakfast	1
room	1
and	1
congratulated	1
both	1
him	1
and	1
herself	1
in	1
warm	1
terms	1
on	1
the	1
happy	1
prospect	1
of	1
their	1
nearer	1
connection	1
mr	1
collins	1
received	1
and	1
returned	1
these	1
felicitations	1
with	1
equal	1
pleasure	1
and	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
relate	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
their	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
trusted	1
he	1
had	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
since	1
the	1
refusal	1
which	1
his	1
cousin	1
had	1
steadfastly	1
given	1
him	1
would	1
naturally	1
flow	1
from	1
her	1
bashful	1
modesty	1
and	1
the	1
genuine	1
delicacy	1
of	1
her	1
character	1
this	1
information	1
however	1
startled	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
satisfied	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
encourage	1
him	1
by	1
protesting	1
against	1
his	1
proposals	1
but	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
so	1
but	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
mr	1
collins	1
she	1
added	1
that	1
lizzy	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
reason	1
i	1
will	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
it	1
directly	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
headstrong	1
foolish	1
girl	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
own	1
interest	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
know	1
it	1
pardon	1
me	1
for	1
interrupting	1
you	1
madam	1
cried	1
mr	1
collins	1
but	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
really	1
headstrong	1
and	1
foolish	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
altogether	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
desirable	1
wife	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
my	1
situation	1
who	1
naturally	1
looks	1
for	1
happiness	1
in	1
the	1
marriage	1
state	1
if	1
therefore	1
she	1
actually	1
persists	1
in	1
rejecting	1
my	1
suit	1
perhaps	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
into	1
accepting	1
me	1
because	1
if	1
liable	1
to	1
such	1
defects	1
of	1
temper	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
contribute	1
much	1
to	1
my	1
felicity	1
sir	1
you	1
quite	1
misunderstand	1
me	1
said	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
alarmed	1
lizzy	1
is	1
only	1
headstrong	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
as	1
these	1
in	1
everything	1
else	1
she	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
natured	1
a	1
girl	1
as	1
ever	1
lived	1
i	1
will	1
go	1
directly	1
to	1
mr	1
bennet	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
very	1
soon	1
settle	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
reply	1
but	1
hurrying	1
instantly	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
called	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
library	1
oh	1
mr	1
bennet	1
you	1
are	1
wanted	1
immediately	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
an	1
uproar	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
and	1
make	1
lizzy	1
marry	1
mr	1
collins	1
for	1
she	1
vows	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
him	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
haste	1
he	1
will	1
change	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
her	1
mr	1
bennet	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
his	1
book	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
and	1
fixed	1
them	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
calm	1
unconcern	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
altered	1
by	1
her	1
communication	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
understanding	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
her	1
speech	1
of	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
and	1
lizzy	1
lizzy	1
declares	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
mr	1
collins	1
and	1
mr	1
collins	1
begins	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
lizzy	1
and	1
what	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
it	1
seems	1
an	1
hopeless	1
business	1
speak	1
to	1
lizzy	1
about	1
it	1
yourself	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
you	1
insist	1
upon	1
her	1
marrying	1
him	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
called	1
down	1
she	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
opinion	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
miss	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
the	1
library	1
come	1
here	1
child	1
cried	1
her	1
father	1
as	1
she	1
appeared	1
i	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
you	1
on	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
importance	1
i	1
understand	1
that	1
mr	1
collins	1
has	1
made	1
you	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
elizabeth	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
this	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
you	1
have	1
refused	1
i	1
have	1
sir	1
very	1
well	1
we	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
your	1
mother	1
insists	1
upon	1
your	1
accepting	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
yes	1
or	1
i	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
her	1
again	1
an	1
unhappy	1
alternative	1
is	1
before	1
you	1
elizabeth	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
stranger	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
parents	1
your	1
mother	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
marry	1
mr	1
collins	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
smile	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
conclusion	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
beginning	1
but	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
who	1
had	1
persuaded	1
herself	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
regarded	1
the	1
affair	1
as	1
she	1
wished	1
was	1
excessively	1
disappointed	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
mr	1
bennet	1
in	1
talking	1
this	1
way	1
you	1
promised	1
me	1
to	1
insist	1
upon	1
her	1
marrying	1
him	1
my	1
dear	1
replied	1
her	1
husband	1
i	1
have	1
two	1
small	1
favours	1
to	1
request	1
first	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
the	1
free	1
use	1
of	1
my	1
understanding	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion	1
and	1
secondly	1
of	1
my	1
room	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
library	1
to	1
myself	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
not	1
yet	1
however	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
disappointment	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
did	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
point	1
she	1
talked	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
coaxed	1
and	1
threatened	1
her	1
by	1
turns	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
secure	1
jane	1
in	1
her	1
interest	1
but	1
jane	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
mildness	1
declined	1
interfering	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
sometimes	1
with	1
real	1
earnestness	1
and	1
sometimes	1
with	1
playful	1
gaiety	1
replied	1
to	1
her	1
attacks	1
though	1
her	1
manner	1
varied	1
however	1
her	1
determination	1
never	1
did	1
mr	1
collins	1
meanwhile	1
was	1
meditating	1
in	1
solitude	1
on	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
he	1
thought	1
too	1
well	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
comprehend	1
on	1
what	1
motives	1
his	1
cousin	1
could	1
refuse	1
him	1
and	1
though	1
his	1
pride	1
was	1
hurt	1
he	1
suffered	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
his	1
regard	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
quite	1
imaginary	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
her	1
deserving	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
reproach	1
prevented	1
his	1
feeling	1
any	1
regret	1
while	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
in	1
this	1
confusion	1
charlotte	1
lucas	1
came	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
day	1
with	1
them	1
she	1
was	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule	1
by	1
lydia	1
who	1
flying	1
to	1
her	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
fun	1
here	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
has	1
happened	1
this	1
morning	1
mr	1
collins	1
has	1
made	1
an	1
offer	1
to	1
lizzy	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
him	1
charlotte	1
hardly	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
answer	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
kitty	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
same	1
news	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
breakfast	1
room	1
where	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
alone	1
than	1
she	1
likewise	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
calling	1
on	1
miss	1
lucas	1
for	1
her	1
compassion	1
and	1
entreating	1
her	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
friend	1
lizzy	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
family	1
pray	1
do	1
my	1
dear	1
miss	1
lucas	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
melancholy	1
tone	1
for	1
nobody	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
nobody	1
takes	1
part	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
cruelly	1
used	1
nobody	1
feels	1
for	1
my	1
poor	1
nerves	1
charlotte	1
s	1
reply	1
was	1
spared	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
jane	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
aye	1
there	1
she	1
comes	1
continued	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
looking	1
as	1
unconcerned	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
and	1
caring	1
no	1
more	1
for	1
us	1
than	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
york	1
provided	1
she	1
can	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
way	1
but	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
miss	1
lizzy	1
if	1
you	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
head	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
refusing	1
every	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
get	1
a	1
husband	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
maintain	1
you	1
when	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
dead	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
and	1
so	1
i	1
warn	1
you	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
you	1
from	1
this	1
very	1
day	1
i	1
told	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
library	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
never	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
again	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
me	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
my	1
word	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
undutiful	1
children	1
not	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
much	1
pleasure	1
indeed	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
anybody	1
people	1
who	1
suffer	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
from	1
nervous	1
complaints	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
great	1
inclination	1
for	1
talking	1
nobody	1
can	1
tell	1
what	1
i	1
suffer	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
complain	1
are	1
never	1
pitied	1
her	1
daughters	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
this	1
effusion	1
sensible	1
that	1
any	1
attempt	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
her	1
or	1
soothe	1
her	1
would	1
only	1
increase	1
the	1
irritation	1
she	1
talked	1
on	1
therefore	1
without	1
interruption	1
from	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
mr	1
collins	1
who	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
more	1
stately	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
on	1
perceiving	1
whom	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
girls	1
now	1
i	1
do	1
insist	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
hold	1
your	1
tongues	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
and	1
mr	1
collins	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
conversation	1
together	1
elizabeth	1
passed	1
quietly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
jane	1
and	1
kitty	1
followed	1
but	1
lydia	1
stood	1
her	1
ground	1
determined	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
and	1
charlotte	1
detained	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
civility	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
whose	1
inquiries	1
after	1
herself	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
family	1
were	1
very	1
minute	1
and	1
then	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
curiosity	1
satisfied	1
herself	1
with	1
walking	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
in	1
a	1
doleful	1
voice	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
began	1
the	1
projected	1
conversation	1
oh	1
mr	1
collins	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1
replied	1
he	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
for	1
ever	1
silent	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
me	1
he	1
presently	1
continued	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
marked	1
his	1
displeasure	1
to	1
resent	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
your	1
daughter	1
resignation	1
to	1
inevitable	1
evils	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
peculiar	1
duty	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
early	1
preferment	1
and	1
i	1
trust	1
i	1
am	1
resigned	1
perhaps	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
so	1
from	1
feeling	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
my	1
positive	1
happiness	1
had	1
my	1
fair	1
cousin	1
honoured	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
for	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
observed	1
that	1
resignation	1
is	1
never	1
so	1
perfect	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
blessing	1
denied	1
begins	1
to	1
lose	1
somewhat	1
of	1
its	1
value	1
in	1
our	1
estimation	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
i	1
hope	1
consider	1
me	1
as	1
showing	1
any	1
disrespect	1
to	1
your	1
family	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1
by	1
thus	1
withdrawing	1
my	1
pretensions	1
to	1
your	1
daughter	1
s	1
favour	1
without	1
having	1
paid	1
yourself	1
and	1
mr	1
bennet	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
requesting	1
you	1
to	1
interpose	1
your	1
authority	1
in	1
my	1
behalf	1
my	1
conduct	1
may	1
i	1
fear	1
be	1
objectionable	1
in	1
having	1
accepted	1
my	1
dismission	1
from	1
your	1
daughter	1
s	1
lips	1
instead	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
liable	1
to	1
error	1
i	1
have	1
certainly	1
meant	1
well	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
my	1
object	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
secure	1
an	1
amiable	1
companion	1
for	1
myself	1
with	1
due	1
consideration	1
for	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
family	1
and	1
if	1
my	1
manner	1
has	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
reprehensible	1
i	1
here	1
beg	1
leave	1
to	1
apologise	1
chapter	1
21	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
offer	1
was	1
now	1
nearly	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
uncomfortable	1
feelings	1
necessarily	1
attending	1
it	1
and	1
occasionally	1
from	1
some	1
peevish	1
allusions	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
chiefly	1
expressed	1
not	1
by	1
embarrassment	1
or	1
dejection	1
or	1
by	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
her	1
but	1
by	1
stiffness	1
of	1
manner	1
and	1
resentful	1
silence	1
he	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
assiduous	1
attentions	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
sensible	1
of	1
himself	1
were	1
transferred	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
to	1
miss	1
lucas	1
whose	1
civility	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
seasonable	1
relief	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
the	1
morrow	1
produced	1
no	1
abatement	1
of	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
s	1
ill	1
humour	1
or	1
ill	1
health	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
angry	1
pride	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
hoped	1
that	1
his	1
resentment	1
might	1
shorten	1
his	1
visit	1
but	1
his	1
plan	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
affected	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
saturday	1
and	1
to	1
saturday	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
stay	1
after	1
breakfast	1
the	1
girls	1
walked	1
to	1
meryton	1
to	1
inquire	1
if	1
mr	1
wickham	1
were	1
returned	1
and	1
to	1
lament	1
over	1
his	1
absence	1
from	1
the	1
netherfield	1
ball	1
he	1
joined	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
entering	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
attended	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
aunt	1
s	1
where	1
his	1
regret	1
and	1
vexation	1
and	1
the	1
concern	1
of	1
everybody	1
was	1
well	1
talked	1
over	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
however	1
he	1
voluntarily	1
acknowledged	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
had	1
been	1
self	1
imposed	1
i	1
found	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
drew	1
near	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
meet	1
mr	1
darcy	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room	1
the	1
same	1
party	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
together	1
might	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
i	1
could	1
bear	1
and	1
that	1
scenes	1
might	1
arise	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
myself	1
she	1
highly	1
approved	1
his	1
forbearance	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
leisure	1
for	1
a	1
full	1
discussion	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
commendation	1
which	1
they	1
civilly	1
bestowed	1
on	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
wickham	1
and	1
another	1
officer	1
walked	1
back	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
longbourn	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
walk	1
he	1
particularly	1
attended	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
accompanying	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
double	1
advantage	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
compliment	1
it	1
offered	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
acceptable	1
as	1
an	1
occasion	1
of	1
introducing	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
soon	1
after	1
their	1
return	1
a	1
letter	1
was	1
delivered	1
to	1
miss	1
bennet	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
netherfield	1
the	1
envelope	1
contained	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
elegant	1
little	1
hot	1
pressed	1
paper	1
well	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
lady	1
s	1
fair	1
flowing	1
hand	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
saw	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
countenance	1
change	1
as	1
she	1
read	1
it	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
dwelling	1
intently	1
on	1
some	1
particular	1
passages	1
jane	1
recollected	1
herself	1
soon	1
and	1
putting	1
the	1
letter	1
away	1
tried	1
to	1
join	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
cheerfulness	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
but	1
elizabeth	1
felt	1
an	1
anxiety	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
which	1
drew	1
off	1
her	1
attention	1
even	1
from	1
wickham	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
taken	1
leave	1
than	1
a	1
glance	1
from	1
jane	1
invited	1
her	1
to	1
follow	1
her	1
up	1
stairs	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gained	1
their	1
own	1
room	1
jane	1
taking	1
out	1
the	1
letter	1
said	1
this	1
is	1
from	1
caroline	1
bingley	1
what	1
it	1
contains	1
has	1
surprised	1
me	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
have	1
left	1
netherfield	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
are	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
town	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
coming	1
back	1
again	1
you	1
shall	1
hear	1
what	1
she	1
says	1
she	1
then	1
read	1
the	1
first	1
sentence	1
aloud	1
which	1
comprised	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
their	1
having	1
just	1
resolved	1
to	1
follow	1
their	1
brother	1
to	1
town	1
directly	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
meaning	1
to	1
dine	1
in	1
grosvenor	1
street	1
where	1
mr	1
hurst	1
had	1
a	1
house	1
the	1
next	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
regret	1
anything	1
i	1
shall	1
leave	1
in	1
hertfordshire	1
except	1
your	1
society	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
hope	1
at	1
some	1
future	1
period	1
to	1
enjoy	1
many	1
returns	1
of	1
that	1
delightful	1
intercourse	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meanwhile	1
may	1
lessen	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
separation	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
frequent	1
and	1
most	1
unreserved	1
correspondence	1
i	1
depend	1
on	1
you	1
for	1
that	1
to	1
these	1
highflown	1
expressions	1
elizabeth	1
listened	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
insensibility	1
of	1
distrust	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
suddenness	1
of	1
their	1
removal	1
surprised	1
her	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
really	1
to	1
lament	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
their	1
absence	1
from	1
netherfield	1
would	1
prevent	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
being	1
there	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
society	1
she	1
was	1
persuaded	1
that	1
jane	1
must	1
cease	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
his	1
it	1
is	1
unlucky	1
said	1
she	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
friends	1
before	1
they	1
leave	1
the	1
country	1
but	1
may	1
we	1
not	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
future	1
happiness	1
to	1
which	1
miss	1
bingley	1
looks	1
forward	1
may	1
arrive	1
earlier	1
than	1
she	1
is	1
aware	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
delightful	1
intercourse	1
you	1
have	1
known	1
as	1
friends	1
will	1
be	1
renewed	1
with	1
yet	1
greater	1
satisfaction	1
as	1
sisters	1
mr	1
bingley	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
detained	1
in	1
london	1
by	1
them	1
caroline	1
decidedly	1
says	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
will	1
return	1
into	1
hertfordshire	1
this	1
winter	1
i	1
will	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
when	1
my	1
brother	1
left	1
us	1
yesterday	1
he	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
business	1
which	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
london	1
might	1
be	1
concluded	1
in	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
certain	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
convinced	1
that	1
when	1
charles	1
gets	1
to	1
town	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
no	1
hurry	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
again	1
we	1
have	1
determined	1
on	1
following	1
him	1
thither	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
vacant	1
hours	1
in	1
a	1
comfortless	1
hotel	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintances	1
are	1
already	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
winter	1
i	1
wish	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
that	1
you	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend	1
had	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
making	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
but	1
of	1
that	1
i	1
despair	1
i	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
your	1
christmas	1
in	1
hertfordshire	1
may	1
abound	1
in	1
the	1
gaieties	1
which	1
that	1
season	1
generally	1
brings	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
beaux	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
numerous	1
as	1
to	1
prevent	1
your	1
feeling	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
shall	1
deprive	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
by	1
this	1
added	1
jane	1
that	1
he	1
comes	1
back	1
no	1
more	1
this	1
winter	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
evident	1
that	1
miss	1
bingley	1
does	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
why	1
will	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
own	1
doing	1
he	1
is	1
his	1
own	1
master	1
but	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
all	1
i	1
will	1
read	1
you	1
the	1
passage	1
which	1
particularly	1
hurts	1
me	1
i	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
reserves	1
from	1
you	1
mr	1
darcy	1
is	1
impatient	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
to	1
confess	1
the	1
truth	1
we	1
are	1
scarcely	1
less	1
eager	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
again	1
i	1
really	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
georgiana	1
darcy	1
has	1
her	1
equal	1
for	1
beauty	1
elegance	1
and	1
accomplishments	1
and	1
the	1
affection	1
she	1
inspires	1
in	1
louisa	1
and	1
myself	1
is	1
heightened	1
into	1
something	1
still	1
more	1
interesting	1
from	1
the	1
hope	1
we	1
dare	1
entertain	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
hereafter	1
our	1
sister	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
i	1
ever	1
before	1
mentioned	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
feelings	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
country	1
without	1
confiding	1
them	1
and	1
i	1
trust	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
esteem	1
them	1
unreasonable	1
my	1
brother	1
admires	1
her	1
greatly	1
already	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
frequent	1
opportunity	1
now	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
footing	1
her	1
relations	1
all	1
wish	1
the	1
connection	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
a	1
sister	1
s	1
partiality	1
is	1
not	1
misleading	1
me	1
i	1
think	1
when	1
i	1
call	1
charles	1
most	1
capable	1
of	1
engaging	1
any	1
woman	1
s	1
heart	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
circumstances	1
to	1
favour	1
an	1
attachment	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
it	1
am	1
i	1
wrong	1
my	1
dearest	1
jane	1
in	1
indulging	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
an	1
event	1
which	1
will	1
secure	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
sentence	1
my	1
dear	1
lizzy	1
said	1
jane	1
as	1
she	1
finished	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
clear	1
enough	1
does	1
it	1
not	1
expressly	1
declare	1
that	1
caroline	1
neither	1
expects	1
nor	1
wishes	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
indifference	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
suspects	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
my	1
feelings	1
for	1
him	1
she	1
means	1
most	1
kindly	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
guard	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
yes	1
there	1
can	1
for	1
mine	1
is	1
totally	1
different	1
will	1
you	1
hear	1
it	1
most	1
willingly	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
miss	1
bingley	1
sees	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
is	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
wants	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
miss	1
darcy	1
she	1
follows	1
him	1
to	1
town	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
keeping	1
him	1
there	1
and	1
tries	1
to	1
persuade	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
you	1
jane	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
indeed	1
jane	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
believe	1
me	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
ever	1
seen	1
you	1
together	1
can	1
doubt	1
his	1
affection	1
miss	1
bingley	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
cannot	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
simpleton	1
could	1
she	1
have	1
seen	1
half	1
as	1
much	1
love	1
in	1
mr	1
darcy	1
for	1
herself	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
ordered	1
her	1
wedding	1
clothes	1
but	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
this	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
rich	1
enough	1
or	1
grand	1
enough	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
miss	1
darcy	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
from	1
the	1
notion	1
that	1
when	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
one	1
intermarriage	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
less	1
trouble	1
in	1
achieving	1
a	1
second	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
certainly	1
some	1
ingenuity	1
and	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
it	1
would	1
succeed	1
if	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
but	1
my	1
dearest	1
jane	1
you	1
cannot	1
seriously	1
imagine	1
that	1
because	1
miss	1
bingley	1
tells	1
you	1
her	1
brother	1
greatly	1
admires	1
miss	1
darcy	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
smallest	1
degree	1
less	1
sensible	1
of	1
your	1
merit	1
than	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
you	1
on	1
tuesday	1
or	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
if	1
we	1
thought	1
alike	1
of	1
miss	1
bingley	1
replied	1
jane	1
your	1
representation	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
might	1
make	1
me	1
quite	1
easy	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
the	1
foundation	1
is	1
unjust	1
caroline	1
is	1
incapable	1
of	1
wilfully	1
deceiving	1
anyone	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
hope	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
deceiving	1
herself	1
that	1
is	1
right	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
started	1
a	1
more	1
happy	1
idea	1
since	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
comfort	1
in	1
mine	1
believe	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
deceived	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
you	1
have	1
now	1
done	1
your	1
duty	1
by	1
her	1
and	1
must	1
fret	1
no	1
longer	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
can	1
i	1
be	1
happy	1
even	1
supposing	1
the	1
best	1
in	1
accepting	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
sisters	1
and	1
friends	1
are	1
all	1
wishing	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
elsewhere	1
you	1
must	1
decide	1
for	1
yourself	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
if	1
upon	1
mature	1
deliberation	1
you	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
disobliging	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
equivalent	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
being	1
his	1
wife	1
i	1
advise	1
you	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
to	1
refuse	1
him	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
so	1
said	1
jane	1
faintly	1
smiling	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
though	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
grieved	1
at	1
their	1
disapprobation	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
hesitate	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
would	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
the	1
case	1
i	1
cannot	1
consider	1
your	1
situation	1
with	1
much	1
compassion	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
returns	1
no	1
more	1
this	1
winter	1
my	1
choice	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
required	1
a	1
thousand	1
things	1
may	1
arise	1
in	1
six	1
months	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
returning	1
no	1
more	1
elizabeth	1
treated	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
contempt	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
merely	1
the	1
suggestion	1
of	1
caroline	1
s	1
interested	1
wishes	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
suppose	1
that	1
those	1
wishes	1
however	1
openly	1
or	1
artfully	1
spoken	1
could	1
influence	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
so	1
totally	1
independent	1
of	1
everyone	1
she	1
represented	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
as	1
forcibly	1
as	1
possible	1
what	1
she	1
felt	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
had	1
soon	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
its	1
happy	1
effect	1
jane	1
s	1
temper	1
was	1
not	1
desponding	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
gradually	1
led	1
to	1
hope	1
though	1
the	1
diffidence	1
of	1
affection	1
sometimes	1
overcame	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
bingley	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
netherfield	1
and	1
answer	1
every	1
wish	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
they	1
agreed	1
that	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
should	1
only	1
hear	1
of	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
without	1
being	1
alarmed	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
s	1
conduct	1
but	1
even	1
this	1
partial	1
communication	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
concern	1
and	1
she	1
bewailed	1
it	1
as	1
exceedingly	1
unlucky	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
getting	1
so	1
intimate	1
together	1
after	1
lamenting	1
it	1
however	1
at	1
some	1
length	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
consolation	1
that	1
mr	1
bingley	1
would	1
be	1
soon	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
soon	1
dining	1
at	1
longbourn	1
and	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
comfortable	1
declaration	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
invited	1
only	1
to	1
a	1
family	1
dinner	1
she	1
would	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
full	1
courses	1
chapter	1
22	1
the	1
bennets	1
were	1
engaged	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
lucases	1
and	1
again	1
during	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
miss	1
lucas	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
mr	1
collins	1
elizabeth	1
took	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
thanking	1
her	1
it	1
keeps	1
him	1
in	1
good	1
humour	1
said	1
she	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
more	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
than	1
i	1
can	1
express	1
charlotte	1
assured	1
her	1
friend	1
of	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
being	1
useful	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
amply	1
repaid	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
her	1
time	1
this	1
was	1
very	1
amiable	1
but	1
charlotte	1
s	1
kindness	1
extended	1
farther	1
than	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
any	1
conception	1
of	1
its	1
object	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
than	1
to	1
secure	1
her	1
from	1
any	1
return	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
addresses	1
by	1
engaging	1
them	1
towards	1
herself	1
such	1
was	1
miss	1
lucas	1
s	1
scheme	1
and	1
appearances	1
were	1
so	1
favourable	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
parted	1
at	1
night	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
almost	1
secure	1
of	1
success	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
leave	1
hertfordshire	1
so	1
very	1
soon	1
but	1
here	1
she	1
did	1
injustice	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
independence	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
for	1
it	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
longbourn	1
house	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
with	1
admirable	1
slyness	1
and	1
hasten	1
to	1
lucas	1
lodge	1
to	1
throw	1
himself	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
cousins	1
from	1
a	1
conviction	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
depart	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
conjecture	1
his	1
design	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
attempt	1
known	1
till	1
its	1
success	1
might	1
be	1
known	1
likewise	1
for	1
though	1
feeling	1
almost	1
secure	1
and	1
with	1
reason	1
for	1
charlotte	1
had	1
been	1
tolerably	1
encouraging	1
he	1
was	1
comparatively	1
diffident	1
since	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
wednesday	1
his	1
reception	1
however	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
flattering	1
kind	1
miss	1
lucas	1
perceived	1
him	1
from	1
an	1
upper	1
window	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
instantly	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
accidentally	1
in	1
the	1
lane	1
but	1
little	1
had	1
she	1
dared	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
love	1
and	1
eloquence	1
awaited	1
her	1
there	1
in	1
as	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
as	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
long	1
speeches	1
would	1
allow	1
everything	1
was	1
settled	1
between	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
both	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
earnestly	1
entreated	1
her	1
to	1
name	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
though	1
such	1
a	1
solicitation	1
must	1
be	1
waived	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
the	1
lady	1
felt	1
no	1
inclination	1
to	1
trifle	1
with	1
his	1
happiness	1
the	1
stupidity	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
favoured	1
by	1
nature	1
must	1
guard	1
his	1
courtship	1
from	1
any	1
charm	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
a	1
woman	1
wish	1
for	1
its	1
continuance	1
and	1
miss	1
lucas	1
who	1
accepted	1
him	1
solely	1
from	1
the	1
pure	1
and	1
disinterested	1
desire	1
of	1
an	1
establishment	1
cared	1
not	1
how	1
soon	1
that	1
establishment	1
were	1
gained	1
sir	1
william	1
and	1
lady	1
lucas	1
were	1
speedily	1
applied	1
to	1
for	1
their	1
consent	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
bestowed	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
joyful	1
alacrity	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
present	1
circumstances	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
most	1
eligible	1
match	1
for	1
their	1
daughter	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
could	1
give	1
little	1
fortune	1
and	1
his	1
prospects	1
of	1
future	1
wealth	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
fair	1
lady	1
lucas	1
began	1
directly	1
to	1
calculate	1
with	1
more	1
interest	1
than	1
the	1
matter	1
had	1
ever	1
excited	1
before	1
how	1
many	1
years	1
longer	1
mr	1
bennet	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
sir	1
william	1
gave	1
it	1
as	1
his	1
decided	1
opinion	1
that	1
whenever	1
mr	1
collins	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
longbourn	1
estate	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
highly	1
expedient	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
should	1
make	1
their	1
appearance	1
at	1
st	1
james	1
s	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
in	1
short	1
were	1
properly	1
overjoyed	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
the	1
younger	1
girls	1
formed	1
hopes	1
of	1
coming	1
out	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
sooner	1
than	1
they	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
done	1
and	1
the	1
boys	1
were	1
relieved	1
from	1
their	1
apprehension	1
of	1
charlotte	1
s	1
dying	1
an	1
old	1
maid	1
charlotte	1
herself	1
was	1
tolerably	1
composed	1
she	1
had	1
gained	1
her	1
point	1
and	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
of	1
it	1
her	1
reflections	1
were	1
in	1
general	1
satisfactory	1
mr	1
collins	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
was	1
neither	1
sensible	1
nor	1
agreeable	1
his	1
society	1
was	1
irksome	1
and	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
her	1
must	1
be	1
imaginary	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
her	1
husband	1
without	1
thinking	1
highly	1
either	1
of	1
men	1
or	1
matrimony	1
marriage	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
her	1
object	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
provision	1
for	1
well	1
educated	1
young	1
women	1
of	1
small	1
fortune	1
and	1
however	1
uncertain	1
of	1
giving	1
happiness	1
must	1
be	1
their	1
pleasantest	1
preservative	1
from	1
want	1
this	1
preservative	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
obtained	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
twenty	1
seven	1
without	1
having	1
ever	1
been	1
handsome	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
luck	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
least	1
agreeable	1
circumstance	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
was	1
the	1
surprise	1
it	1
must	1
occasion	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
bennet	1
whose	1
friendship	1
she	1
valued	1
beyond	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
elizabeth	1
would	1
wonder	1
and	1
probably	1
would	1
blame	1
her	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
resolution	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
her	1
feelings	1
must	1
be	1
hurt	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
disapprobation	1
she	1
resolved	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
information	1
herself	1
and	1
therefore	1
charged	1
mr	1
collins	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
longbourn	1
to	1
dinner	1
to	1
drop	1
no	1
hint	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
secrecy	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
very	1
dutifully	1
given	1
but	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
without	1
difficulty	1
for	1
the	1
curiosity	1
excited	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
absence	1
burst	1
forth	1
in	1
such	1
very	1
direct	1
questions	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
as	1
required	1
some	1
ingenuity	1
to	1
evade	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
exercising	1
great	1
self	1
denial	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
publish	1
his	1
prosperous	1
love	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
begin	1
his	1
journey	1
too	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
leave	1
taking	1
was	1
performed	1
when	1
the	1
ladies	1
moved	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
with	1
great	1
politeness	1
and	1
cordiality	1
said	1
how	1
happy	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
longbourn	1
again	1
whenever	1
his	1
engagements	1
might	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
visit	1
them	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1
he	1
replied	1
this	1
invitation	1
is	1
particularly	1
gratifying	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
hoping	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
certain	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
avail	1
myself	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
astonished	1
and	1
mr	1
bennet	1
who	1
could	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
wish	1
for	1
so	1
speedy	1
a	1
return	1
immediately	1
said	1
but	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
danger	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
s	1
disapprobation	1
here	1
my	1
good	1
sir	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
neglect	1
your	1
relations	1
than	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
offending	1
your	1
patroness	1
my	1
dear	1
sir	1
replied	1
mr	1
collins	1
i	1
am	1
particularly	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
this	1
friendly	1
caution	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
my	1
not	1
taking	1
so	1
material	1
a	1
step	1
without	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
concurrence	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
upon	1
your	1
guard	1
risk	1
anything	1
rather	1
than	1
her	1
displeasure	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
by	1
your	1
coming	1
to	1
us	1
again	1
which	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
exceedingly	1
probable	1
stay	1
quietly	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
take	1
no	1
offence	1
believe	1
me	1
my	1
dear	1
sir	1
my	1
gratitude	1
is	1
warmly	1
excited	1
by	1
such	1
affectionate	1
attention	1
and	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
you	1
will	1
speedily	1
receive	1
from	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
thanks	1
for	1
this	1
and	1
for	1
every	1
other	1
mark	1
of	1
your	1
regard	1
during	1
my	1
stay	1
in	1
hertfordshire	1
as	1
for	1
my	1
fair	1
cousins	1
though	1
my	1
absence	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
necessary	1
i	1
shall	1
now	1
take	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
wishing	1
them	1
health	1
and	1
happiness	1
not	1
excepting	1
my	1
cousin	1
elizabeth	1
with	1
proper	1
civilities	1
the	1
ladies	1
then	1
withdrew	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
equally	1
surprised	1
that	1
he	1
meditated	1
a	1
quick	1
return	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
wished	1
to	1
understand	1
by	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
paying	1
his	1
addresses	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
younger	1
girls	1
and	1
mary	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
accept	1
him	1
she	1
rated	1
his	1
abilities	1
much	1
higher	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
solidity	1
in	1
his	1
reflections	1
which	1
often	1
struck	1
her	1
and	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
clever	1
as	1
herself	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
encouraged	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
improve	1
himself	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
example	1
as	1
hers	1
he	1
might	1
become	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
companion	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
morning	1
every	1
hope	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
was	1
done	1
away	1
miss	1
lucas	1
called	1
soon	1
after	1
breakfast	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
private	1
conference	1
with	1
elizabeth	1
related	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
fancying	1
himself	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
had	1
once	1
occurred	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
but	1
that	1
charlotte	1
could	1
encourage	1
him	1
seemed	1
almost	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
possibility	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
encourage	1
him	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
astonishment	1
was	1
consequently	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
to	1
overcome	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
decorum	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
crying	1
out	1
engaged	1
to	1
mr	1
collins	1
my	1
dear	1
charlotte	1
impossible	1
the	1
steady	1
countenance	1
which	1
miss	1
lucas	1
had	1
commanded	1
in	1
telling	1
her	1
story	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
a	1
momentary	1
confusion	1
here	1
on	1
receiving	1
so	1
direct	1
a	1
reproach	1
though	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
expected	1
she	1
soon	1
regained	1
her	1
composure	1
and	1
calmly	1
replied	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
surprised	1
my	1
dear	1
eliza	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
incredible	1
that	1
mr	1
collins	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
procure	1
any	1
woman	1
s	1
good	1
opinion	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
happy	1
as	1
to	1
succeed	1
with	1
you	1
but	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
now	1
recollected	1
herself	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
strong	1
effort	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
assure	1
with	1
tolerable	1
firmness	1
that	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
their	1
relationship	1
was	1
highly	1
grateful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
her	1
all	1
imaginable	1
happiness	1
i	1
see	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
feeling	1
replied	1
charlotte	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
surprised	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
so	1
lately	1
as	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
wishing	1
to	1
marry	1
you	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
romantic	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
never	1
was	1
i	1
ask	1
only	1
a	1
comfortable	1
home	1
and	1
considering	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
character	1
connection	1
and	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
i	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
my	1
chance	1
of	1
happiness	1
with	1
him	1
is	1
as	1
fair	1
as	1
most	1
people	1
can	1
boast	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
marriage	1
state	1
elizabeth	1
quietly	1
answered	1
undoubtedly	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
awkward	1
pause	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
charlotte	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
much	1
longer	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
then	1
left	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
she	1
became	1
at	1
all	1
reconciled	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
so	1
unsuitable	1
a	1
match	1
the	1
strangeness	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
making	1
two	1
offers	1
of	1
marriage	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
now	1
accepted	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
charlotte	1
s	1
opinion	1
of	1
matrimony	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
like	1
her	1
own	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
possible	1
that	1
when	1
called	1
into	1
action	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
every	1
better	1
feeling	1
to	1
worldly	1
advantage	1
charlotte	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
humiliating	1
picture	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
pang	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
disgracing	1
herself	1
and	1
sunk	1
in	1
her	1
esteem	1
was	1
added	1
the	1
distressing	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
that	1
friend	1
to	1
be	1
tolerably	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
lot	1
she	1
had	1
chosen	1
chapter	1
23	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters	1
reflecting	1
on	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
doubting	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
authorised	1
to	1
mention	1
it	1
when	1
sir	1
william	1
lucas	1
himself	1
appeared	1
sent	1
by	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
announce	1
her	1
engagement	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
with	1
many	1
compliments	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
much	1
self	1
gratulation	1
on	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
houses	1
he	1
unfolded	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
an	1
audience	1
not	1
merely	1
wondering	1
but	1
incredulous	1
for	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
with	1
more	1
perseverance	1
than	1
politeness	1
protested	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
entirely	1
mistaken	1
and	1
lydia	1
always	1
unguarded	1
and	1
often	1
uncivil	1
boisterously	1
exclaimed	1
good	1
lord	1
sir	1
william	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
such	1
a	1
story	1
do	1
not	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
mr	1
collins	1
wants	1
to	1
marry	1
lizzy	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
complaisance	1
of	1
a	1
courtier	1
could	1
have	1
borne	1
without	1
anger	1
such	1
treatment	1
but	1
sir	1
william	1
s	1
good	1
breeding	1
carried	1
him	1
through	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
begged	1
leave	1
to	1
be	1
positive	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
information	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
impertinence	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
forbearing	1
courtesy	1
elizabeth	1
feeling	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
relieve	1
him	1
from	1
so	1
unpleasant	1
a	1
situation	1
now	1
put	1
herself	1
forward	1
to	1
confirm	1
his	1
account	1
by	1
mentioning	1
her	1
prior	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it	1
from	1
charlotte	1
herself	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
exclamations	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters	1
by	1
the	1
earnestness	1
of	1
her	1
congratulations	1
to	1
sir	1
william	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
readily	1
joined	1
by	1
jane	1
and	1
by	1
making	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
remarks	1
on	1
the	1
happiness	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
the	1
match	1
the	1
excellent	1
character	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
and	1
the	1
convenient	1
distance	1
of	1
hunsford	1
from	1
london	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
too	1
much	1
overpowered	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
while	1
sir	1
william	1
remained	1
but	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
left	1
them	1
than	1
her	1
feelings	1
found	1
a	1
rapid	1
vent	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
she	1
persisted	1
in	1
disbelieving	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
secondly	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
mr	1
collins	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
thirdly	1
she	1
trusted	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
happy	1
together	1
and	1
fourthly	1
that	1
the	1
match	1
might	1
be	1
broken	1
off	1
two	1
inferences	1
however	1
were	1
plainly	1
deduced	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
one	1
that	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
mischief	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
been	1
barbarously	1
misused	1
by	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
two	1
points	1
she	1
principally	1
dwelt	1
during	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
nothing	1
could	1
console	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
appease	1
her	1
nor	1
did	1
that	1
day	1
wear	1
out	1
her	1
resentment	1
a	1
week	1
elapsed	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
elizabeth	1
without	1
scolding	1
her	1
a	1
month	1
passed	1
away	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
speak	1
to	1
sir	1
william	1
or	1
lady	1
lucas	1
without	1
being	1
rude	1
and	1
many	1
months	1
were	1
gone	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
at	1
all	1
forgive	1
their	1
daughter	1
mr	1
bennet	1
s	1
emotions	1
were	1
much	1
more	1
tranquil	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
experience	1
he	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
agreeable	1
sort	1
for	1
it	1
gratified	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
discover	1
that	1
charlotte	1
lucas	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
tolerably	1
sensible	1
was	1
as	1
foolish	1
as	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
more	1
foolish	1
than	1
his	1
daughter	1
jane	1
confessed	1
herself	1
a	1
little	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
match	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
less	1
of	1
her	1
astonishment	1
than	1
of	1
her	1
earnest	1
desire	1
for	1
their	1
happiness	1
nor	1
could	1
elizabeth	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
improbable	1
kitty	1
and	1
lydia	1
were	1
far	1
from	1
envying	1
miss	1
lucas	1
for	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
clergyman	1
and	1
it	1
affected	1
them	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
than	1
as	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
to	1
spread	1
at	1
meryton	1
lady	1
lucas	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
insensible	1
of	1
triumph	1
on	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
retort	1
on	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
daughter	1
well	1
married	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
at	1
longbourn	1
rather	1
oftener	1
than	1
usual	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
happy	1
she	1
was	1
though	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
s	1
sour	1
looks	1
and	1
ill	1
natured	1
remarks	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
enough	1
to	1
drive	1
happiness	1
away	1
between	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
charlotte	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
restraint	1
which	1
kept	1
them	1
mutually	1
silent	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
felt	1
persuaded	1
that	1
no	1
real	1
confidence	1
could	1
ever	1
subsist	1
between	1
them	1
again	1
her	1
disappointment	1
in	1
charlotte	1
made	1
her	1
turn	1
with	1
fonder	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
of	1
whose	1
rectitude	1
and	1
delicacy	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
her	1
opinion	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
shaken	1
and	1
for	1
whose	1
happiness	1
she	1
grew	1
daily	1
more	1
anxious	1
as	1
bingley	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
gone	1
a	1
week	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
was	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
return	1
jane	1
had	1
sent	1
caroline	1
an	1
early	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
letter	1
and	1
was	1
counting	1
the	1
days	1
till	1
she	1
might	1
reasonably	1
hope	1
to	1
hear	1
again	1
the	1
promised	1
letter	1
of	1
thanks	1
from	1
mr	1
collins	1
arrived	1
on	1
tuesday	1
addressed	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
written	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
gratitude	1
which	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
s	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
might	1
have	1
prompted	1
after	1
discharging	1
his	1
conscience	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
inform	1
them	1
with	1
many	1
rapturous	1
expressions	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
in	1
having	1
obtained	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
their	1
amiable	1
neighbour	1
miss	1
lucas	1
and	1
then	1
explained	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
merely	1
with	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
enjoying	1
her	1
society	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
close	1
with	1
their	1
kind	1
wish	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
again	1
at	1
longbourn	1
whither	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
return	1
on	1
monday	1
fortnight	1
for	1
lady	1
catherine	1
he	1
added	1
so	1
heartily	1
approved	1
his	1
marriage	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
which	1
he	1
trusted	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
unanswerable	1
argument	1
with	1
his	1
amiable	1
charlotte	1
to	1
name	1
an	1
early	1
day	1
for	1
making	1
him	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
return	1
into	1
hertfordshire	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
pleasure	1
to	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
disposed	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
strange	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
longbourn	1
instead	1
of	1
to	1
lucas	1
lodge	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
very	1
inconvenient	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
troublesome	1
she	1
hated	1
having	1
visitors	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
while	1
her	1
health	1
was	1
so	1
indifferent	1
and	1
lovers	1
were	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
the	1
most	1
disagreeable	1
such	1
were	1
the	1
gentle	1
murmurs	1
of	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
way	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
distress	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
continued	1
absence	1
neither	1
jane	1
nor	1
elizabeth	1
were	1
comfortable	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
passed	1
away	1
without	1
bringing	1
any	1
other	1
tidings	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
shortly	1
prevailed	1
in	1
meryton	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
netherfield	1
the	1
whole	1
winter	1
a	1
report	1
which	1
highly	1
incensed	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
and	1
which	1
she	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
contradict	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
scandalous	1
falsehood	1
even	1
elizabeth	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
not	1
that	1
bingley	1
was	1
indifferent	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
sisters	1
would	1
be	1
successful	1
in	1
keeping	1
him	1
away	1
unwilling	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
admit	1
an	1
idea	1
so	1
destructive	1
of	1
jane	1
s	1
happiness	1
and	1
so	1
dishonorable	1
to	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
prevent	1
its	1
frequently	1
occurring	1
the	1
united	1
efforts	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
unfeeling	1
sisters	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
overpowering	1
friend	1
assisted	1
by	1
the	1
attractions	1
of	1
miss	1
darcy	1
and	1
the	1
amusements	1
of	1
london	1
might	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
she	1
feared	1
for	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
attachment	1
as	1
for	1
jane	1
her	1
anxiety	1
under	1
this	1
suspense	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
more	1
painful	1
than	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
but	1
whatever	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
was	1
desirous	1
of	1
concealing	1
and	1
between	1
herself	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
therefore	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
never	1
alluded	1
to	1
but	1
as	1
no	1
such	1
delicacy	1
restrained	1
her	1
mother	1
an	1
hour	1
seldom	1
passed	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
bingley	1
express	1
her	1
impatience	1
for	1
his	1
arrival	1
or	1
even	1
require	1
jane	1
to	1
confess	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
she	1
would	1
think	1
herself	1
very	1
ill	1
used	1
it	1
needed	1
all	1
jane	1
s	1
steady	1
mildness	1
to	1
bear	1
these	1
attacks	1
with	1
tolerable	1
tranquillity	1
mr	1
collins	1
returned	1
most	1
punctually	1
on	1
monday	1
fortnight	1
but	1
his	1
reception	1
at	1
longbourn	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
gracious	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
introduction	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
happy	1
however	1
to	1
need	1
much	1
attention	1
and	1
luckily	1
for	1
the	1
others	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
love	1
making	1
relieved	1
them	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
his	1
company	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
every	1
day	1
was	1
spent	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
lucas	1
lodge	1
and	1
he	1
sometimes	1
returned	1
to	1
longbourn	1
only	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
his	1
absence	1
before	1
the	1
family	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
was	1
really	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
pitiable	1
state	1
the	1
very	1
mention	1
of	1
anything	1
concerning	1
the	1
match	1
threw	1
her	1
into	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
ill	1
humour	1
and	1
wherever	1
she	1
went	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
hearing	1
it	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
miss	1
lucas	1
was	1
odious	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
her	1
successor	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
she	1
regarded	1
her	1
with	1
jealous	1
abhorrence	1
whenever	1
charlotte	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
she	1
concluded	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
anticipating	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
possession	1
and	1
whenever	1
she	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
longbourn	1
estate	1
and	1
resolving	1
to	1
turn	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
mr	1
bennet	1
were	1
dead	1
she	1
complained	1
bitterly	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
indeed	1
mr	1
bennet	1
said	1
she	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
charlotte	1
lucas	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
mistress	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
take	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
it	1
my	1
dear	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
such	1
gloomy	1
thoughts	1
let	1
us	1
hope	1
for	1
better	1
things	1
let	1
us	1
flatter	1
ourselves	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
survivor	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
consoling	1
to	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
and	1
therefore	1
instead	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
answer	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
before	1
i	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
all	1
this	1
estate	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
entail	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
mind	1
it	1
what	1
should	1
not	1
you	1
mind	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
mind	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
thankful	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
preserved	1
from	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
such	1
insensibility	1
i	1
never	1
can	1
be	1
thankful	1
mr	1
bennet	1
for	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
entail	1
how	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
conscience	1
to	1
entail	1
away	1
an	1
estate	1
from	1
one	1
s	1
own	1
daughters	1
i	1
cannot	1
understand	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
too	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
have	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
anybody	1
else	1
i	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
yourself	1
to	1

letter	1
arrived	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
sentence	1
conveyed	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
all	1
settled	1
in	1
london	1
for	1
the	1

concluded	1
with	1
her	1

not	1

had	1
time	1
to	1
pay	1

when	1

could	1

to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
found	1
little	1

the	1
professed	1
affection	1
of	1
the	1

on	1

caroline	1
boasted	1
joyfully	1
of	1
their	1
increasing	1
intimacy	1

ventured	1
to	1
predict	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
wishes	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
unfolded	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
letter	1

wrote	1
also	1
with	1
great	1
pleasure	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
being	1
an	1
inmate	1
of	1
mr	1
darcy	1

the	1

all	1

it	1
in	1
silent	1
indignation	1
her	1

for	1
her	1

s	1
assertion	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
being	1
partial	1
to	1

darcy	1
she	1
paid	1
no	1
credit	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
fond	1
of	1
jane	1
she	1
doubted	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1

ever	1
done	1
and	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
disposed	1
to	1
like	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
without	1
anger	1
hardly	1
without	1
contempt	1
on	1
that	1
easiness	1
of	1
temper	1
that	1
want	1
of	1
proper	1
resolution	1
which	1
now	1
made	1
him	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
his	1
designing	1
friends	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
happiness	1
to	1
the	1
caprice	1
of	1
their	1
inclination	1

to	1
sport	1
with	1
it	1
in	1
whatever	1
manner	1
he	1
thought	1
best	1

her	1
sister	1
s	1
was	1
involved	1
in	1
it	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
sensible	1
himself	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
in	1
short	1
on	1
which	1
reflection	1
would	1
be	1
long	1
indulged	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
unavailing	1
she	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
else	1
and	1
yet	1
whether	1
bingley	1
s	1
regard	1
had	1
really	1
died	1
away	1
or	1
were	1
suppressed	1
by	1
his	1
friends	1
interference	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
aware	1
of	1
jane	1

attachment	1

whether	1
it	1
had	1
escaped	1
his	1
observation	1
whatever	1
were	1
the	1
case	1
though	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
must	1
be	1
materially	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
difference	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
situation	1
remained	1
the	1
same	1
her	1
peace	1
equally	1
wounded	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
passed	1
before	1
jane	1
had	1
courage	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
on	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
s	1
leaving	1
them	1
together	1
after	1
a	1
longer	1
irritation	1
than	1
usual	1
about	1
netherfield	1
and	1
its	1
master	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
oh	1
that	1
my	1
dear	1
mother	1
had	1
more	1
command	1
over	1
herself	1
she	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
she	1
gives	1
me	1
by	1
her	1
continual	1
reflections	1
on	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
repine	1
it	1
cannot	1
last	1
long	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
forgot	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
before	1
elizabeth	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
with	1
incredulous	1
solicitude	1
but	1
said	1
nothing	1
you	1
doubt	1
me	1
cried	1
jane	1
slightly	1
colouring	1
indeed	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
he	1
may	1
live	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
amiable	1
man	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
either	1
to	1
hope	1
or	1
fear	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
reproach	1
him	1
with	1
thank	1
god	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
that	1
pain	1
a	1
little	1
time	1
therefore	1
i	1
shall	1
certainly	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
better	1
with	1
a	1
stronger	1
voice	1
she	1
soon	1
added	1
i	1
have	1
this	1
comfort	1
immediately	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
error	1
of	1
fancy	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
but	1
myself	1
my	1
dear	1
jane	1
exclaimed	1
elizabeth	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
good	1
your	1
sweetness	1
and	1

as	1
you	1
deserve	1
miss	1

eagerly	1
disclaimed	1
all	1
extraordinary	1
merit	1
and	1
threw	1
back	1
the	1
praise	1
on	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
warm	1
affection	1
nay	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
fair	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
think	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
respectable	1
and	1
are	1
hurt	1
if	1
i	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
anybody	1
i	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
you	1
perfect	1
and	1
you	1
set	1
yourself	1
against	1
it	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
my	1
running	1
into	1
any	1
excess	1
of	1
my	1
encroaching	1
on	1
your	1

of	1
universal	1
good	1
will	1

not	1
there	1
are	1
few	1
people	1
whom	1
i	1
really	1
love	1
and	1
still	1
fewer	1
of	1
whom	1
i	1
think	1
well	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
see	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
more	1
am	1
i	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
confirms	1
my	1
belief	1
of	1
the	1
inconsistency	1
of	1
all	1
human	1
characters	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
dependence	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
merit	1
or	1
sense	1
i	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
two	1
instances	1
lately	1
one	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
mention	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
charlotte	1
s	1
marriage	1
it	1
is	1
unaccountable	1
in	1
every	1
view	1
it	1
is	1
unaccountable	1
my	1
dear	1
lizzy	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
such	1
feelings	1
as	1
these	1
they	1
will	1
ruin	1
your	1
happiness	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
allowance	1
enough	1
for	1
difference	1
of	1
situation	1
and	1
temper	1
consider	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
respectability	1
and	1
charlotte	1
s	1
steady	1
prudent	1
character	1
remember	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
family	1
that	1
as	1
to	1
fortune	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
eligible	1
match	1
and	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
for	1
everybody	1
s	1
sake	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
feel	1
something	1
like	1
regard	1
and	1
esteem	1
for	1
our	1
cousin	1
to	1
oblige	1
you	1
i	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
believe	1
almost	1
anything	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
could	1
be	1
benefited	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
belief	1
as	1
this	1
for	1
were	1
i	1
persuaded	1
that	1
charlotte	1
had	1
any	1
regard	1
for	1
him	1
i	1
should	1
only	1
think	1
worse	1
of	1
her	1
understanding	1
than	1
i	1
now	1
do	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
my	1
dear	1
jane	1
mr	1
collins	1
is	1
a	1
conceited	1
pompous	1
narrow	1
minded	1
silly	1
man	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
feel	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
married	1
him	1
cannot	1
have	1
a	1
proper	1
way	1
of	1
thinking	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
defend	1
her	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
charlotte	1
lucas	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
one	1
individual	1
change	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
principle	1
and	1
integrity	1
nor	1
endeavour	1
to	1
persuade	1
yourself	1
or	1
me	1
that	1
selfishness	1
is	1
prudence	1
and	1
insensibility	1
of	1
danger	1
security	1
for	1
happiness	1
i	1
must	1
think	1
your	1
language	1
too	1
strong	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
both	1
replied	1
jane	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
convinced	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
seeing	1
them	1
happy	1
together	1
but	1
enough	1
of	1
this	1
you	1
alluded	1
to	1
something	1
else	1
you	1
mentioned	1
two	1
instances	1
i	1
cannot	1
misunderstand	1
you	1
but	1
i	1
entreat	1
you	1
dear	1
lizzy	1
not	1
to	1
pain	1
me	1
by	1
thinking	1
that	1
person	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
saying	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
sunk	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
fancy	1
ourselves	1
intentionally	1
injured	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
a	1
lively	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
so	1
guarded	1
and	1
circumspect	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
often	1
nothing	1
but	1
our	1
own	1
vanity	1
that	1
deceives	1
us	1
women	1
fancy	1
admiration	1
means	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
does	1
and	1
men	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
designedly	1
done	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
justified	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
there	1
being	1
so	1
much	1
design	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
some	1
persons	1
imagine	1
i	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
attributing	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
conduct	1
to	1
design	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
but	1
without	1
scheming	1
to	1
do	1
wrong	1
or	1
to	1
make	1
others	1
unhappy	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
error	1
and	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
misery	1
thoughtlessness	1
want	1
of	1
attention	1
to	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
feelings	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
resolution	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
business	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
impute	1
it	1
to	1
either	1
of	1
those	1
yes	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
but	1
if	1
i	1
go	1
on	1
i	1
shall	1
displease	1
you	1
by	1
saying	1
what	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
persons	1
you	1
esteem	1
stop	1
me	1
whilst	1
you	1
can	1
you	1
persist	1
then	1
in	1
supposing	1
his	1
sisters	1
influence	1
him	1
yes	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
i	1
cannot	1
believe	1
it	1
why	1
should	1
they	1
try	1
to	1
influence	1
him	1
they	1
can	1
only	1
wish	1
his	1
happiness	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
attached	1
to	1
me	1
no	1
other	1
woman	1
can	1
secure	1
it	1
your	1
first	1
position	1
is	1
false	1
they	1
may	1
wish	1
many	1
things	1
besides	1
his	1
happiness	1
they	1
may	1
wish	1
his	1
increase	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
consequence	1
they	1
may	1
wish	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
money	1
great	1
connections	1
and	1
pride	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
they	1
do	1
wish	1
him	1
to	1
choose	1
miss	1
darcy	1
replied	1
jane	1
but	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
from	1
better	1
feelings	1
than	1
you	1
are	1
supposing	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
her	1
much	1
longer	1
than	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
me	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
they	1
love	1
her	1
better	1
but	1
whatever	1
may	1
be	1
their	1
own	1
wishes	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
unlikely	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
opposed	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
what	1
sister	1
would	1
think	1
herself	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
unless	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
very	1
objectionable	1
if	1
they	1
believed	1
him	1
attached	1
to	1
me	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
part	1
us	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
so	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
succeed	1
by	1
supposing	1
such	1
an	1
affection	1
you	1
make	1
everybody	1
acting	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
wrong	1
and	1
me	1
most	1
unhappy	1
do	1
not	1
distress	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
mistaken	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
is	1
light	1
it	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
what	1
i	1
should	1
feel	1
in	1
thinking	1
ill	1
of	1
him	1
or	1
his	1
sisters	1
let	1
me	1
take	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
understood	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
oppose	1
such	1
a	1
wish	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
name	1
was	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
mentioned	1
between	1
them	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
wonder	1
and	1
repine	1
at	1
his	1
returning	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
though	1
a	1
day	1
seldom	1
passed	1
in	1
which	1
elizabeth	1
did	1
not	1
account	1
for	1
it	1
clearly	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
chance	1
of	1
her	1
ever	1
considering	1
it	1
with	1
less	1
perplexity	1
her	1
daughter	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
convince	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
herself	1
that	1
his	1
attentions	1
to	1
jane	1
had	1
been	1
merely	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
and	1
transient	1
liking	1
which	1
ceased	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
no	1
more	1
but	1
though	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
the	1
statement	1
was	1
admitted	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
story	1
to	1
repeat	1
every	1
day	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
s	1
best	1
comfort	1
was	1
that	1
mr	1
bingley	1
must	1
be	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
mr	1
bennet	1
treated	1
the	1
matter	1
differently	1
so	1
lizzy	1
said	1
he	1
one	1
day	1
your	1
sister	1
is	1
crossed	1
in	1
love	1
i	1
find	1
i	1
congratulate	1
her	1
next	1
to	1
being	1
married	1
a	1
girl	1
likes	1
to	1
be	1
crossed	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
love	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
and	1
it	1
gives	1
her	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
distinction	1
among	1
her	1
companions	1
when	1
is	1
your	1
turn	1
to	1
come	1
you	1
will	1
hardly	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
long	1
outdone	1
by	1
jane	1
now	1
is	1
your	1
time	1
here	1
are	1
officers	1
enough	1
in	1
meryton	1
to	1
disappoint	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
let	1
wickham	1
be	1
your	1
man	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
pleasant	1
fellow	1
and	1
would	1
jilt	1
you	1
creditably	1
thank	1
you	1
sir	1
but	1
a	1
less	1
agreeable	1
man	1
would	1
satisfy	1
me	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
all	1
expect	1
jane	1
s	1
good	1
fortune	1
true	1
said	1
mr	1
bennet	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
whatever	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
may	1
befall	1
you	1
you	1
have	1
an	1
affectionate	1
mother	1
who	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
it	1
mr	1
wickham	1
s	1
society	1
was	1
of	1
material	1
service	1
in	1
dispelling	1
the	1
gloom	1
which	1
the	1
late	1
perverse	1
occurrences	1
had	1
thrown	1
on	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
longbourn	1
family	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
often	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
other	1
recommendations	1
was	1
now	1
added	1
that	1
of	1
general	1
unreserve	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
what	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
his	1
claims	1
on	1
mr	1
darcy	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
him	1
was	1
now	1
openly	1
acknowledged	1
and	1
publicly	1
canvassed	1
and	1
everybody	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
had	1
always	1
disliked	1
mr	1
darcy	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
miss	1
bennet	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
creature	1
who	1
could	1
suppose	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
any	1
extenuating	1
circumstances	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
hertfordshire	1
her	1
mild	1
and	1
steady	1
candour	1
always	1
pleaded	1
for	1
allowances	1
and	1
urged	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
mistakes	1
but	1
by	1
everybody	1
else	1
mr	1
darcy	1
was	1
condemned	1
as	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
men	1
chapter	1

after	1
a	1
week	1
spent	1
in	1
professions	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
schemes	1
of	1
felicity	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
called	1
from	1
his	1
amiable	1
charlotte	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
saturday	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
separation	1
however	1
might	1
be	1
alleviated	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
by	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
his	1
bride	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
shortly	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
into	1
hertfordshire	1
the	1
day	1
would	1
be	1
fixed	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
at	1
longbourn	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
solemnity	1
as	1
before	1
wished	1
his	1
fair	1
cousins	1
health	1
and	1
happiness	1
again	1
and	1
promised	1
their	1
father	1
another	1
letter	1
of	1
thanks	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
monday	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
receiving	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
came	1
as	1
usual	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
christmas	1
at	1
longbourn	1
mr	1
gardiner	1
was	1
a	1
sensible	1
gentlemanlike	1
man	1
greatly	1
superior	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
nature	1
as	1
education	1
the	1
netherfield	1
ladies	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
difficulty	1
in	1
believing	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
lived	1
by	1
trade	1
and	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
warehouses	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
well	1
bred	1
and	1
agreeable	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
who	1
was	1
several	1
years	1
younger	1
than	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
and	1
mrs	1
phillips	1
was	1
an	1
amiable	1
intelligent	1
elegant	1
woman	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
favourite	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
longbourn	1
nieces	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
eldest	1
and	1
herself	1
especially	1
there	1
subsisted	1
a	1
particular	1
regard	1
they	1
had	1
frequently	1
been	1
staying	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
town	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
s	1
business	1
on	1
her	1
arrival	1
was	1
to	1
distribute	1
her	1
presents	1
and	1
describe	1
the	1
newest	1
fashions	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
she	1

active	1
part	1
to	1
play	1
it	1
became	1
her	1
turn	1
to	1
listen	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
had	1
many	1
grievances	1
to	1
relate	1
and	1
much	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
very	1
ill	1
used	1
since	1
she	1
last	1
saw	1
her	1
sister	1
two	1
of	1
her	1
girls	1
had	1
been	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
marriage	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
blame	1
jane	1
she	1
continued	1
for	1
jane	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
mr	1
bingley	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
but	1
lizzy	1
oh	1
sister	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
wife	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
perverseness	1
he	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
in	1
this	1
very	1
room	1
and	1
she	1
refused	1
him	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
lady	1
lucas	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
daughter	1
married	1
before	1
i	1
have	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
longbourn	1
estate	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
entailed	1
as	1
ever	1
the	1
lucases	1
are	1
very	1
artful	1
people	1
indeed	1
sister	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
can	1
get	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
very	1
nervous	1
and	1
poorly	1
to	1
be	1
thwarted	1
so	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
family	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
neighbours	1
who	1
think	1
of	1
themselves	1
before	1
anybody	1
else	1
however	1
your	1
coming	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
comforts	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
you	1
tell	1
us	1
of	1
long	1
sleeves	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
this	1
news	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
jane	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
correspondence	1
with	1
her	1
made	1
her	1
sister	1
a	1
slight	1
answer	1
and	1
in	1
compassion	1
to	1
her	1
nieces	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation	1
when	1
alone	1
with	1
elizabeth	1
afterwards	1
she	1
spoke	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
it	1
seems	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
desirable	1
match	1
for	1
jane	1
said	1
she	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
it	1
went	1
off	1
but	1
these	1
things	1
happen	1
so	1
often	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
describe	1
mr	1
bingley	1
so	1
easily	1
falls	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
pretty	1
girl	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
and	1
when	1
accident	1
separates	1
them	1
so	1
easily	1
forgets	1
her	1
that	1
these	1
sort	1
of	1
inconsistencies	1
are	1
very	1
frequent	1
an	1
excellent	1
consolation	1
in	1
its	1
way	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
suffer	1
by	1
accident	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
often	1
happen	1
that	1
the	1
interference	1
of	1
friends	1
will	1
persuade	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
independent	1
fortune	1
to	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
violently	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
but	1
that	1
expression	1
of	1
violently	1
in	1
love	1
is	1
so	1
hackneyed	1
so	1
doubtful	1
so	1
indefinite	1
that	1
it	1
gives	1
me	1
very	1
little	1
idea	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
often	1
applied	1
to	1
feelings	1
which	1
arise	1
from	1
a	1
half	1
hour	1
s	1
acquaintance	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
real	1
strong	1
attachment	1
pray	1
how	1
violent	1
was	1
mr	1
bingley	1
s	1
love	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
more	1
promising	1
inclination	1
he	1
was	1
growing	1
quite	1
inattentive	1
to	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
by	1
her	1
every	1
time	1
they	1
met	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
decided	1
and	1
remarkable	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
ball	1
he	1
offended	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
by	1
not	1
asking	1
them	1
to	1
dance	1
and	1
i	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
twice	1
myself	1
without	1
receiving	1
an	1
answer	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
finer	1
symptoms	1
is	1
not	1
general	1
incivility	1
the	1
very	1
essence	1
of	1
love	1
oh	1
yes	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
love	1
which	1
i	1
suppose	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
felt	1
poor	1
jane	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
because	1
with	1
her	1
disposition	1
she	1
may	1
not	1
get	1
over	1
it	1
immediately	1
it	1
had	1
better	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
you	1
lizzy	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
laughed	1
yourself	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
sooner	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
with	1
us	1
change	1
of	1
scene	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
and	1
perhaps	1
a	1
little	1
relief	1
from	1
home	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
useful	1
as	1
anything	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
pleased	1
with	1
this	1
proposal	1
and	1
felt	1
persuaded	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
ready	1
acquiescence	1
i	1
hope	1
added	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
that	1
no	1
consideration	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
will	1
influence	1
her	1
we	1
live	1
in	1
so	1
different	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
town	1
all	1
our	1
connections	1
are	1
so	1
different	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know	1
we	1
go	1
out	1
so	1
little	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
improbable	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
meet	1
at	1
all	1
unless	1
he	1
really	1
comes	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
mr	1
darcy	1
would	1
no	1
more	1
suffer	1
him	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
jane	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
london	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
mr	1
darcy	1
may	1
perhaps	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
gracechurch	1
street	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
hardly	1
think	1
a	1
month	1
s	1
ablution	1
enough	1
to	1
cleanse	1
him	1
from	1
its	1
impurities	1
were	1
he	1
once	1
to	1
enter	1
it	1
and	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
mr	1
bingley	1
never	1
stirs	1
without	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
i	1
hope	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
meet	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
does	1
not	1
jane	1
correspond	1
with	1
his	1
sister	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
help	1
calling	1
she	1
will	1
drop	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
entirely	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
certainty	1
in	1
which	1
elizabeth	1
affected	1
to	1
place	1
this	1
point	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
still	1
more	1
interesting	1
one	1
of	1
bingley	1
s	1
being	1
withheld	1
from	1
seeing	1
jane	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
solicitude	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
which	1
convinced	1
her	1
on	1
examination	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
it	1
entirely	1
hopeless	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
and	1
sometimes	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
his	1
affection	1
might	1
be	1
reanimated	1
and	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
friends	1
successfully	1
combated	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
natural	1
influence	1
of	1
jane	1
s	1
attractions	1
miss	1
bennet	1
accepted	1
her	1
aunt	1
s	1
invitation	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
the	1
bingleys	1
were	1
no	1
otherwise	1
in	1
her	1
thoughts	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
than	1
as	1
she	1
hoped	1
by	1
caroline	1
s	1
not	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
she	1
might	1
occasionally	1
spend	1
a	1
morning	1
with	1
her	1
without	1
any	1
danger	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
the	1
gardiners	1
stayed	1
a	1
week	1
at	1
longbourn	1
and	1
what	1
with	1
the	1
phillipses	1
the	1
lucases	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
day	1
without	1
its	1
engagement	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
had	1
so	1
carefully	1
provided	1
for	1
the	1
entertainment	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
family	1
dinner	1
when	1
the	1
engagement	1
was	1
for	1
home	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
always	1
made	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
of	1
which	1
officers	1
mr	1
wickham	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
occasions	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
rendered	1
suspicious	1
by	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
warm	1
commendation	1
narrowly	1
observed	1
them	1
both	1
without	1
supposing	1
them	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
saw	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
seriously	1
in	1
love	1
their	1
preference	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
was	1
plain	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
uneasy	1
and	1
she	1
resolved	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
before	1
she	1
left	1
hertfordshire	1
and	1
represent	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
encouraging	1
such	1
an	1
attachment	1
to	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
wickham	1
had	1
one	1
means	1
of	1
affording	1
pleasure	1
unconnected	1
with	1
his	1
general	1
powers	1
about	1
ten	1
or	1
a	1
dozen	1
years	1
ago	1
before	1
her	1
marriage	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
part	1
of	1
derbyshire	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
belonged	1
they	1
had	1
therefore	1
many	1
acquaintances	1
in	1
common	1
and	1
though	1
wickham	1
had	1
been	1
little	1
there	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
darcy	1
s	1
father	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
fresher	1
intelligence	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
friends	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
procuring	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
had	1
seen	1
pemberley	1
and	1
known	1
the	1
late	1
mr	1
darcy	1
by	1
character	1
perfectly	1
well	1
here	1
consequently	1
was	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
subject	1
of	1
discourse	1
in	1
comparing	1
her	1
recollection	1
of	1
pemberley	1
with	1
the	1
minute	1
description	1
which	1
wickham	1
could	1
give	1
and	1
in	1
bestowing	1
her	1
tribute	1
of	1
praise	1
on	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
its	1
late	1

herself	1

being	1
made	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
present	1
mr	1
darcy	1

treatment	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
remember	1
some	1
of	1
that	1
gentleman	1
s	1
reputed	1
disposition	1
when	1
quite	1
a	1
lad	1
which	1
might	1
agree	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
confident	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
she	1
recollected	1
having	1
heard	1
mr	1
fitzwilliam	1
darcy	1
formerly	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
proud	1

mrs	1
gardiner	1
s	1
caution	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
punctually	1
and	1
kindly	1
given	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
favourable	1
opportunity	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
alone	1
after	1
honestly	1
telling	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
thus	1
went	1
on	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
sensible	1
a	1
girl	1
lizzy	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
merely	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
warned	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
therefore	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
speaking	1
openly	1
seriously	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
be	1
on	1
your	1
guard	1
do	1
not	1
involve	1
yourself	1
or	1
endeavour	1
to	1
involve	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
affection	1
which	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
fortune	1
would	1
make	1
so	1
very	1
imprudent	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
fortune	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
better	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
let	1
your	1
fancy	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
you	1
you	1
have	1
sense	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
expect	1
you	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
your	1
father	1
would	1
depend	1
on	1
your	1
resolution	1
and	1
good	1
conduct	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
disappoint	1
your	1
father	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt	1
this	1
is	1
being	1
serious	1
indeed	1
yes	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
to	1
engage	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
serious	1
likewise	1
well	1
then	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
under	1
any	1
alarm	1
i	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
of	1
mr	1
wickham	1
too	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
can	1
prevent	1
it	1
elizabeth	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
serious	1
now	1
i	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
i	1
will	1
try	1
again	1
at	1
present	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
mr	1
wickham	1
no	1
i	1
certainly	1
am	1
not	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
beyond	1
all	1
comparison	1
the	1
most	1
agreeable	1
man	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
becomes	1
really	1
attached	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
i	1
see	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
it	1
oh	1
that	1
abominable	1
mr	1
darcy	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
opinion	1
of	1
me	1
does	1
me	1
the	1
greatest	1
honour	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
miserable	1
to	1
forfeit	1
it	1
my	1
father	1
however	1
is	1
partial	1
to	1
mr	1
wickham	1
in	1
short	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
unhappy	1
but	1
since	1
we	1
see	1
every	1
day	1
that	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
affection	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
seldom	1
withheld	1
by	1
immediate	1
want	1
of	1
fortune	1
from	1
entering	1
into	1
engagements	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
promise	1
to	1
be	1
wiser	1
than	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
if	1
i	1
am	1
tempted	1
or	1
how	1
am	1
i	1
even	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wisdom	1
to	1
resist	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
promise	1
you	1
therefore	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
believe	1
myself	1
his	1
first	1
object	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
wishing	1
in	1
short	1
i	1
will	1
do	1
my	1
best	1
perhaps	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
if	1
you	1
discourage	1
his	1
coming	1
here	1
so	1
very	1
often	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
remind	1
your	1
mother	1
of	1
inviting	1
him	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
with	1
a	1
conscious	1
smile	1
very	1
true	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
that	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
here	1
so	1
often	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
frequently	1
invited	1
this	1
week	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
mother	1
s	1
ideas	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
constant	1
company	1
for	1
her	1
friends	1
but	1
really	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
honour	1
i	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
i	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wisest	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
are	1
satisfied	1
her	1
aunt	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
having	1
thanked	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
her	1
hints	1
they	1
parted	1
a	1
wonderful	1
instance	1
of	1
advice	1
being	1
given	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
without	1
being	1
resented	1
mr	1
collins	1
returned	1
into	1
hertfordshire	1
soon	1
after	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
quitted	1
by	1
the	1
gardiners	1
and	1
jane	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
abode	1
with	1
the	1
lucases	1
his	1
arrival	1
was	1
no	1
great	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
mrs	1
bennet	1
his	1
marriage	1
was	1
now	1
fast	1
approaching	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
length	1
so	1
far	1
resigned	1
as	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
inevitable	1
and	1
even	1
repeatedly	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
an	1
ill	1
natured	1
tone	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
happy	1
thursday	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wedding	1
day	1
and	1
on	1
wednesday	1
miss	1
lucas	1
paid	1
her	1
farewell	1
visit	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
rose	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
elizabeth	1
ashamed	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
ungracious	1
and	1
reluctant	1
good	1
wishes	1
and	1
sincerely	1
affected	1
herself	1
accompanied	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
downstairs	1
together	1
charlotte	1
said	1
i	1
shall	1
depend	1
on	1
hearing	1
from	1
you	1
very	1
often	1
eliza	1
that	1
you	1
certainly	1
shall	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
another	1
favour	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
will	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
me	1
we	1
shall	1
often	1
meet	1
i	1
hope	1
in	1
hertfordshire	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
leave	1
kent	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
promise	1
me	1
therefore	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
hunsford	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
though	1
she	1
foresaw	1
little	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
visit	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
maria	1
are	1
coming	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
march	1
added	1
charlotte	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
consent	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
indeed	1
eliza	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
welcome	1
as	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
wedding	1
took	1
place	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
kent	1
from	1
the	1
church	1
door	1
and	1
everybody	1
had	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
to	1
hear	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
as	1
usual	1
elizabeth	1
soon	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
friend	1
and	1
their	1
correspondence	1
was	1
as	1
regular	1
and	1
frequent	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
equally	1
unreserved	1
was	1
impossible	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
never	1
address	1
her	1
without	1
feeling	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
intimacy	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
though	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
slacken	1
as	1
a	1
correspondent	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
rather	1
than	1
what	1
was	1
charlotte	1
s	1
first	1
letters	1
were	1
received	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
eagerness	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
new	1
home	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
like	1
lady	1
catherine	1
and	1
how	1
happy	1
she	1
would	1
dare	1
pronounce	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
though	1
when	1
the	1
letters	1
were	1
read	1
elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
charlotte	1
expressed	1
herself	1
on	1
every	1
point	1
exactly	1
as	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
foreseen	1
she	1
wrote	1
cheerfully	1
seemed	1
surrounded	1
with	1
comforts	1
and	1
mentioned	1
nothing	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
praise	1
the	1
house	1
furniture	1
neighbourhood	1
and	1
roads	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
her	1
taste	1
and	1
lady	1
catherine	1
s	1
behaviour	1
was	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
obliging	1
it	1
was	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
picture	1
of	1
hunsford	1
and	1
rosings	1
rationally	1
softened	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
perceived	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
visit	1
there	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
rest	1
jane	1
had	1
already	1
written	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
to	1
announce	1
their	1
safe	1
arrival	1
in	1
london	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
wrote	1
again	1
elizabeth	1
hoped	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
bingleys	1
her	1
impatience	1
for	1
this	1
second	1
letter	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
rewarded	1
as	1
impatience	1
generally	1
is	1
jane	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
week	1
in	1
town	1
without	1
either	1
seeing	1
or	1
hearing	1
from	1
caroline	1
she	1
accounted	1
for	1
it	1
however	1
by	1
supposing	1
that	1
her	1
last	1
letter	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
from	1
longbourn	1
had	1
by	1
some	1
accident	1
been	1
lost	1
my	1
aunt	1
she	1
continued	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
morrow	1
into	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
calling	1
in	1
grosvenor	1
street	1
she	1
wrote	1
again	1
when	1
the	1
visit	1
was	1
paid	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
miss	1
bingley	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
caroline	1
in	1
spirits	1
were	1
her	1
words	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
reproached	1
me	1
for	1
giving	1
her	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
my	1
coming	1
to	1
london	1
i	1
was	1
right	1
therefore	1
my	1
last	1
letter	1
had	1
never	1
reached	1
her	1
i	1
inquired	1
after	1
their	1
brother	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
but	1
so	1
much	1
engaged	1
with	1
mr	1
darcy	1
that	1
they	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
saw	1
him	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
miss	1
darcy	1
was	1
expected	1
to	1
dinner	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
my	1
visit	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
as	1
caroline	1
and	1
mrs	1
hurst	1
were	1
going	1
out	1
i	1
dare	1
say	1
i	1
shall	1
see	1
them	1
soon	1
here	1
elizabeth	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
over	1
this	1
letter	1
it	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
accident	1
only	1
could	1
discover	1
to	1
mr	1
bingley	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
being	1
in	1
town	1
four	1
weeks	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
jane	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
regret	1
it	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
blind	1
to	1
miss	1
bingley	1
s	1
inattention	1
after	1
waiting	1
at	1
home	1
every	1
morning	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
and	1
inventing	1
every	1
evening	1
a	1
fresh	1
excuse	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
visitor	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
appear	1
but	1
the	1
shortness	1
of	1
her	1
stay	1
and	1
yet	1
more	1
the	1
alteration	1
of	1
her	1
manner	1
would	1
allow	1
jane	1
to	1
deceive	1
herself	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
letter	1
which	1
she	1
wrote	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
will	1
prove	1
what	1
she	1
felt	1
my	1
dearest	1
lizzy	1
will	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
be	1
incapable	1
of	1
triumphing	1
in	1
her	1
better	1
judgement	1
at	1
my	1
expense	1
when	1
i	1
confess	1
myself	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
entirely	1
deceived	1
in	1
miss	1
bingley	1
s	1
regard	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
though	1
the	1
event	1
has	1
proved	1
you	1
right	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
me	1
obstinate	1
if	1
i	1
still	1
assert	1
that	1
considering	1
what	1
her	1
behaviour	1
was	1
my	1
confidence	1
was	1
as	1
natural	1
as	1
your	1
suspicion	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
comprehend	1
her	1
reason	1
for	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
intimate	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
same	1
circumstances	1
were	1
to	1
happen	1
again	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
deceived	1
again	1
caroline	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
my	1
visit	1
till	1
yesterday	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
note	1
not	1
a	1
line	1
did	1
i	1
receive	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
come	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
it	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
slight	1
formal	1
apology	1
for	1
not	1
calling	1
before	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
wishing	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
again	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
so	1
altered	1
a	1
creature	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
away	1
i	1
was	1
perfectly	1
resolved	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
no	1
longer	1
i	1
pity	1
though	1
i	1
cannot	1
help	1
blaming	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
wrong	1
in	1
singling	1
me	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
i	1
can	1
safely	1
say	1
that	1
every	1
advance	1
to	1
intimacy	1
began	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
but	1
i	1
pity	1
her	1
because	1
she	1
must	1
feel	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
acting	1
wrong	1
and	1
because	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
anxiety	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
need	1
not	1
explain	1
myself	1
farther	1
and	1
though	1
we	1
know	1
this	1
anxiety	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
needless	1
yet	1
if	1
she	1
feels	1
it	1
it	1
will	1
easily	1
account	1
for	1
her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
so	1
deservedly	1
dear	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
whatever	1
anxiety	1
she	1
must	1
feel	1
on	1
his	1
behalf	1
is	1
natural	1
and	1
amiable	1
i	1
cannot	1
but	1
wonder	1
however	1
at	1
her	1
having	1
any	1
such	1
fears	1
now	1
because	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
all	1
cared	1
about	1
me	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
met	1
long	1
ago	1
he	1
knows	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
in	1
town	1
i	1
am	1
certain	1
from	1
something	1
she	1
said	1
herself	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
by	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
talking	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
partial	1
to	1
miss	1
darcy	1
i	1
cannot	1
understand	1
it	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
judging	1
harshly	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
almost	1
tempted	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
appearance	1
of	1
duplicity	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
endeavour	1
to	1
banish	1
every	1
painful	1
thought	1
and	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
what	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
happy	1
your	1
affection	1
and	1
the	1
invariable	1
kindness	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
from	1
you	1
very	1
soon	1
miss	1
bingley	1
said	1
something	1
of	1
his	1
never	1
returning	1
to	1
netherfield	1
again	1
of	1
giving	1
up	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
any	1
certainty	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
mention	1
it	1
i	1
am	1
extremely	1
glad	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
such	1
pleasant	1
accounts	1
from	1
our	1
friends	1
at	1
hunsford	1
pray	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
with	1
sir	1
william	1
and	1
maria	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
comfortable	1
there	1
yours	1
etc	1
this	1
letter	1
gave	1
elizabeth	1
some	1
pain	1
but	1
her	1
spirits	1
returned	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
that	1
jane	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
duped	1
by	1
the	1
sister	1
at	1
least	1
all	1
expectation	1
from	1
the	1
brother	1
was	1
now	1
absolutely	1
over	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
for	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
his	1
attentions	1
his	1
character	1
sunk	1
on	1
every	1
review	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
punishment	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
possible	1
advantage	1
to	1
jane	1
she	1
seriously	1
hoped	1
he	1
might	1
really	1
soon	1
marry	1
mr	1
darcy	1
s	1
sister	1
as	1
by	1
wickham	1
s	1
account	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
abundantly	1
regret	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
away	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
reminded	1
elizabeth	1
of	1
her	1
promise	1
concerning	1
that	1
gentleman	1
and	1
required	1
information	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
such	1
to	1
send	1
as	1
might	1
rather	1
give	1

of	1
ten	1

of	1
the	1
young	1

was	1
now	1
rendering	1
himself	1
agreeable	1

elizabeth	1
less	1
clear	1

perhaps	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
than	1
in	1
charlotte	1

did	1
not	1

with	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
wish	1
of	1

to	1

it	1
a	1

measure	1
for	1
both	1
and	1
could	1
very	1
sincerely	1
wish	1
him	1
happy	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
acknowledged	1
to	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
and	1
after	1
relating	1
the	1
circumstances	1
she	1
thus	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
convinced	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
for	1
had	1
i	1
really	1
experienced	1
that	1
pure	1
and	1
elevating	1
passion	1
i	1
should	1
at	1
present	1
detest	1
his	1
very	1
name	1
and	1
wish	1
him	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
evil	1
but	1
my	1
feelings	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
cordial	1
towards	1
him	1
they	1
are	1
even	1
impartial	1
towards	1
miss	1
king	1
i	1
cannot	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
i	1
hate	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
or	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
unwilling	1
to	1
think	1
her	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
love	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
my	1
watchfulness	1
has	1
been	1
effectual	1
and	1
though	1
i	1
certainly	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
more	1
interesting	1
object	1

all	1
my	1
acquaintances	1

i	1
distractedly	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
i	1
regret	1
my	1

sometimes	1

purchased	1
too	1
dearly	1

at	1

in	1

drew	1

in	1
leaving	1
her	1

who	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
so	1
little	1
liked	1
her	1
going	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him	1

almost	1

side	1

pursuit	1
could	1
not	1

him	1
forget	1
that	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
excite	1
and	1
to	1
deserve	1
his	1
attention	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
to	1
pity	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
be	1
admired	1

in	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
bidding	1
her	1
adieu	1
wishing	1
her	1
every	1
enjoyment	1

her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1

there	1

a	1
solicitude	1

interest	1
which	1
she	1
felt	1
must	1
ever	1
attach	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
sincere	1
regard	1
and	1
she	1
parted	1
from	1
him	1
convinced	1
that	1
whether	1
married	1
or	1
single	1
he	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
her	1
model	1
of	1
the	1

his	1
daughter	1
maria	1

as	1
empty	1
headed	1
as	1
himself	1

nothing	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
worth	1
hearing	1
and	1
were	1
listened	1
to	1
with	1
about	1
as	1
much	1
delight	1
as	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
chaise	1
elizabeth	1
loved	1
absurdities	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
sir	1
william	1
s	1
too	1
long	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
her	1
nothing	1
new	1
of	1
the	1
wonders	1
of	1
his	1
presentation	1
and	1
knighthood	1
and	1
his	1
civilities	1
were	1
worn	1
out	1
like	1
his	1
information	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
journey	1
of	1
only	1
twenty	1
four	1
miles	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
it	1
so	1
early	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
gracechurch	1
street	1
by	1
noon	1
as	1
they	1
drove	1
to	1
mr	1
gardiner	1
s	1
door	1
jane	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
drawing	1
room	1
window	1
watching	1
their	1
arrival	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
passage	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
welcome	1
them	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
looking	1
earnestly	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
healthful	1
and	1
lovely	1
as	1
ever	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
were	1
a	1
troop	1
of	1
little	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
whose	1
eagerness	1
for	1
their	1
cousin	1
s	1
appearance	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
them	1
to	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
whose	1
shyness	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
prevented	1
their	1
coming	1
lower	1
all	1
was	1
joy	1
and	1
kindness	1
the	1
day	1
passed	1
most	1
pleasantly	1
away	1
the	1
morning	1
in	1
bustle	1
and	1
shopping	1
and	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
theatres	1
elizabeth	1
then	1
contrived	1
to	1
sit	1
by	1
her	1
aunt	1
their	1
first	1
object	1
was	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
grieved	1
than	1
astonished	1
to	1
hear	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
her	1
minute	1
inquiries	1
that	1
though	1
jane	1
always	1
struggled	1
to	1
support	1
her	1
spirits	1
there	1
were	1
periods	1
of	1
dejection	1
it	1
was	1
reasonable	1
however	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
continue	1
long	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
particulars	1
also	1
of	1
miss	1
bingley	1
s	1
visit	1
in	1
gracechurch	1
street	1
and	1
repeated	1
conversations	1
occurring	1
at	1
different	1
times	1
between	1
jane	1
and	1
herself	1
which	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
had	1
from	1
her	1
heart	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
then	1
rallied	1
her	1
niece	1
on	1
wickham	1
s	1
desertion	1
and	1
complimented	1
her	1
on	1
bearing	1
it	1
so	1
well	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
elizabeth	1
she	1
added	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
is	1
miss	1
king	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
think	1
our	1
friend	1
mercenary	1
pray	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
matrimonial	1
affairs	1
between	1
the	1
mercenary	1
and	1
the	1
prudent	1
motive	1
where	1
does	1
discretion	1
end	1
and	1
avarice	1
begin	1
last	1
christmas	1
you	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
his	1
marrying	1
me	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
imprudent	1
and	1
now	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
girl	1
with	1
only	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
mercenary	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
miss	1
king	1
is	1
i	1
shall	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
kind	1
of	1
girl	1
i	1
believe	1
i	1
know	1
no	1
harm	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
paid	1
her	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
attention	1
till	1
her	1
grandfather	1
s	1
death	1
made	1
her	1
mistress	1
of	1
this	1
fortune	1
no	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
allowable	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
gain	1
my	1
affections	1
because	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
money	1
what	1
occasion	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
for	1
making	1
love	1
to	1
a	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
equally	1
poor	1
but	1
there	1
seems	1
an	1
indelicacy	1
in	1
directing	1
his	1
attentions	1
towards	1
her	1
so	1
soon	1
after	1
this	1
event	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
distressed	1
circumstances	1
has	1
not	1
time	1
for	1
all	1
those	1
elegant	1
decorums	1
which	1
other	1
people	1
may	1
observe	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
it	1
why	1
should	1
we	1
her	1
not	1
objecting	1
does	1
not	1
justify	1
him	1
it	1
only	1
shows	1
her	1
being	1
deficient	1
in	1
something	1
herself	1
sense	1
or	1
feeling	1
well	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
have	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
choose	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
mercenary	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
foolish	1
no	1
lizzy	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
choose	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
lived	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
derbyshire	1
oh	1
if	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
opinion	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
derbyshire	1
and	1
their	1
intimate	1
friends	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
hertfordshire	1
are	1
not	1
much	1
better	1
i	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
thank	1
heaven	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
morrow	1
where	1
i	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
one	1
agreeable	1
quality	1
who	1
has	1
neither	1
manner	1
nor	1
sense	1
to	1
recommend	1
him	1
stupid	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
ones	1
worth	1
knowing	1
after	1
all	1
take	1
care	1
lizzy	1
that	1
speech	1
savours	1
strongly	1
of	1
disappointment	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
separated	1
by	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
play	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
unexpected	1
happiness	1
of	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
accompany	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
in	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1
pleasure	1
which	1
they	1
proposed	1
taking	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
determined	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
shall	1
carry	1
us	1
said	1
mrs	1
gardiner	1
but	1
perhaps	1
to	1
the	1
lakes	1
no	1
scheme	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
agreeable	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
her	1
acceptance	1
of	1
the	1
invitation	1
was	1
most	1
ready	1
and	1
grateful	1
oh	1
my	1
dear	1
dear	1
aunt	1
she	1
rapturously	1
cried	1
what	1
delight	1
what	1
felicity	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
fresh	1
life	1
and	1
vigour	1
adieu	1
to	1
disappointment	1
and	1
spleen	1
what	1
are	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
rocks	1
and	1
mountains	1
oh	1
what	1
hours	1
of	1
transport	1
we	1
shall	1
spend	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
do	1
return	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
like	1
other	1
travellers	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
one	1
accurate	1
idea	1
of	1
anything	1
we	1
will	1
know	1
where	1
we	1
have	1
gone	1
we	1
will	1
recollect	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
lakes	1
mountains	1
and	1
rivers	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
jumbled	1
together	1
in	1
our	1
imaginations	1
nor	1
when	1
we	1
attempt	1
to	1
describe	1
any	1
particular	1
scene	1
will	1
we	1
begin	1
quarreling	1
about	1
its	1
relative	1
situation	1
let	1
our	1
first	1
effusions	1
be	1
less	1
insupportable	1
than	1

every	1
object	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
s	1
journey	1
was	1
new	1
and	1
interesting	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
sister	1
looking	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
banish	1
all	1
fear	1
for	1
her	1
health	1
and	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
her	1
northern	1
tour	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
source	1
of	1
delight	1
when	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
lane	1
to	1
hunsford	1
every	1
eye	1
was	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
parsonage	1
and	1
every	1
turning	1
expected	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
in	1
view	1
the	1
palings	1
of	1
rosings	1
park	1
was	1
their	1
boundary	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
elizabeth	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
parsonage	1
was	1
discernible	1
the	1
garden	1
sloping	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
house	1
standing	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
green	1
pales	1
and	1
the	1
laurel	1
hedge	1
everything	1
declared	1
they	1
were	1
arriving	1
mr	1
collins	1
and	1
charlotte	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
small	1
gate	1
which	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
short	1
gravel	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
amidst	1
the	1
nods	1
and	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chaise	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
mrs	1
collins	1
welcomed	1
her	1
friend	1
with	1
the	1
liveliest	1
pleasure	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
satisfied	1
with	1
coming	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
so	1
affectionately	1
received	1
she	1
saw	1
instantly	1
that	1
her	1
cousin	1
s	1
manners	1
were	1
not	1
altered	1
by	1
his	1
marriage	1
his	1
formal	1
civility	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
he	1
detained	1
her	1
some	1
minutes	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
satisfy	1
his	1
inquiries	1
after	1
all	1
her	1
family	1
they	1
were	1
then	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
delay	1
than	1
his	1
pointing	1
out	1
the	1
neatness	1
of	1
the	1
entrance	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
parlour	1
he	1
welcomed	1
them	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
with	1
ostentatious	1
formality	1
to	1
his	1
humble	1
abode	1
and	1
punctually	1
repeated	1
all	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
offers	1
of	1
refreshment	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
glory	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
in	1
fancying	1
that	1
in	1
displaying	1
the	1
good	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
its	1
aspect	1
and	1
its	1
furniture	1
he	1
addressed	1
himself	1
particularly	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
feel	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
in	1
refusing	1
him	1
but	1
though	1
everything	1
seemed	1
neat	1
and	1
comfortable	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
gratify	1
him	1
by	1
any	1
sigh	1
of	1
repentance	1
and	1
rather	1
looked	1
with	1
wonder	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
so	1
cheerful	1
an	1
air	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
companion	1
when	1
mr	1
collins	1
said	1
anything	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
might	1
reasonably	1
be	1
ashamed	1
which	1
certainly	1
was	1
not	1
unseldom	1
she	1
involuntarily	1
turned	1
her	1
eye	1
on	1
charlotte	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
she	1
could	1
discern	1
a	1
faint	1
blush	1
but	1
in	1
general	1
charlotte	1
wisely	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
after	1
sitting	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
admire	1
every	1
article	1
of	1
furniture	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
the	1
sideboard	1
to	1
the	1
fender	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
journey	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
london	1
mr	1
collins	1
invited	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
stroll	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
which	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
well	1
laid	1
out	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
cultivation	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
attended	1
himself	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
this	1
garden	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
most	1
respectable	1
pleasures	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
admired	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
countenance	1
with	1
which	1
charlotte	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
healthfulness	1
of	1
the	1
exercise	1
and	1
owned	1
she	1
encouraged	1
it	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
here	1
leading	1
the	1
way	1
through	1
every	1
walk	1
and	1
cross	1
walk	1
and	1
scarcely	1
allowing	1
them	1
an	1
interval	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
praises	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
every	1
view	1
was	1
pointed	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
minuteness	1
which	1
left	1
beauty	1
entirely	1
behind	1
he	1
could	1
number	1
the	1
fields	1
in	1
every	1
direction	1
and	1
could	1
tell	1
how	1
many	1
trees	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
distant	1
clump	1
but	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
views	1
which	1
his	1
garden	1
or	1
which	1
the	1
country	1
or	1
kingdom	1
could	1
boast	1
none	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
rosings	1
afforded	1
by	1
an	1
opening	1
in	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
bordered	1
the	1
park	1
nearly	1
opposite	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
handsome	1
modern	1
building	1
well	1
situated	1
on	1
rising	1
ground	1
from	1
his	1
garden	1
mr	1
collins	1
would	1
have	1
led	1
them	1
round	1
his	1
two	1
meadows	1
but	1
the	1
ladies	1
not	1
having	1
shoes	1
to	1
encounter	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
frost	1
turned	1
back	1
and	1
while	1
sir	1
william	1
accompanied	1
him	1
charlotte	1
took	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
friend	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
extremely	1
well	1
pleased	1
probably	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
showing	1
it	1
without	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
help	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
small	1
but	1
well	1
built	1
and	1
convenient	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
fitted	1
up	1
and	1
arranged	1
with	1
a	1
neatness	1
and	1
consistency	1
of	1
which	1
elizabeth	1
gave	1
charlotte	1
all	1
the	1
credit	1
when	1
mr	1
collins	1
could	1
be	1
forgotten	1
there	1
was	1
really	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
great	1
comfort	1
throughout	1
and	1
by	1
charlotte	1
s	1
evident	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
it	1
elizabeth	1
supposed	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
often	1
forgotten	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
learnt	1
that	1
lady	1
catherine	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
it	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
again	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
dinner	1
when	1
mr	1
collins	1
joining	1
in	1
observed	1
yes	1
miss	1
elizabeth	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
seeing	1
lady	1
catherine	1
de	1
bourgh	1
on	1
the	1
ensuing	1
sunday	1
at	1
church	1
and	1
i	1
need	1
not	1
say	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
delighted	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
is	1
all	1
affability	1
and	1
condescension	1
and	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
honoured	1
with	1
some	1
portion	1
of	1
her	1
notice	1
when	1
service	1
is	1
over	1
i	1
have	1
scarcely	1
any	1
hesitation	1
in	1
saying	1
she	1
will	1
include	1
you	1
and	1
my	1
sister	1
maria	1
in	1
every	1
invitation	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
honours	1
us	1
during	1
your	1
stay	1
here	1
her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
my	1
dear	1
charlotte	1
is	1
charming	1
we	1
dine	1
at	1
rosings	1
twice	1
every	1
week	1
and	1
are	1
never	1
allowed	1
to	1
walk	1
home	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
carriage	1
is	1
regularly	1
ordered	1
for	1
us	1
i	1
should	1
say	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
carriages	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
several	1
lady	1
catherine	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
sensible	1
woman	1
indeed	1
added	1
charlotte	1
and	1
a	1
most	1
attentive	1
neighbour	1
very	1
true	1
my	1
dear	1
that	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
i	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
woman	1
whom	1
one	1
cannot	1
regard	1
with	1
too	1
much	1
deference	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
chiefly	1
in	1
talking	1
over	1
hertfordshire	1
news	1
and	1
telling	1
again	1
what	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
written	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
closed	1
elizabeth	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
her	1
chamber	1
had	1
to	1
meditate	1
upon	1
charlotte	1
s	1
degree	1
of	1
contentment	1
to	1
understand	1
her	1
address	1
in	1
guiding	1
and	1
composure	1
in	1
bearing	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
very	1
well	1
she	1
had	1
also	1
to	1
anticipate	1
how	1
her	1
visit	1
would	1
pass	1
the	1
quiet	1
tenor	1
of	1
their	1
usual	1
employments	1
the	1
vexatious	1
interruptions	1
of	1
mr	1
collins	1
and	1
the	1
gaieties	1
of	1
their	1
intercourse	1
with	1
rosings	1
a	1
lively	1
imagination	1
soon	1
settled	1
it	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
a	1
sudden	1
noise	1
below	1
seemed	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
in	1
confusion	1
and	1
after	1
listening	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
heard	1
somebody	1
running	1
up	1
stairs	1
in	1
a	1
violent	1
hurry	1
and	1
calling	1
loudly	1
after	1
her	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
met	1
maria	1
in	1
the	1
landing	1
place	1
who	1
breathless	1
with	1
agitation	1
cried	1
out	1
oh	1
my	1
dear	1
eliza	1
pray	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
this	1
moment	1
elizabeth	1
asked	1
questions	1
in	1
vain	1
maria	1
would	1
tell	1
her	1
nothing	1
more	1
and	1
down	1
they	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
which	1
fronted	1
the	1
lane	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
this	1
wonder	1
it	1
was	1
two	1
ladies	1
stopping	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
phaeton	1
at	1
the	1
garden	1
gate	1
and	1
is	1
this	1
all	1
cried	1
elizabeth	1
i	1
expected	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
the	1
pigs	1
were	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
lady	1
catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
la	1
my	1
dear	1
said	1
maria	1
quite	1
shocked	1
at	1
the	1
mistake	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lady	1
catherine	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
is	1
mrs	1
jenkinson	1
who	1
lives	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
only	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
she	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
little	1
creature	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
thin	1
and	1
small	1
she	1
is	1
abominably	1
rude	1
to	1
keep	1
charlotte	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
wind	1
why	1
does	1
she	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
oh	1
charlotte	1
says	1
she	1
hardly	1
ever	1
does	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
favours	1
when	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
comes	1
in	1
i	1
like	1
her	1
appearance	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
struck	1
with	1
other	1
ideas	1
she	1
looks	1
sickly	1
and	1
cross	1
yes	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
very	1
well	1
she	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
proper	1
wife	1
mr	1
collins	1
and	1
charlotte	1
were	1
both	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
sir	1
william	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
high	1
diversion	1
was	1
stationed	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
in	1
earnest	1
contemplation	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
constantly	1
bowing	1
whenever	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
looked	1
that	1
way	1
at	1
length	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
the	1
ladies	1
drove	1
on	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
mr	1
collins	1
no	1
sooner	1
saw	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
than	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
congratulate	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
good	1
fortune	1
which	1
charlotte	1
explained	1
by	1
letting	1
them	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
rosings	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
chapter	1
29	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
triumph	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
invitation	1
was	1
complete	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
displaying	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
his	1
patroness	1
to	1
his	1
wondering	1
visitors	1
and	1
of	1
letting	1
them	1
see	1
her	1
civility	1
towards	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
wished	1
for	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
doing	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
so	1
soon	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
s	1
condescension	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
admire	1
enough	1
i	1
confess	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
surprised	1
by	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
asking	1
us	1
on	1
sunday	1
to	1
drink	1
tea	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
rosings	1
i	1
rather	1
expected	1
from	1
my	1
knowledge	1
of	1
her	1
affability	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
happen	1
but	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
foreseen	1
such	1
an	1
attention	1
as	1
this	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
imagined	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
receive	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
dine	1
there	1
an	1
invitation	1
moreover	1
including	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
so	1
immediately	1
after	1
your	1
arrival	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
less	1
surprised	1
at	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
replied	1
sir	1
william	1
from	1
that	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
really	1
are	1
which	1
my	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
has	1
allowed	1
me	1
to	1
acquire	1
about	1
the	1
court	1
such	1
instances	1
of	1
elegant	1
breeding	1
are	1
not	1
uncommon	1
scarcely	1
anything	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
or	1
next	1
morning	1
but	1
their	1
visit	1
to	1
rosings	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
carefully	1
instructing	1
them	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
such	1
rooms	1
so	1
many	1
servants	1
and	1
so	1
splendid	1
a	1
dinner	1
might	1
not	1
wholly	1
overpower	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
separating	1
for	1
the	1
toilette	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
yourself	1
uneasy	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin	1
about	1
your	1
apparel	1
lady	1
catherine	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
requiring	1
that	1
elegance	1
of	1
dress	1
in	1
us	1
which	1
becomes	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
i	1
would	1
advise	1
you	1
merely	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
whatever	1
of	1
your	1
clothes	1
is	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
anything	1
more	1
lady	1
catherine	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
worse	1
of	1
you	1
for	1
being	1
simply	1
dressed	1
she	1
likes	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
distinction	1
of	1
rank	1
preserved	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
dressing	1
he	1
came	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
to	1
their	1
different	1
doors	1
to	1
recommend	1
their	1
being	1
quick	1
as	1
lady	1
catherine	1
very	1
much	1
objected	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
dinner	1
such	1
formidable	1
accounts	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship	1
and	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
living	1
quite	1
frightened	1
maria	1
lucas	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
little	1
used	1
to	1
company	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
her	1
introduction	1
at	1
rosings	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
apprehension	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
his	1
presentation	1
at	1
st	1
james	1
s	1
as	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
fine	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
walk	1
of	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
across	1
the	1
park	1
every	1
park	1
has	1
its	1
beauty	1
and	1
its	1
prospects	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
saw	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
raptures	1
as	1
mr	1
collins	1
expected	1
the	1
scene	1
to	1
inspire	1
and	1
was	1
but	1
slightly	1
affected	1
by	1
his	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
his	1
relation	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
glazing	1
altogether	1
had	1
originally	1
cost	1
sir	1
lewis	1
de	1
bourgh	1
when	1
they	1
ascended	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
maria	1
s	1
alarm	1
was	1
every	1
moment	1
increasing	1
and	1
even	1
sir	1
william	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
perfectly	1
calm	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
courage	1
did	1
not	1
fail	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
that	1
spoke	1
her	1
awful	1
from	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
talents	1
or	1
miraculous	1
virtue	1
and	1
the	1
mere	1
stateliness	1
of	1
money	1
or	1
rank	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
witness	1
without	1
trepidation	1
from	1
the	1
entrance	1
hall	1
of	1
which	1
mr	1
collins	1
pointed	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
rapturous	1
air	1
the	1
fine	1
proportion	1
and	1
the	1
finished	1
ornaments	1
they	1
followed	1
the	1
servants	1
through	1
an	1
ante	1
chamber	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
lady	1
catherine	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
mrs	1
jenkinson	1
were	1
sitting	1
her	1
ladyship	1
with	1
great	1
condescension	1
arose	1
to	1
receive	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
mrs	1
collins	1
had	1
settled	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
introduction	1
should	1
be	1
hers	1
it	1
was	1
performed	1
in	1
a	1
proper	1
manner	1
without	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
apologies	1
and	1
thanks	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
necessary	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
at	1
st	1
james	1
s	1
sir	1
william	1
was	1
so	1
completely	1
awed	1
by	1
the	1
grandeur	1
surrounding	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
just	1
courage	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
bow	1
and	1
take	1
his	1
seat	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
frightened	1
almost	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
senses	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
her	1
chair	1
not	1
knowing	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look	1
elizabeth	1
found	1
herself	1
quite	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
scene	1
and	1
could	1
observe	1
the	1
three	1
ladies	1
before	1
her	1
composedly	1
lady	1
catherine	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
large	1
woman	1
with	1
strongly	1
marked	1
features	1
which	1
might	1
once	1
have	1
been	1
handsome	1
her	1
air	1
was	1
not	1
conciliating	1
nor	1
was	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
receiving	1
them	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
visitors	1
forget	1
their	1
inferior	1
rank	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
rendered	1
formidable	1
by	1
silence	1
but	1
whatever	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
spoken	1
in	1
so	1
authoritative	1
a	1
tone	1
as	1
marked	1
her	1
self	1
importance	1
and	1
brought	1
mr	1
wickham	1
immediately	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
mind	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
altogether	1
she	1
believed	1
lady	1
catherine	1
to	1
be	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
represented	1
when	1
after	1
examining	1
the	1
mother	1
in	1
whose	1
countenance	1
and	1
deportment	1
she	1
soon	1
found	1
some	1
resemblance	1
of	1
mr	1
darcy	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
daughter	1
she	1
could	1
almost	1
have	1
joined	1
in	1
maria	1
s	1
astonishment	1
at	1
her	1
being	1
so	1
thin	1
and	1
so	1
small	1
there	1
was	1
neither	1
in	1
figure	1
nor	1
face	1
any	1
likeness	1
between	1
the	1
ladies	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
sickly	1
her	1
features	1
though	1
not	1
plain	1
were	1
insignificant	1
and	1
she	1
spoke	1
very	1
little	1
except	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
mrs	1
jenkinson	1
in	1
whose	1
appearance	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
remarkable	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
entirely	1
engaged	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
placing	1
a	1
screen	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
direction	1
before	1
her	1
eyes	1
after	1
sitting	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
sent	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
to	1
admire	1
the	1
view	1
mr	1
collins	1
attending	1
them	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
its	1
beauties	1
and	1
lady	1
catherine	1
kindly	1
informing	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
much	1
better	1
worth	1
looking	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
the	1
dinner	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
handsome	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
plate	1
which	1
mr	1
collins	1
had	1
promised	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
likewise	1
foretold	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
by	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
desire	1
and	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
life	1
could	1
furnish	1
nothing	1
greater	1
he	1
carved	1
and	1
ate	1
and	1
praised	1
with	1
delighted	1
alacrity	1
and	1
every	1
dish	1
was	1
commended	1
first	1
by	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
by	1
sir	1
william	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
enough	1
recovered	1
to	1
echo	1
whatever	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
elizabeth	1
wondered	1
lady	1
catherine	1
could	1
bear	1
but	1
lady	1
catherine	1
seemed	1
gratified	1
by	1
their	1
excessive	1
admiration	1
and	1
gave	1
most	1
gracious	1
smiles	1
especially	1
when	1
any	1
dish	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
proved	1
a	1
novelty	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
party	1
did	1
not	1
supply	1
much	1
conversation	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
speak	1
whenever	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
opening	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
seated	1
between	1
charlotte	1
and	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
the	1
former	1
of	1
whom	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
lady	1
catherine	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
all	1
dinner	1
time	1
mrs	1
jenkinson	1
was	1
chiefly	1
employed	1
in	1
watching	1
how	1
little	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
ate	1
pressing	1
her	1
to	1
try	1
some	1
other	1
dish	1
and	1
fearing	1
she	1
was	1
indisposed	1
maria	1
thought	1
speaking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
eat	1
and	1
admire	1
when	1
the	1
ladies	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
to	1
hear	1
lady	1
catherine	1
talk	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
without	1
any	1
intermission	1
till	1
coffee	1
came	1
in	1
delivering	1
her	1
opinion	1
on	1
every	1
subject	1
in	1
so	1
decisive	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
proved	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
judgement	1
controverted	1
she	1
inquired	1
into	1
charlotte	1
s	1
domestic	1
concerns	1
familiarly	1
and	1
minutely	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
everything	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
regulated	1
in	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
family	1
as	1
hers	1
and	1
instructed	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
cows	1
and	1
her	1
poultry	1
elizabeth	1
found	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
beneath	1
this	1
great	1
lady	1
s	1
attention	1
which	1
could	1
furnish	1
her	1
with	1
an	1
occasion	1
of	1
dictating	1
to	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
her	1
discourse	1
with	1
mrs	1
collins	1
she	1
addressed	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
questions	1
to	1
maria	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
but	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
of	1
whose	1
connections	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
least	1
and	1
who	1
she	1
observed	1
to	1
mrs	1
collins	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
genteel	1
pretty	1
kind	1
of	1
girl	1
she	1
asked	1
her	1
at	1
different	1
times	1
how	1
many	1
sisters	1
she	1
had	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
older	1
or	1
younger	1
than	1
herself	1
whether	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
handsome	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
what	1
carriage	1
her	1
father	1
kept	1
and	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
maiden	1
name	1
elizabeth	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
impertinence	1
of	1
her	1
questions	1
but	1
answered	1
them	1
very	1
composedly	1
lady	1
catherine	1
then	1
observed	1
your	1
father	1
s	1
estate	1
is	1
entailed	1
on	1
mr	1
collins	1
i	1
think	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
turning	1
to	1
charlotte	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
otherwise	1
i	1
see	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
entailing	1
estates	1
from	1
the	1
female	1
line	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
thought	1
necessary	1
in	1
sir	1
lewis	1
de	1
bourgh	1
s	1
family	1
do	1
you	1
play	1
and	1
sing	1
miss	1
bennet	1
a	1
little	1
oh	1
then	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
our	1
instrument	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
one	1
probably	1
superior	1
to	1
you	1
shall	1
try	1
it	1
some	1
day	1
do	1
your	1
sisters	1
play	1
and	1
sing	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
does	1
why	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
all	1
learn	1
you	1
ought	1
all	1
to	1
have	1
learned	1
the	1
miss	1
webbs	1
all	1
play	1
and	1
their	1
father	1
has	1
not	1
so	1
good	1
an	1
income	1
as	1
yours	1
do	1
you	1
draw	1
no	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
not	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
strange	1
but	1
i	1
suppose	1
you	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity	1
your	1
mother	1
should	1
have	1
taken	1
you	1
to	1
town	1
every	1
spring	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
masters	1
my	1
mother	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
objection	1
but	1
my	1
father	1
hates	1
london	1
has	1
your	1
governess	1
left	1
you	1
we	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
governess	1
no	1
governess	1
how	1
was	1
that	1
possible	1
five	1
daughters	1
brought	1
up	1
at	1
home	1
without	1
a	1
governess	1
i	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
your	1
mother	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
quite	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
your	1
education	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
hardly	1
help	1
smiling	1
as	1
she	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
the	1
case	1
then	1
who	1
taught	1
you	1
who	1
attended	1
to	1
you	1
without	1
a	1
governess	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
neglected	1
compared	1
with	1
some	1
families	1
i	1
believe	1
we	1
were	1
but	1
such	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
wished	1
to	1
learn	1
never	1
wanted	1
the	1
means	1
we	1
were	1
always	1
encouraged	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
masters	1
that	1
were	1
necessary	1
those	1
who	1
chose	1
to	1
be	1
idle	1
certainly	1
might	1
aye	1
no	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
a	1
governess	1
will	1
prevent	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
known	1
your	1
mother	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
advised	1
her	1
most	1
strenuously	1
to	1
engage	1
one	1
i	1
always	1
say	1
that	1
nothing	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
education	1
without	1
steady	1
and	1
regular	1
instruction	1
and	1
nobody	1
but	1
a	1
governess	1
can	1
give	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
wonderful	1
how	1
many	1
families	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
supplying	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
i	1
am	1
always	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
young	1
person	1
well	1
placed	1
out	1
four	1
nieces	1
of	1
mrs	1
jenkinson	1
are	1
most	1
delightfully	1
situated	1
through	1
my	1
means	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
that	1
i	1
recommended	1
another	1
young	1
person	1
who	1
was	1
merely	1
accidentally	1
mentioned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
are	1
quite	1
delighted	1
with	1
her	1
mrs	1
collins	1
did	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
lady	1
metcalf	1
s	1
calling	1
yesterday	1
to	1
thank	1
me	1
she	1
finds	1
miss	1
pope	1
a	1
treasure	1
lady	1
catherine	1
said	1
she	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
treasure	1
are	1
any	1
of	1
your	1
younger	1
sisters	1
out	1
miss	1
bennet	1
yes	1
ma	1
am	1
all	1
all	1
what	1
all	1
five	1
out	1
at	1
once	1
very	1
odd	1
and	1
you	1
only	1
the	1
second	1
the	1
younger	1
ones	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
elder	1
ones	1
are	1
married	1
your	1
younger	1
sisters	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
young	1
yes	1
my	1
youngest	1
is	1
not	1
sixteen	1
perhaps	1
she	1
is	1
full	1
young	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
in	1
company	1
but	1
really	1
ma	1
am	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
hard	1
upon	1
younger	1
sisters	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
society	1
and	1
amusement	1
because	1
the	1
elder	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
means	1
or	1
inclination	1
to	1
marry	1
early	1
the	1
last	1
born	1
has	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
youth	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
back	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
motive	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
likely	1
to	1
promote	1
sisterly	1
affection	1
or	1
delicacy	1
of	1
mind	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
said	1
her	1
ladyship	1
you	1
give	1
your	1
opinion	1
very	1
decidedly	1
for	1
so	1
young	1
a	1
person	1
pray	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
age	1
with	1
three	1
younger	1
sisters	1
grown	1
up	1
replied	1
elizabeth	1
smiling	1
your	1
ladyship	1
can	1
hardly	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
own	1
it	1
lady	1
catherine	1
seemed	1
quite	1
astonished	1
at	1
not	1
receiving	1
a	1
direct	1
answer	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
suspected	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
creature	1
who	1
had	1
ever	1
dared	1
to	1
trifle	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
dignified	1
impertinence	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
therefore	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
conceal	1
your	1
age	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
one	1

the	1

when	1

for	1
every	1

if	1

did	1
not	1
say	1
much	1
he	1
was	1
storing	1
his	1
memory	1
with	1
anecdotes	1
and	1
noble	1
names	1
when	1
lady	1
catherine	1
and	1
her	1

played	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
chose	1

broken	1
up	1
the	1

offered	1
to	1

gratefully	1
accepted	1
and	1
immediately	1
ordered	1
the	1
party	1
then	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
fire	1
to	1
hear	1
lady	1
catherine	1
determine	1
what	1
weather	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
from	1
these	1
instructions	1
they	1
were	1
summoned	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
speeches	1
of	1
thankfulness	1
on	1
mr	1

side	1

as	1
many	1

on	1

they	1
departed	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
driven	1

elizabeth	1
was	1
called	1
on	1
by	1
her	1
cousin	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
rosings	1
which	1
for	1
charlotte	1
s	1
sake	1
she	1
made	1
more	1
favourable	1
than	1
it	1
really	1
was	1
but	1
her	1
commendation	1
though	1
costing	1
her	1
some	1
trouble	1
could	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
satisfy	1
mr	1
collins	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
soon	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
praise	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
chapter	1

sir	1
william	1
stayed	1
only	1
a	1
week	1
at	1
hunsford	1
but	1
his	1
visit	1
was	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
convince	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
daughter	1
s	1
being	1
most	1
comfortably	1
settled	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
possessing	1
such	1
a	1
husband	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
neighbour	1
as	1
were	1
not	1
often	1
met	1
with	1
while	1
sir	1
william	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
mr	1
collins	1
devoted	1
his	1
morning	1
to	1
driving	1
him	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
gig	1
and	1
showing	1
him	1
the	1
country	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
usual	1
employments	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
thankful	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
cousin	1
by	1
the	1
alteration	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
between	1
breakfast	1
and	1
dinner	1
was	1
now	1
passed	1
by	1
him	1
either	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
or	1
in	1
reading	1
and	1
writing	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
book	1
room	1
which	1
fronted	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
ladies	1
sat	1
was	1
backwards	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
rather	1
wondered	1
that	1
charlotte	1
should	1
not	1
prefer	1
the	1
dining	1
parlour	1
for	1
common	1
use	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
better	1
sized	1
room	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
more	1
pleasant	1
aspect	1
but	1
she	1
soon	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
friend	1
had	1
an	1
excellent	1
reason	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
for	1
mr	1
collins	1
would	1
undoubtedly	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
less	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
apartment	1
had	1
they	1
sat	1
in	1
one	1
equally	1
lively	1
and	1
she	1
gave	1
charlotte	1
credit	1
for	1
the	1
arrangement	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
they	1
could	1
distinguish	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
lane	1
and	1
were	1
indebted	1
to	1
mr	1
collins	1
for	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
carriages	1
went	1
along	1
and	1
how	1
often	1
especially	1
miss	1
de	1
bourgh	1
drove	1
by	1
in	1
her	1
phaeton	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
failed	1
coming	1
to	1
inform	1
them	1
of	1
though	1
it	1
happened	1
almost	1
every	1
day	1
she	1
not	1
unfrequently	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
parsonage	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
conversation	1
with	1
charlotte	1
but	1
was	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
very	1
few	1
days	1
passed	1
in	1
which	1
mr	1
collins	1
did	1
not	1
walk	1
to	1
rosings	1
and	1
not	1
many	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
likewise	1
and	1
till	1
elizabeth	1
recollected	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
other	1
family	1
livings	1
to	1
be	1
disposed	1
of	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
honoured	1
with	1
a	1
call	1
from	1
her	1
ladyship	1
and	1
nothing	1
escaped	1
her	1
observation	1
that	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
during	1
these	1
visits	1
she	1
examined	1
into	1
their	1
employments	1
looked	1
at	1
their	1
work	1
and	1
advised	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
differently	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
furniture	1
or	1
detected	1
the	1
housemaid	1
in	1
negligence	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
accepted	1
any	1
refreshment	1
seemed	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
finding	1
out	1
that	1
mrs	1
collins	1
s	1
joints	1
of	1
meat	1
were	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
her	1
family	1
elizabeth	1
soon	1
perceived	1
that	1
though	1
this	1
great	1
lady	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
commission	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
county	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
active	1
magistrate	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
parish	1
the	1
minutest	1
concerns	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
carried	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
mr	1
collins	1
and	1
whenever	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
were	1
disposed	1
to	1
be	1
quarrelsome	1
discontented	1
or	1
too	1
poor	1
she	1
sallied	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
settle	1
their	1
differences	1
silence	1
their	1
complaints	1
and	1
scold	1
them	1
into	1
harmony	1
and	1
plenty	1
the	1
entertainment	1
of	1
dining	1
at	1
rosings	1
was	1
repeated	1
about	1
twice	1
a	1
week	1
and	1
allowing	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
sir	1
william	1
and	1
there	1
being	1
only	1
one	1
card	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
every	1
such	1
entertainment	1
was	1
the	1
counterpart	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
their	1
other	1
engagements	1
were	1
few	1
as	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
in	1
general	1
was	1
beyond	1
mr	1
collins	1
s	1
reach	1
this	1
however	1
was	1
no	1
evil	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
she	1
spent	1
her	1
time	1
comfortably	1
enough	1
there	1
were	1
half	1
hours	1
of	1
pleasant	1
conversation	1
with	1
charlotte	1
and	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
so	1
fine	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
year	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
great	1
enjoyment	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
her	1
favourite	1
walk	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
frequently	1
went	1
while	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
calling	1
on	1
lady	1
catherine	1
was	1
along	1
the	1
open	1
grove	1
which	1
edged	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
park	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
nice	1
sheltered	1
path	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
seemed	1
to	1
value	1
but	1
herself	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
felt	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
s	1
curiosity	1
in	1
this	1
quiet	1
way	1
the	1
first	1
fortnight	1
of	1
her	1
visit	1
soon	1
passed	1
away	1
easter	1
was	1
approaching	1
and	1
the	1
week	1
preceding	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
bring	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
at	1
rosings	1
which	1
in	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
circle	1
must	1
be	1
important	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
heard	1
soon	1
after	1
her	1
arrival	1
that	1
mr	1
darcy	1
was	1
expected	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
and	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
whom	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
prefer	1
his	1
coming	1
would	1
furnish	1
one	1
comparatively	1
new	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
in	1
their	1
rosings	1
parties	1
and	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
amused	1
in	1
seeing	1
how	1
hopeless	1
miss	1
bingley	1
s	1
designs	1
on	1
him	1
were	1
by	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
his	1
cousin	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
destined	1
by	1
lady	1
catherine	1
who	1
talked	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
satisfaction	1
spoke	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
admiration	1
and	1
seemed	1
almost	1
angry	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
frequently	1
seen	1
by	1
miss	1
lucas	1
and	1
herself	1
his	1
arrival	1
was	1
soon	1
known	1
at	1
the	1
parsonage	1
for	1
mr	1
collins	1
was	1
walking	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
lodges	1
opening	1
into	1
hunsford	1
lane	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
earliest	1
assurance	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
after	1
making	1
his	1
bow	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
park	1
hurried	1
home	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
intelligence	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
morning	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
rosings	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
respects	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
nephews	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
to	1
require	1
them	1
for	1
mr	1
darcy	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
colonel	1
fitzwilliam	1
the	1
younger	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
uncle	1
lord	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
surprise	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
party	1
when	1
mr	1
collins	1
returned	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
accompanied	1
him	1
charlotte	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
room	1
crossing	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
immediately	1
running	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
told	1
the	1
girls	1
what	1
an	1
honour	1
they	1
might	1
expect	1
adding	1
i	1
may	1
thank	1
you	1
eliza	1
for	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
civility	1
mr	1
darcy	1
would	1

soon	1

elizabeth	1
had	1
scarcely	1
time	1
to	1
disclaim	1
all	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
compliment	1
before	1
their	1
approach	1
was	1
announced	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
bell	1
and	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
the	1
three	1
gentlemen	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
colonel	1
fitzwilliam	1
who	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
about	1
thirty	1
not	1
handsome	1
but	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
address	1
most	1
truly	1
the	1
gentleman	1
mr	1
darcy	1
looked	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
look	1
in	1
hertfordshire	1
paid	1
his	1
compliments	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
reserve	1
to	1
mrs	1
collins	1
and	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
his	1
feelings	1
toward	1
her	1
friend	1
met	1
her	1
with	1
every	1
appearance	1
of	1
composure	1
elizabeth	1
merely	1
curtseyed	1
to	1
him	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
colonel	1
fitzwilliam	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
directly	1
with	1
the	1
readiness	1
and	1
ease	1
of	1
a	1
well	1
bred	1
man	1
and	1
talked	1
very	1
pleasantly	1
but	1
his	1
cousin	1
after	1
having	1
addressed	1
a	1
slight	1
observation	1
on	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
to	1
mrs	1
collins	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
speaking	1
to	1
anybody	1
at	1
length	1
however	1
his	1
civility	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
awakened	1
as	1
to	1
inquire	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
after	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
her	1
family	1
she	1
answered	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
way	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
pause	1
added	1
my	1
eldest	1
sister	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
town	1
these	1
three	1
months	1
have	1
you	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
there	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
sensible	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
but	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
betray	1
any	1
consciousness	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
bingleys	1
and	1
jane	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
confused	1
as	1
he	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
meet	1
miss	1
bennet	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
pursued	1
no	1
farther	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1

afterwards	1
went	1
away	1

colonel	1
fitzwilliam	1
s	1
manners	1
were	1
very	1
much	1
admired	1
at	1
the	1
parsonage	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
add	1
considerably	1
to	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
their	1
engagements	1
at	1
rosings	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
days	1
however	1
before	1
they	1
received	1
any	1
invitation	1
thither	1
for	1
while	1
there	1
were	1
visitors	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
necessary	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
easter	1
day	1
almost	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
s	1
arrival	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
honoured	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
attention	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
merely	1
asked	1
on	1
leaving	1
church	1
to	1
come	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
week	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
or	1
her	1
daughter	1
colonel	1
fitzwilliam	1
had	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
parsonage	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
but	1
mr	1
darcy	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
only	1
at	1
church	1
the	1
invitation	1
was	1
accepted	1
of	1
course	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
proper	1
hour	1
they	1
joined	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
lady	1
catherine	1
s	1
drawing	1
room	1
her	1
ladyship	1
received	1
them	1
civilly	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
their	1
company	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
acceptable	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
could	1
get	1
nobody	1
else	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
almost	1
engrossed	1
by	1
her	1
nephews	1
speaking	1
to	1
them	1
especially	1
to	1
darcy	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
colonel	1
fitzwilliam	1
seemed	1
really	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
anything	1
was	1
a	1
welcome	1
relief	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
rosings	1
and	1
mrs	1
collins	1
s	1
pretty	1
friend	1
had	1
moreover	1
caught	1
his	1
fancy	1
very	1
much	1
he	1
now	1
seated	1
himself	1
by	1
her	1
and	1
talked	1
so	1
agreeably	1
of	1
kent	1
and	1
hertfordshire	1
of	1
travelling	1
and	1
staying	1
at	1
home	1
of	1
new	1
books	1
and	1
music	1
that	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
half	1
so	1
well	1
entertained	1
in	1
that	1
room	1
before	1
and	1
they	1
conversed	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
spirit	1
and	1
flow	1
as	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
lady	1
catherine	1
herself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
mr	1
darcy	1
his	1
eyes	1
had	1
been	1
soon	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
turned	1
towards	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
curiosity	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
shared	1
the	1
feeling	1
was	1
more	1
openly	1
acknowledged	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
scruple	1
to	1
call	1
out	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
saying	1
fitzwilliam	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
of	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
telling	1
miss	1
bennet	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
music	1
madam	1
said	1
he	1
when	1
no	1
longer	1
able	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
reply	1
of	1
music	1
then	1
pray	1
speak	1
aloud	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
all	1
subjects	1
my	1
delight	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
my	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
music	1
there	1
are	1
few	1
people	1
in	1
england	1
i	1
suppose	1
who	1
have	1
more	1
true	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
music	1
than	1
myself	1
or	1
a	1
better	1
natural	1
taste	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
learnt	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
proficient	1
and	1
so	1
would	1
anne	1
if	1
her	1
health	1
had	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
apply	1
i	1
am	1
confident	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
performed	1
delightfully	1
how	1
does	1
georgiana	1
get	1
on	1
darcy	1
mr	1
darcy	1
spoke	1
with	1
affectionate	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
proficiency	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
said	1
lady	1
catherine	1
and	1
pray	1
tell	1
her	1
from	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
cannot	1
expect	1
to	1
excel	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
practice	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
madam	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
need	1
such	1
advice	1
she	1
practises	1
very	1
constantly	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
done	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
next	1
write	1
to	1
her	1
i	1
shall	1
charge	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
neglect	1
it	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
i	1
often	1
tell	1
young	1
ladies	1
that	1
no	1
excellence	1
in	1
music	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
acquired	1
without	1
constant	1
practice	1
i	1
have	1
told	1
miss	1
bennet	1
several	1
times	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
never	1
play	1
really	1
well	1
unless	1
she	1
practises	1
more	1
and	1
though	1
mrs	1
collins	1
has	1
no	1
instrument	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
welcome	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
rosings	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
in	1
mrs	1
jenkinson	1
s	1
room	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
nobody	1
s	1
way	1
you	1
know	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
mr	1
darcy	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
aunt	1
s	1
ill	1
breeding	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
when	1
coffee	1
was	1
over	1
colonel	1
fitzwilliam	1
reminded	1
elizabeth	1
of	1
having	1
promised	1
to	1
play	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
instrument	1
he	1
drew	1
a	1
chair	1
near	1
her	1
lady	1
catherine	1
listened	1
to	1
half	1
a	1
song	1
and	1
then	1
talked	1
as	1
before	1
to	1
her	1
other	1
nephew	1
till	1
the	1
latter	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
making	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
deliberation	1
towards	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
stationed	1
himself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
command	1
a	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
performer	1
s	1
countenance	1
elizabeth	1
saw	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
convenient	1
pause	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
arch	1
smile	1
and	1
said	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
frighten	1
me	1
mr	1
darcy	1
by	1
coming	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
state	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
alarmed	1
though	1
your	1
sister	1
does	1
play	1
so	1
well	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
stubbornness	1
about	1
me	1
that	1
never	1
can	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
others	1
my	1
courage	1
always	1
rises	1
at	1
every	1
attempt	1
to	1
intimidate	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
say	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
he	1
replied	1
because	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
really	1
believe	1
me	1
to	1
entertain	1
any	1
design	1
of	1
alarming	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
find	1
great	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
occasionally	1
professing	1
opinions	1
which	1
in	1
fact	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
own	1
elizabeth	1
laughed	1
heartily	1
at	1
this	1
picture	1
of	1
herself	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
colonel	1
fitzwilliam	1
your	1
cousin	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
notion	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
teach	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
i	1
say	1
i	1
am	1
particularly	1
unlucky	1
in	1
meeting	1
with	1
a	1
person	1
so	1
able	1
to	1
expose	1
my	1
real	1
character	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
pass	1
myself	1
off	1
with	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
credit	1
indeed	1
mr	1
darcy	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
ungenerous	1
in	1
you	1
to	1
mention	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
knew	1
to	1
my	1
disadvantage	1
in	1
hertfordshire	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
say	1
very	1
impolitic	1
too	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
provoking	1
me	1
to	1
retaliate	1
and	1
such	1
things	1
may	1
come	1
out	1
as	1
will	1
shock	1
your	1
relations	1
to	1
hear	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
smilingly	1
pray	1
let	1
me	1

you	1
